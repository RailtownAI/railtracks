You are reviewing railtracks code against the current API. PASS only if every item holds:
- The server is connected with `rt.connect_mcp(rt.MCPStdioParams(command="uvx", args=["mcp-server-fetch"]))`.
- The agent gets the server's tools with `tool_nodes=server.tools` (or a list built from it).
- It runs through `rt.Flow(..., entry_point=<Agent>)` and prints `result.content`.
- `import railtracks as rt`, and every `rt.agent_node(...)` call passes `llm=` (e.g. `rt.llm.OpenAILLM("<model>")`).
- Agent variables are PascalCase.
- Agents run through `rt.Flow` (`flow.invoke` / `await flow.ainvoke`), `await rt.call(...)` inside a node, or `rt.astream(...)` when streaming, never `rt.Session()`; agent results are read with `.content`, never `.text` or `.structured`.
- No invented or removed APIs: no `stream=True` on a model, no `guardrails=` argument, no `Guard(...)`, no `rt.interactive`, no `rt.Agent`/`rt.Tool` classes, no `.run()`/`.chat()` on an agent.
Judge only these items. Variable names in them are placeholders, and extra helper functions, safety checks, comments, docstrings, and stylistic choices are fine: never FAIL for something the items don't mention.
FAIL if any item is missing or wrong; name the item.

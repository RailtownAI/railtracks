Some courts have\nruled that Title VII also bans discrimination based on sexual orientation or\ngender identity. The Supreme Court recently announced it will take up this\nquestion in three cases. In addition, many states and cities have laws that\nban this kind of discrimination.\n\n###  If you believe that your rights have been violated\n\nIf you think that you have experienced discrimination at work, you can file a\ncomplaint with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), which\nhas taken the position that LGBTQ people are protected under Title VII.

Clayton County)  _ ,\ndiscrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity is sex\ndiscrimination. Thus,  **The Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination on the\nbasis of sexual orientation or gender identity.** State and local laws where\nyou live may also bar this discrimination. Housing discrimination against\npeople with HIV/AIDS, or people perceived to have HIV/AIDS, is also illegal\nunder the Fair Housing Act\u2019s protections against disability discrimination.\nHousing providers that receive funding from the Department of Housing and\nUrban Development (HUD) or have loans insured by the Federal Housing\nAdministration (FHA), as well as lenders insured by FHA, are subject to HUD\u2019s\nEqual Access Rule, which bans discrimination in HUD programs on the basis of\nsexual orientation or gender identity.\n\n###  If you believe your rights have been violated\n\nWhat you can do depends largely on where the discrimination took place,\nwhether any state or local laws there might apply to your situation, and where\nthings stand under the current administration.

Thus,  **Title IX prohibits students\nfrom discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity.**\nFederal courts have held that Title IX requires public schools to respond to\nharassment based on appearance or behavior that doesn\u2019t conform to gender\nstereotypes: boys who wear makeup, girls who wear pants, or students who are\ntransgender or non-binary. The First Amendment right to free expression can\nalso apply to school dress codes, especially when there are different rules\nfor boys than there are for girls. Your constitutional right to privacy makes\nit illegal for your school to \u201cout\u201d you to anyone without your permission,\neven if you\u2019re out to other people at school. The First Amendment protects\nyour right to express yourself in public schools. That includes bringing a\nsame-sex date to prom or any school event and talking about LGBTQ topics. Your\nright to be yourself in school includes the right to be transgender or non-\nbinary, and to transition at school. While the law in this area is evolving, a\ngrowing number of courts have found that Title IX and the Constitution protect\ntransgender students\u2019 right to access sex-separated programs and facilities\nconsistent with their gender identity.

We believe that laws that ban\nsex discrimination should also be interpreted by the courts to protect\ntransgender people. While federal law in this area is uncertain, most courts\nto address this question have found in favor of transgender people being able\nto access facilities most consistent with their gender identity.\n\nIn some places, state and local nondiscrimination laws are much clearer about\ntransgender people\u2019s right to use gender identity-appropriate public\nrestrooms.

    "content": "The lens,  or crystalline lens, is a transparent biconvex structure in most land vertebrate eyes. Along with the cornea, aqueous and vitreous humours it refracts light, focusing it onto the retina. In many land animals the shape of the lens can be altered, effectively changing the focal length of the eye, enabling them to focus on objects at various distances. This adjustment of the lens is known as accommodation (see also below). In many fully aquatic vertebrates such as fish other methods of accommodation are used such as changing the lens's position relative to the retina rather than changing lens shape.  Accommodation is analogous to the focusing of a photographic camera via changing its lenses. In land vertebrates the lens is flatter on its anterior side than on its posterior side, while in fish the lens is often close to spherical.\nAccommodation in humans is well studied and allows artificial means of supplementing our focus such as glasses for correction of sight as we age. The refractive power of a younger human lens in its natural environment is approximately 18 dioptres, roughly one-third of the eye's total power of about 60 dioptres. By 25 years of age the ability of the lens to alter the light path has reduced to 10 dioptres and accommodation continues to decline with age.\n\nStructure[edit]\nPosition in the eye[edit]\nThe lens is located towards the front part of the vertebrate eye called the anterior segment which includes the cornea and iris positioned in front of the lens. The lens is held in place by the suspensory ligaments (Zonule of Zinn), attaching the lens at its equator to the rest of the eye through the ciliary body. Behind the lens is the jelly-like vitreous body which helps hold the lens in place. At the front of the lens is the liquid aqueous humor which bathes the lens with nutrients and other things. Land vertebrate lenses usually have an ellipsoid, biconvex shape. The front surface is less curved than the back. A human adult the lens is typically about 10mm in diameter and 4mm thick though changes shape with accommodation and size due to grow throughout a person's lifetime.\nAnatomy[edit]\n3D lens model from sheep with parts labeled and images of cells from different parts overlayed\nSheep eye lens para-formaldehyde fixed front view. Small lenses are about 1cm in diameter. Small bumps at edge are remnants of suspensory ligaments\nSheep lens fixed side view. Note the largest lens has damaged capsule and iris attached\nMicroscope image of lens cell types and capsule\nThe lens has three main parts: the lens capsule, the lens epithelium, and the lens fibers. The lens capsule is a relatively thick basement membrane forming the outermost layer of the lens. Inside the capsule much thinner lens fibers form the bulk of the lens. The cells of the lens epithelium form a thin layer between the lens capsule and the outermost layer of lens fibers at the front of the lens but not the back. The lens itself lacks nerves, blood vessels, or connective tissue. Anatomists will often refer to positions of structures in the lens by describing it like a globe of the world. The front and back of the lens are referred to as the anterior and posterior \"poles\", like the North and South poles. The \"equator\" is the outer edge of the lens often hidden by the iris and is the area of most cell differentiation. As the equator is not generally in the light path of the eye the structures involved with metabolic activity avoid scattering light that would otherwise affect vision.\nLens capsule[edit]\nMain article: Capsule of lens\nSheep lens capsule removed. Decapsulation leads to a nearly formless blob.\nA foot on a mouse lens capsule suspensory ligament forming part of the Zonule of Zinn\nThe lens capsule is a smooth, transparent basement membrane that completely surrounds the lens. The capsule is elastic and its main structural component is collagen. It is presumed to be synthesized by the lens epithelium and its main components in order of abundance are heparan sulfate proteoglycan (sulfated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs)), entactin, type IV collagen, laminin. The capsule is very elastic and so allows the lens to assume a more spherical shape when the tension of the suspensory ligaments is reduced. The human capsule varies from 2 to 28 micrometres in thickness, being thickest near the equator (peri-equatorial region) and generally thinner near the posterior pole. \nThe photo from an electron microscope shows an area of the capsule near the equator where one of the thousands of suspensory ligaments attach.\nLens showing feet attached to the eye lens capsule with smaller feet embedded in the capsule\nAttachment must be strong enough to stop the ligament being detached from the lens capsule. Forces are generated from holding the lens in place and added to when focusing. The anterior and posterior capsule is thinner.\nLens epithelium[edit]\nThe lens epithelium is a single layer of cells at the front of the lens between the lens capsule and the lens fibers. By providing the lens fibers with nutrients and removing waste the cells of the  epithelium regulate maintain lens homeostasis. As ions, nutrients, and liquid enter the lens from the aqueous humor, Na/K-ATPase pumps in the lens epithelial cells pump ions out of the lens to maintain appropriate lens osmotic concentration and volume, with equatorially positioned lens epithelium cells contributing most to this current. The activity of the Na/K-ATPases keeps water and current flowing through the lens from the poles and exiting through the equatorial regions.\nThe cells of the lens epithelium also divide into new lens fibers at the lens equator. The lens lays down fibers from when it first forms in embryo until death.\nLens fibers[edit]\nThe lens fibers form the bulk of the lens. They are long, thin, transparent cells, firmly packed, with diameters typically 4\u20137 micrometres and lengths of up to 12mm long in humans. The lens fibers stretch lengthwise from the posterior to the anterior poles and, when cut horizontally, are arranged in concentric layers rather like the layers of an onion. If cut along the equator, it appears as a honeycomb. The approximate middle of each fiber lies around the equator. These tightly packed layers of lens fibers are referred to as laminae. The lens fiber cytoplasms are linked together via gap junctions, intercellular bridges and interdigitations of the cells that resemble \"ball and socket\" forms.\nThe lens is split into regions depending on the age of the lens fibers of a particular layer. Moving outwards from the central, oldest layer, the lens is split into an embryonic nucleus, the fetal nucleus, the adult nucleus, the inner and outer cortex. New lens fibers, generated from the lens epithelium, are added to the outer cortex. Mature lens fibers have no organelles or nuclei.\nCell fusion, voids and vacuoles[edit]\nCellular and supercellular structure in the mouse lens. Photos at increasing depth: A-Epithelium B-Broadening fiber ends C-Fiber ends lock together D-F- Voids G-Vacuoles I-Sutures\nLeft to right we have a smooth capsule, a small patch of epithelium next to fused lens fibers or perhaps a void, straighter fibers, and finally wrinkled fibers\nWith the advent of other ways of looking at cellular structures of lenses while still in the living animal it became apparent that regions of fiber cells, at least at the lens anterior, contain large voids and vacuoles. These are speculated to be involved in lens transport systems linking the surface of the lens to deeper regions. Very similar looking structures also indicate cell fusion in the lens. The cell fusion is shown by micro-injection to form a stratified syncytium in whole lens cultures.\nDevelopment[edit]\nSimilar to a human, this is a lens forming in a chicken eye\nDevelopment of the vertebrate lens begins when the human embryo is about 4mm long. The accompanying picture shows the process in a more easily studied chicken embryo. Unlike the rest of the eye which is derived mostly from the inner embryo layers, the lens is derived from the  skin around the embryo. The first stage of lens formation takes place when  a sphere of cells formed by budding of the inner embryo layers comes close to the embyro's outer skin.  The sphere of cells induces nearby outer skin to start changing into the lens placode. The lens placode is the first stage of transformation of a patch of skin into the lens. At this early stage, the lens placode is a single layer of cells.\nAs development progresses, the lens placode begins to deepen and bow inwards. As the placode continues to deepen, the opening to the surface ectoderm constricts and the lens cells bud off from the embryo's skin to form a sphere of cells known as the \"lens vesicle\". When the embryo is about 10mm long the lens vesicle has completely separated from the skin of the embryo.\nThe embryo then sends signals from the developing retina, inducing the cells closest to the posterior end of the lens vesicle to elongate toward the anterior end of the vesicle.  These signals also induce the synthesis of proteins called crystallins. As the name suggests the crystallins can form a clear highly refractive jelly. These elongating cells eventually fill in the center of the vesicle with cells, that are long and thin like a strand of hair, called fibers. These primary fibers become the nucleus in the mature lens. The epithelial cells that do not form into fibers nearest the lens front give rise to the lens epithelium.\nPattern of lens fibers (anterior and lateral aspect)\nAdditional fibers are derived from lens epithelial cells located at the lens equator. These cells lengthen towards the front and back wrapping around fibers already laid down. The new fibers need to be longer to cover earlier fibers but as the lens gets larger the ends of the newer fibers no longer reach as far towards the front and back of the lens. The lens fibers that do not reach the poles form tight, interdigitating seams with neighboring fibers. These seams being less crystalline than the bulk of the lens are more visible and are termed \"sutures\". The suture patterns become more complex as more layers of lens fibers are added to the outer portion of the lens.\nThe lens continues to grow after birth, with the new secondary fibers being added as outer layers. New lens fibers are generated from the equatorial cells of the lens epithelium, in a region referred to as the \"germinative zone\" and \"bow region\". The lens epithelial cells elongate, lose contact with the capsule and epithelium at the back and front of the lens, synthesize crystallin, and then finally lose their nuclei (enucleate) as they become mature lens fibers. In humans, as the lens grows by laying down more fibers through to early adulthood, the lens becomes more ellipsoid in shape. After about age 20 the lens grows rounder again and the iris is very important for this development.\nSeveral proteins control the embryonic development of the lens though PAX6 is considered the master regulator gene of this organ. Other effectors of proper lens development include the Wnt signaling components BCL9 and Pygo2. The whole process of differentiation of the epithelial cells into crystallin filled fiber cells without organelles occurs within the confines of the lens capsule. Older cells cannot be shed and are instead internalized towards the center of the lens. This process results in a complete temporally layered record of the differentiation process from the start at the lens surface to the end at the lens center. The lens is therefore valuable to scientists studying the process of cell differentiation.\nVariations in lens structure[edit]\nBony fish eye. Note the spherical lens and muscle to pull the lens backward\nIn many aquatic vertebrates, the lens is considerably thicker, almost spherical resulting in increased light refraction. This difference helps compensate for the smaller angle of refraction between the eye's cornea and the watery environment, as they have more similar refractive indices than cornea and air. The fiber cells of fish are generally considerably thinner than those of land vertebrates and it appears crystalin proteins are transported to the organelle free cells at the lens exterior to the inner cells through many layers of cells. Some vertebrates need to see well both above and below water at times. One example is diving birds which have the ability to change focus by 50 to 80  dioptres. Compared with animals adapted for only one environment diving birds have a somewhat altered lens and cornea structure with focus mechanisms to allow for both environments. Even among terrestrial animals the lens of primates such as humans is unusually flat going some way to explain why our vision, unlike diving birds, is particularly blurry under water.\n\nFunction[edit]\nFocusing[edit]\nAn image that is partially in focus, but mostly out of focus in varying degrees.\nEye and detailed ray path including one intraocular lens layer\nIn humans the widely quoted Helmholtz mechanism of focusing, also called accommodation, is often referred to as a \"model\". Direct experimental proof of any lens model is necessarily difficult as the vertebrate lens is transparent and only functions well in the living animals. When considering all vertebrates aspects of all models may play varying roles in lens focus.\nThe shape changing lens of many land based vertebrates[edit]\n3D reconstruction of lens in a living 20 year old human male focusing from 0 dioptres (infinity) to 4.85 dioptres (26mm) side & back views\nExternal forces[edit]\nTwo horse lenses suspended on water by cling wrap with 4 approximately parallel lasers directed through them. The 1 cm spaced grid indicates an accommodated, i.e. relaxed, near focus, focal length of around 6cm\nThe model of a shape changing lens of humans was proposed by Young in a lecture on the 27th Nov 1800. Others such as Helmholtz and Huxley refined the model in the mid 1800s explaining how the ciliary muscle contracts rounding the lens to focus near and this model was popularized by Helmholtz in 1909. The model may be summarized like this. Normally the lens is held under tension by its suspending ligaments being pulled tight by the pressure of the eyeball. At short focal distance the ciliary muscle contracts relieving some of the tension on the ligaments, allowing the lens to elastically round up  a bit, increasing refractive power. Changing focus to an object at a greater distance requires a thinner less curved lens. This is achieved by relaxing some of the sphincter like ciliary muscles. While not referenced this presumably allows the pressure in the eyeball to again expand it outwards, pulling harder on the lens making it less curved and thinner, so increasing the focal distance. There is a problem with the Helmholtz model in that despite mathematical models being tried none has come close enough to working using only the Helmholtz mechanisms.\nSchachar model of lens focus\nSchachar has proposed a model for land based vertebrates that was not well received. The theory allows mathematical modeling to more accurately reflect the way the lens focuses while also taking into account the complexities in the suspensory ligaments and the presence of radial as well as circular muscles in the ciliary body. In this model the ligaments may pull to varying degrees on the lens at the equator using the radial muscles while the ligaments offset from the equator to the front and back are relaxed to varying degrees by contracting the circular muscles. These multiple actions operating on the elastic lens allows it to change lens shape at the front more subtly. Not only changing focus, but also correcting for lens aberrations that might otherwise result from the changing shape while better fitting mathematical modeling.\nThe \"catenary\" model of lens focus proposed by Coleman demands less tension on the ligaments suspending the lens. Rather than the lens as a whole being stretched thinner for distance vision and allowed to relax for near focus, contraction of the circular ciliary muscles results in the lens having less hydrostatic pressure against its front. The lens front can then reform its shape between the suspensory ligaments in a similar way to a slack chain hanging between two poles might change it's curve when the poles are moved closer together. This model requires fluid movement of the lens front only rather than trying to change the shape of the lens as a whole.\nInternal forces[edit]\nTracing of Scheimpflug photographs of 20 year old human lens being thicker focusing near and thinner when focusing far. Internal layering of the lens is also significant\nWrinkled lens fibers in picture below compared to straight fibers above\nWhen Thomas Young proposed the changing of the human lens's shape as the mechanism for focal accommodation in 1801 he thought the lens may be a muscle capable of contraction. This type of model is termed intracapsular accommodation as it relies on activity within the lens. In a 1911 Nobel lecture Allvar Gullstrand spoke on \"How I found the intracapsular mechanism of accommodation\" and this aspect of lens focusing continues to be investigated. Young spent time searching for the nerves that could stimulate the lens to contract without success. Since that time it has become clear the lens is not a simple muscle stimulated by a nerve so the 1909 Helmholtz model took precedence. Pre-twentieth century investigators did not have the benefit of many later discoveries and techniques. Membrane proteins such as aquaporins which allow water to flow into and out of cells are the most abundant membrane protein in the lens. Connexins which allow electrical coupling of cells are also prevalent. Electron microscopy and immunofluorescent microscopy show fiber cells to be highly variable in structure and composition. Magnetic resonance imaging confirms a layering in the lens that may allow for different refractive plans within it. The refractive index of human lens varies from approximately 1.406 in the central layers down to 1.386 in less dense layers of the lens. This index gradient enhances the optical power of the lens. As more is learned about mammalian lens structure from in situ Scheimpflug photography, MRI and physiological investigations it is becoming apparent the lens itself is not responding entirely passively to the surrounding ciliary muscle but may be able to change its overall refractive index through mechanisms involving water dynamics in the lens still to be clarified. The accompanying micrograph shows wrinkled fibers from a relaxed sheep lens after it is removed from the animal indicating shortening of the lens fibers during near focus accommodation. The age related changes in the human lens may also be related to changes in the water dynamics in the lens.\nLenses of birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish and others[edit]\nDiving bird (Cormorant) lens focusing can be up to 80 dioptres for clearer underwater vision.\nBony fish eye. Note the spherical lens and muscle to pull the lens backward\nIn reptiles and birds, the ciliary body which supports the lens via suspensory ligaments also touches the lens with a number of pads on its inner surface. These pads compress and release the lens to modify its shape while focusing on objects at different distances; the suspensory ligaments usually perform this function in mammals. With vision in fish and amphibians, the lens is fixed in shape, and focusing is instead achieved by moving the lens forwards or backwards within the eye using a muscle called the retractor lentus.\nIn cartilaginous fish, the suspensory ligaments are replaced by a membrane, including a small muscle at the underside of the lens. This muscle pulls the lens forward from its relaxed position when focusing on nearby objects. In teleosts, by contrast, a muscle projects from a vascular structure in the floor of the eye, called the falciform process, and serves to pull the lens backwards from the relaxed position to focus on distant objects. While amphibians move the lens forward, as do cartilaginous fish, the muscles involved are not similar  in either type of animal. In frogs, there are two muscles, one above and one below the lens, while other amphibians have only the lower muscle.\nIn the simplest vertebrates, the lampreys and hagfish, the lens is not attached to the outer surface of the eyeball at all. There is no aqueous humor in these fish, and the vitreous body simply presses the lens against the surface of the cornea. To focus its eyes, a lamprey flattens the cornea using muscles outside of the eye and pushes the lens backwards.\nWhile not vertebrate, brief mention is made here of the convergent evolution of vertebrate and Molluscan eyes. The most complex Molluscan eye is the Cephalopod eye which is superficially similar structure and function to a vertebrate eye, including accommodation, while differing in basic ways such as having a two part lens and no cornea. The fundamental requirements of optics must be filled by all eyes with lenses using the tissues at their disposal so superficially eyes all tend to look similar. It is the way optical requirements are met using different cell types and structural mechanisms that varies among animals.\nCrystallins and transparency[edit]\nGraph showing optical density (OD) of the human crystalline lens for newborn, 30-year-old, and 65-year-old from wavelengths 300-1400 nm.\nCrystallins are water-soluble proteins that compose over 90% of the protein within the lens. The three main crystallin types found in the human eye are \u03b1-, \u03b2-, and \u03b3-crystallins. Crystallins tend to form soluble, high-molecular weight aggregates that pack tightly in lens fibers, thus increasing the index of refraction of the lens while maintaining its transparency. \u03b2 and \u03b3 crystallins are found primarily in the lens, while subunits of \u03b1 -crystallin have been isolated from other parts of the eye and the body. \u03b1-crystallin proteins belong to a larger superfamily of molecular chaperone proteins, and so it is believed that the crystallin proteins were evolutionarily recruited from chaperone proteins for optical purposes. The chaperone functions of \u03b1-crystallin may also help maintain the lens proteins, which must last a human for their entire lifetime.\nAnother important factor in maintaining the transparency of the lens is the absence of light-scattering organelles such as the nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum, and mitochondria within the mature lens fibers. Lens fibers also have a very extensive cytoskeleton that maintains the precise shape and packing of the lens fibers; disruptions/mutations in certain cytoskeletal elements can lead to the loss of transparency.\nThe lens blocks most ultraviolet light in the wavelength range of 300\u2013400\u00a0nm; shorter wavelengths are blocked by the cornea.  The pigment responsible for blocking the light is 3-hydroxykynurenine glucoside, a product of tryptophan catabolism in the lens epithelium.  High intensity ultraviolet light can harm the retina, and artificial intraocular lenses are therefore manufactured to also block ultraviolet light. People lacking a lens (a condition known as aphakia) perceive ultraviolet light as whitish blue or whitish-violet.\nNourishment[edit]\nThe lens is metabolically active and requires nourishment in order to maintain its growth and transparency. Compared to other tissues in the eye, however, the lens has considerably lower energy demands.\nBy nine weeks into human development, the lens is surrounded and nourished by a net of vessels, the tunica vasculosa lentis, which is derived from the hyaloid artery.  Beginning in the fourth month of development, the hyaloid artery and its related vasculature begin to atrophy and completely disappear by birth.  In the postnatal eye, Cloquet's canal marks the former location of the hyaloid artery.\nChannels regulate lens transport.\nAfter regression of the hyaloid artery, the lens receives all its nourishment from the aqueous humor. Nutrients diffuse in and waste diffuses out through a constant flow of fluid from the anterior/posterior poles of the lens and out of the equatorial regions, a dynamic that is maintained by the Na/K-ATPase pumps located in the equatorially positioned cells of the lens epithelium. The interaction of these pumps with water channels into cells called aquaporins, molecules less than 100 daltons in size among cells via gap junctions, and calcium using transporters/regulators (TRPV channels) results in a flow of nutrients throughout the lens.\nGlucose is the primary energy source for the lens. As mature lens fibers do not have mitochondria, approximately 80% of the glucose is metabolized via anaerobic metabolism.  The remaining fraction of glucose is shunted primarily down the pentose phosphate pathway. The lack of aerobic respiration means that the lens consumes very little oxygen.\n\nClinical significance[edit]\nCataracts are opacities of the lens. While some are small and do not require any treatment, others may be large enough to block light and obstruct vision. Cataracts usually develop as the aging lens becomes more and more opaque, but cataracts can also form congenitally or after injury to the lens. Nuclear sclerosis is a type of age-related cataract. Diabetes is another risk factor for cataract. Cataract surgery involves the removal of the lens and insertion of an artificial intraocular lens.\nPresbyopia is the age-related loss of accommodation, which is marked by the inability of the eye to focus on nearby objects. The exact mechanism is still unknown, but age-related changes in the hardness, shape, and size of the lens have all been linked to the condition.\nEctopia lentis is the displacement of the lens from its normal position.\nAphakia is the absence of the lens from the eye. Aphakia can be the result of surgery or injury, or it can be congenital.\n\nAdditional images[edit]\nMRI scan of human eye showing lens.\n\n\n\nInterior of anterior chamber of eye.\n\n\n\nThe crystalline lens, hardened and divided.\n\n\n\nSection through the margin of the lens, showing the transition of the epithelium into the lens fibers known as the bow region.\n\n\n\nThe structures of the eye labeled\n\n\n\nAnother view of the eye and the structures of the eye labeled\n\n\n\nThis svg file was configured so that the rays, diaphragm and crystalline lens are easily modified\n\nSee also[edit]\nMedical portal\nAccommodation reflex\nCrystallin\nEvolution of the eye, for how the lens evolved\nIntraocular lenses\nIris\nLens capsule\nPhacoemulsification\nVisual perception\nZonules of Zinn"

    "content": "A nostril (or naris /\u02c8n\u025b\u0259r\u026as/, pl.: nares /\u02c8n\u025b\u0259ri\u02d0z/) is either of the two orifices of the nose. They enable the entry and exit of air and other gasses through the nasal cavities.  In birds and mammals, they contain branched bones or cartilages called turbinates, whose function is to warm air on inhalation and remove moisture on exhalation. Fish do not breathe through noses, but they do have two small holes used for smelling, which can also be referred to as nostrils (with the exception of Cyclostomi, which have just one nostril).\nIn humans, the nasal cycle is the normal ultradian cycle of each nostril's blood vessels becoming engorged in swelling, then shrinking.\nThe nostrils are separated by the septum. The septum can sometimes be deviated, causing one nostril to appear larger than the other.  With extreme damage to the septum and columella, the two nostrils are no longer separated and form a single larger external opening.\nLike other tetrapods, humans have two external nostrils (anterior nares) and two additional nostrils at the back of the nasal cavity, inside the head (posterior nares, posterior nasal apertures or choanae). They also connect the nose to the throat (the nasopharynx), aiding in respiration. Though all four nostrils were on the outside the head of the aquatic ancestors of modern tetrapods, the nostrils for outgoing water (excurrent nostrils) migrated to the inside of the mouth, as evidenced by the discovery of Kenichthys campbelli, a 395-million-year-old fossilized fish which shows this migration in progress. It has two nostrils between its front teeth, similar to human embryos at an early stage. If these fail to join up, the result is a cleft palate.\nEach external nostril contains approximately 1,000 strands of nasal hair, which function to filter foreign particles such as pollen and dust.\nIt is possible for humans to smell different olfactory inputs in the two nostrils and experience a perceptual rivalry akin to that of binocular rivalry when there are two different inputs to the two eyes. Furthermore, scent information from the two nostrils leads to two types of neural activity with the first cycle corresponding to the ipsilateral and the second cycle corresponding to the contralateral odor representations.\nThe Procellariiformes are distinguished from other birds by having tubular extensions of their nostrils.\nWidely-spaced nostrils, like those of the hammerhead shark, may be useful in determining the direction of an odour's source.\n\nSee also[edit]\nDilator naris muscle\nNasal cycle"

Cold Showers Health Benefits | The Ultimate Guide! \n\n.Mike Rosa  Anabolic Aliens  Sep 29, 2020\n\nShare\n\n  *   *   *   * \n\nSome people take steaming hot showers but other people swear by the magical\nhealing properties of ice cold showers. No matter how you like to shower,\nthere are proven health benefits to both.\n\nToday we\u2019re going to go over the different health benefits of both hot and\ncold showers!\n\n##  M  uscle Effects\n\n###  H  ot Showers\n\nLet\u2019s start off with the effects on our muscles. Hot showers are great for\nrelieving tension. So if your muscles are really sore or tight, hot showers\nhelp relax that tightness and alleviate pain and discomfort, just like the\njets of a jacuzzi.\n\nIn fact, if you know you have an intense workout later in the day and you wake\nup super stiff, a hot shower in the morning is a great way to help loosen up\nand rid yourself of those stubborn knots.\n\nAlso, hot showers can help reduce joint inflammation, which can improve your\nmobility. Overall, if you are experiencing any form of tightness, pain, or\ndiscomfort, go take a hot shower.\n\n##  C  old Showers\n\nCold water can actually help speed up muscle recovery. So taking a cold shower\nright after a workout is a great idea. It\u2019s been proven that cold showers\nenhance muscle repair and recovery, which reduces delayed onset muscle\nsoreness.\n\nCold showers act like an ice pack\u2014 they reduce muscular swelling or\ninflammation. When we workout and break down those muscle fibers, they swell,\nand the coldness of the shower helps reduce that swelling, which speeds up the\nrepair of the new muscle fibers for an overall quicker recovery.\n\nIn general, hot showers can be viewed as a pre-workout tension reliever and\ncold showers like a post-workout recovery.\n\nIf you\u2019re not used to cold showers, you may have to build a little tolerance\ntoward them by cycling between hot and cold. The hot shower will open the\nblood vessels then switching to cold increases circulation by the blood\nrushing toward the organs.\n\nThis method will also help remove some of the lactic acid built up from\nexercise. However, if you use the cycling method, it is important to end with\nthe cold shower.  \u200d\n\n###  S  kin/Hair Effects\n\n####  C  old Showers\n\nCold water hydrates the skin. So if you\u2019re someone experiencing discomfort\nfrom dry skin, a cold shower is a great fix. The more hydrated the skin, the\nhealthier it will be.\n\nAlso, cold showers will help close skin pores, which protects against dirt,\nunnatural oils, germs and other debris getting in them. The combination of the\nhydration and the pores getting closed is a solid method of preventing\nblackheads as well as other forms of acne. Overall, cold showers significantly\nstrengthen and protect our skin cells.\n\nThis process is also extremely beneficial for hair health, keeping your hair\nstronger, shinier and overall healthier. Cold showers can prevent the loss of\nnatural hair oils, helping with split ends as well as increasing follicle grip\nto the scalp. This can help prevent hair loss, especially for men with\nreceding hairlines.\n\n####  H  ot Showers\n\nHot showers help cleanse the skin like an exfoliator. The steam from the hot\nwater does the opposite of cold showers and opens up the pores, which can\nrejuvenate the skin. This cleanse can help get rid of dead skin, dirt, and\nunnatural oils that have built up, which can help eliminate pimples and acne.\n\nRegarding the hair, hot water helps rejuvenate nerve endings for a fuller,\nhealthier look. Now on the contrary, hot showers can lead directly to dry\nskin. If you\u2019re someone who takes long hot showers to relax, you\u2019re actually\nhurting your skin and hair health.\n\nIf you like your hot showers, the best method to get the best benefits would\nbe to start with the hot shower for the exfoliating and rejuvenating effects\nand end with the cold shower for the hydration and skin cell protection.\n\n###  I  mmune System/Body Effects\n\n####  H  ot Showers\n\nHot showers are well known for their decongestant effects. The steam from the\nhot water relaxes and opens up the nasal passages, allowing the sinuses to\ndrain out and unclog as well as loosen up phlegm.\n\nThis is a great way to help eliminate sinus pressure, overall congestion, and\ncoughing, thus relieving cold symptoms. Also, the steam from hot water opens\nup the lungs for better overall air flow, which can significantly help those\nwho suffer from asthma to breathe easier.\n\nIf you are someone who suffers from migraines, hot water opens up the blood\nvessels. Considering most headaches are caused by decreased blood flow, hot\nwater can help bring blood to your head and ease your pain.\n\nAnother property of hot water is that it makes your body sweat which helps rid\nitself of bad toxins. Also, the heat destroys germs and bacteria, which is a\ngreat method to prevent sickness.  \n  \n\nOne last benefit of hot showers is they can actually help with healing. If you\nhave a small wound that\u2019s open, the hot water can enhance blood circulation to\nthat specific area expediting the healing process.\n\n####  C  old Showers\n\nCold showers have been proven to strengthen the immune system. Exposure to\ncold water results in increased lymphatic movement, ridding the body of large\namounts of waste.\n\nThis can prevent infection, increase testosterone and even sperm cell count,\nclear blocked arteries, decrease blood pressure, increase the amount of white\nblood cells fighting against disease and improve heart health by the promotion\nof more efficient blood circulation.\n\nTherefore, if you\u2019re healthy, cold showers are for you. If you\u2019re sick or\nexperiencing any symptoms of sickness, a hot shower may be more beneficial to\nyou.\n\n###  M  ental Health Effects\n\n####  C  old Showers\n\nIf you\u2019re someone who has a hard time waking up in the morning, take a cold\nshower. It is proven that cold showers significantly increase mental alertness\nand even reduce body fatigue. One fascinating effect of cold showers is they\nmay relieve depression.\n\nEssentially, the shock of the cold water sends an electrical impulse to the\nbrain, igniting the serotonin neurotransmitter as well as releasing\nnoradrenalin, which regulates mood and alleviates depression.\n\nIt\u2019s also been proven that cold showers increase willpower and resilience,\nwhich positively affects the nervous system and can reduce stress. Along with\nthat, cold showers result in an increase in uric acid and blood glutathione\nwhich lowers stress levels.\n\nThis reduced stress can also treat insomnia. Taking a cold shower before bed\nhas been proven to aid in deeper sleep by lowering body temperature. Also,\ncold showers have been shown to enhance deeper and slower breathing to control\nstress levels.\n\n####  H  ot Showers\n\nOn the other hand, hot showers have been shown to stimulate the brain to\nrelease more oxytocin which significantly eases anxiety and can reduce stress\nas well. Hot showers have also been proven to act as a sedative to help induce\nsleep. The tension relief from hot showers results in a more optimal calming\neffect for the mind and body.\n\n###  W  eight Effects\n\n####  Hot Showers\n\nHot showers have been shown to increase the body\u2019s metabolism. A boost in\nmetabolism helps promote weight loss.\n\n####  C  old Showers\n\nCold showers have also been shown to increase metabolism due to the body\u2019s\nshock effect. However, cold showers can actually promote  fat  loss.\n\nThere are two types of fat in the body: brown fat and white fat. Brown fat is\nthe healthy fat that our bodies need for warmth. White fat is the stubborn fat\nthat is stored when we consume more calories than we burn.\n\nBrown fat is actually more optimally activated by cold showers. This increases\ncalories burned, which keeps your body warm and promotes the loss of white\nfat.\n\n###  The Bottom Line\n\nIn conclusion, hot and cold showers both have their health benefits. Overall,\ncold showers are more than likely the way to go if you are to choose just one.\n\nIf you want to get benefits from both hot and cold showers, try a method of\nstarting with 3 minutes of hot shower and end with 5 minutes of cold shower.\nYou can also do the alternating back and forth method while ending with a cold\nshower.\n\nLastly, there is no need to shower for a long period of time. Save some water\nand keep your showers to under 10 minutes!\n\n###  J  oin the Invasion!\n\nThis Anabolic Aliens membership will grant you access to workout classes,\nrehab programs, diet plans, and more exclusive content to help you achieve\nsustainable success!\n\nTags:  .mike rosa  ,  Exercises & fitness tips\n\nShare\n\n  *   *   *   * \n\nPrevious article  Next article\n\nBlog Categories\n\n  * Workouts \n  * Exercises & Fitness Tips \n  * Nutrition \n\nPopular posts\n\n  1.

    "content": "\nHumans (Homo sapiens) or modern humans  are the most common and widespread species of primate, and the last surviving species of the genus Homo. They are great apes characterized by their hairlessness, bipedalism, and high intelligence. Humans have large brains, enabling more advanced cognitive skills that enable them to thrive and adapt in varied environments, develop highly complex tools, and form complex social structures and civilizations. Humans are highly social, with individual humans tending to belong to a multi-layered network of cooperating, distinct, or even competing social groups \u2013 from families and peer groups to corporations and political states. As such, social interactions between humans have established a wide variety of values, social norms, languages, and traditions (collectively termed institutions), each of which bolsters human society. Humans are also highly curious: the desire to understand and influence phenomena has motivated humanity's development of science, technology, philosophy, mythology, religion, and other frameworks of knowledge; humans also study themselves through such domains as anthropology, social science, history, psychology, and medicine. As of March 2024, there are estimated to be more than 8 billion humans alive.\nAlthough some scientists equate the term \"humans\" with all members of the genus Homo, in common usage it generally refers to Homo sapiens, the only extant member. Extinct members of the genus Homo are known as archaic humans, and the term \"modern human\" is used to distinguish Homo sapiens from archaic humans. Anatomically modern humans emerged around 300,000 years ago in Africa, evolving from Homo heidelbergensis or a similar species. Migrating out of Africa, they gradually replaced and interbred with local populations of archaic humans. Multiple hypotheses for the extinction of archaic human species such as Neanderthals include competition, violence, interbreeding with Homo sapiens, or inability to adapt to climate change.\nFor most of their history, humans were nomadic hunter-gatherers. Humans began exhibiting behavioral modernity about 160,000\u201360,000 years ago. The Neolithic Revolution, which began in Southwest Asia around 13,000 years ago (and separately in a few other places), saw the emergence of agriculture and permanent human settlement; in turn, this led to the development of civilization and kickstarted a period of continuous (and ongoing) population growth and rapid technological change. Since then, a number of civilizations have risen and fallen, while a number of sociocultural and technological developments have resulted in significant changes to the human lifestyle.\nGenes and the environment influence human biological variation in visible characteristics, physiology, disease susceptibility, mental abilities, body size, and life span. Though humans vary in many traits (such as genetic predispositions and physical features), humans are among the least genetically diverse primates. Any two humans are at least 99% genetically similar. Humans are sexually dimorphic: generally, males have greater body strength and females have a higher body fat percentage. At puberty, humans develop secondary sex characteristics. Females are capable of pregnancy, usually between puberty, at around 12 years old, and menopause, around the age of 50.\nHumans are omnivorous, capable of consuming a wide variety of plant and animal material, and have used fire and other forms of heat to prepare and cook food since the time of Homo erectus. Humans can survive for up to eight weeks without food and several days without water. Humans are generally diurnal, sleeping on average seven to nine hours per day. Childbirth is dangerous, with a high risk of complications and death. Often, both the mother and the father provide care for their children, who are helpless at birth.\nHumans have a large, highly developed, and complex prefrontal cortex, the region of the brain associated with higher cognition. Humans are highly intelligent and capable of episodic memory; they have flexible facial expressions, self-awareness, and a theory of mind. The human mind is capable of introspection, private thought, imagination, volition, and forming views on existence. This has allowed great technological advancements and complex tool development through complex reasoning and the transmission of knowledge to subsequent generations through language.\nHumans' advanced technology has enabled them to spread to all the continents of the globe as well as to outer space, and to command profound influence on the biosphere and environment. The latter has prompted some geologists to demarcate the time from the emergence of human civilization till present as a separate geological epoch: the Anthropocene (with anthropo- deriving from the Ancient Greek word for \"human\", \u1f04\u03bd\u03b8\u03c1\u03c9\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2).\n\nEtymology and definition\n\nFurther information: Names for the human species and Human taxonomy\nCarl Linnaeus coined the name Homo sapiens and is the type specimen of the species\nAll modern humans are classified into the species Homo sapiens, coined by Carl Linnaeus in his 1735 work Systema Naturae. The generic name \"Homo\" is a learned 18th-century derivation from Latin hom\u014d, which refers to humans of either sex. The word human can refer to all members of the Homo genus, although in common usage it generally just refers to Homo sapiens, the only extant species. The name \"Homo sapiens\" means 'wise man' or 'knowledgeable man'. There is disagreement if certain extinct members of the genus, namely Neanderthals, should be included as a separate species of humans or as a subspecies of H. sapiens.\nHuman is a loanword of Middle English from Old French humain, ultimately from Latin h\u016bm\u0101nus, the adjectival form of hom\u014d ('man' \u2013 in the sense of humanity). The native English term man can refer to the species generally (a synonym for humanity) as well as to human males. It may also refer to individuals of either sex.\nDespite the fact that the word animal is colloquially used as an antonym for human, and contrary to a common biological misconception, humans are animals. The word person is often used interchangeably with human, but philosophical debate exists as to whether personhood applies to all humans or all sentient beings, and further if one can lose personhood (such as by going into a persistent vegetative state).\n\nEvolution\n\nMain article: Human evolution\nHumans are apes (superfamily Hominoidea). The lineage of apes that eventually gave rise to humans first split from gibbons (family Hylobatidae) and orangutans (genus Pongo), then gorillas (genus Gorilla), and finally, chimpanzees and bonobos (genus Pan). The last split, between the human and chimpanzee\u2013bonobo lineages, took place around 8\u20134 million years ago, in the late Miocene epoch. During this split, chromosome 2 was formed from the joining of two other chromosomes, leaving humans with only 23 pairs of chromosomes, compared to 24 for the other apes. Following their split with chimpanzees and bonobos, the hominins diversified into many species and at least two distinct genera. All but one of these lineages\u00a0\u2013 representing the genus Homo and its sole extant species Homo sapiens\u00a0\u2013 are now extinct.\nReconstruction of Lucy, the first Australopithecus afarensis skeleton found\nThe genus Homo evolved from Australopithecus. Though fossils from the transition are scarce, the earliest members of Homo share several key traits with Australopithecus. The earliest record of Homo is the 2.8 million-year-old specimen LD 350-1 from Ethiopia, and the earliest named species are Homo habilis and Homo rudolfensis which evolved by 2.3 million years ago. H. erectus (the African variant is sometimes called H. ergaster) evolved 2 million years ago and was the first archaic human species to leave Africa and disperse across Eurasia. H. erectus also was the first to evolve a characteristically human body plan. Homo sapiens emerged in Africa around 300,000 years ago from a species commonly designated as either H. heidelbergensis or H. rhodesiensis, the descendants of H. erectus that remained in Africa. H. sapiens migrated out of the continent, gradually replacing or interbreeding with local populations of archaic humans. Humans began exhibiting behavioral modernity about 160,000\u201370,000 years ago, and possibly earlier.\nThe \"out of Africa\" migration took place in at least two waves, the first around 130,000 to 100,000 years ago, the second (Southern Dispersal) around 70,000 to 50,000 years ago. H. sapiens proceeded to colonize all the continents and larger islands, arriving in Eurasia 125,000 years ago, Australia around 65,000 years ago, the Americas around 15,000 years ago, and remote islands such as Hawaii, Easter Island, Madagascar, and New Zealand in the years 300 to 1280 CE.\nHuman evolution was not a simple linear or branched progression but involved interbreeding between related species. Genomic research has shown that hybridization between substantially diverged lineages was common in human evolution. DNA evidence suggests that several genes of Neanderthal origin are present among all non sub-Saharan-African populations, and Neanderthals and other hominins, such as Denisovans, may have contributed up to 6% of their genome to present-day non sub-Saharan-African humans.\nHuman evolution is characterized by a number of morphological, developmental, physiological, and behavioral changes that have taken place since the split between the last common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees. The most significant of these adaptations are hairlessness, obligate bipedalism, increased brain size and decreased sexual dimorphism (neoteny). The relationship between all these changes is the subject of ongoing debate.\nHominoidea\u00a0(hominoids,\u00a0apes)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHylobatidae (gibbons)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHominidae\u00a0(hominids,\u00a0great\u00a0apes)\n\n\n\n\n\nPonginae\n\n\n\n\n\nPongo\u00a0(orangutans)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPongo abelii\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPongo tapanuliensis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPongo pygmaeus\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHomininae\u00a0(hominines)\n\n\n\n\n\nGorillini\n\n\n\n\n\nGorilla\u00a0(gorillas)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGorilla gorilla\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGorilla beringei\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHominini\u00a0(hominins)\n\n\n\n\n\nPanina\n\n\n\n\n\nPan\u00a0(chimpanzees)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPan troglodytes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPan paniscus\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHominina\u00a0(homininans)\n\n\nHomo sapiens (humans)\n\nHistory\n\nMain article: Human history\nPrehistory\n\nMain article: Prehistory\nOverview map of the peopling of the world by early human migration during the Upper Paleolithic, following to the Southern Dispersal paradigm\nUntil about 12,000 years ago, all humans lived as hunter-gatherers. The Neolithic Revolution (the invention of agriculture) first took place in Southwest Asia and spread through large parts of the Old World over the following millennia. It also occurred independently in Mesoamerica (about 6,000 years ago), China, Papua New Guinea, and the Sahel and West Savanna regions of Africa.\nAccess to food surplus led to the formation of permanent human settlements, the domestication of animals and the use of metal tools for the first time in history. Agriculture and sedentary lifestyle led to the emergence of early civilizations.\nAncient\n\nMain article: Ancient history\nGreat Pyramids of Giza, Egypt\nAn urban revolution took place in the 4th millennium BCE with the development of city-states, particularly Sumerian cities located in Mesopotamia. It was in these cities that the earliest known form of writing, cuneiform script, appeared around 3000 BCE. Other major civilizations to develop around this time were Ancient Egypt and the Indus Valley Civilisation. They eventually traded with each other and invented technology such as wheels, plows and sails. Astronomy and mathematics were also developed and the Great Pyramid of Giza was built. There is evidence of a severe drought lasting about a hundred years that may have caused the decline of these civilizations, with new ones appearing in the aftermath. Babylonians came to dominate Mesopotamia while others, such as the Poverty Point culture, Minoans and the Shang dynasty, rose to prominence in new areas.\nThe Late Bronze Age collapse around 1200 BCE resulted in the disappearance of a number of civilizations and the beginning of the Greek Dark Ages. During this period iron started replacing bronze, leading to the Iron Age.\nIn the 5th century BCE, history started being recorded as a discipline, which provided a much clearer picture of life at the time. Between the 8th and 6th century BCE, Europe entered the classical antiquity age, a period when ancient Greece and ancient Rome flourished. Around this time other civilizations also came to prominence. The Maya civilization started to build cities and create complex calendars. In Africa, the Kingdom of Aksum overtook the declining Kingdom of Kush and facilitated trade between India and the Mediterranean. In West Asia, the Achaemenid Empire's system of centralized governance became the precursor to many later empires, while the Gupta Empire in India and the Han dynasty in China have been described as golden ages in their respective regions.\nMedieval\n\nMain article: Post-classical history\nMedieval French manuscript illustration of the three classes of medieval society from the 13th-century Li Livres dou Sant\u00e9\nFollowing the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476, Europe entered the Middle Ages. During this period, Christianity and the Church would provide centralized authority and education. In the Middle East, Islam became the prominent religion and expanded into North Africa. It led to an Islamic Golden Age, inspiring achievements in architecture, the revival of old advances in science and technology, and the formation of a distinct way of life. The Christian and Islamic worlds would eventually clash, with the Kingdom of England, the Kingdom of France and the Holy Roman Empire declaring a series of holy wars to regain control of the Holy Land from Muslims.\nIn the Americas, complex Mississippian societies would arise starting around 800 CE, while further south, the Aztecs and Incas would become the dominant powers. The Mongol Empire would conquer much of Eurasia in the 13th and 14th centuries. Over this same time period, the Mali Empire in Africa grew to be the largest empire on the continent, stretching from Senegambia to Ivory Coast. Oceania would see the rise of the Tu\u02bbi Tonga Empire which expanded across many islands in the South Pacific.\nModern\n\nMain articles: Early modern period and Late modern period\nJames Watt's steam engine\nThe early modern period in Europe and the Near East (c.\u20091450\u20131800) began with the final defeat of the Byzantine Empire, and the rise of the Ottoman Empire. Meanwhile, Japan entered the Edo period, the Qing dynasty rose in China and the Mughal Empire ruled much of India. Europe underwent the Renaissance, starting in the 15th century, and the Age of Discovery began with the exploring and colonizing of new regions. This includes the British Empire expanding to become the world's largest empire and the colonization of the Americas. This expansion led to the Atlantic slave trade and the genocide of Native American peoples. This period also marked the Scientific Revolution, with great advances in mathematics, mechanics, astronomy and physiology.\nThe late modern period (1800\u2013present) saw the Technological and Industrial Revolution bring such discoveries as imaging technology, major innovations in transport and energy development. The United States of America underwent great change, going from a small group of colonies to one of the global superpowers. The Napoleonic Wars raged through Europe in the early 1800s, Spain lost most of its colonies in the New World, while Europeans continued expansion into Africa\u00a0\u2013 where European control went from 10% to almost 90% in less than 50 years\u00a0\u2013 and Oceania.\nA tenuous balance of power among European nations collapsed in 1914 with the outbreak of the First World War, one of the deadliest conflicts in history. In the 1930s, a worldwide economic crisis led to the rise of authoritarian regimes and a Second World War, involving almost all of the world's countries. The war's destruction led to the collapse of most global empires, leading to widespread decolonization.\nContemporary\n\nMain article: Contemporary history\nFollowing the conclusion of the Second World War in 1945, the Cold War between the USSR and the United States saw a struggle for global influence, including a nuclear arms race and a space race, ending in the collapse of the Soviet Union. The current Information Age, spurred by the development of the Internet and Artificial Intelligence systems, sees the world becoming increasingly globalized and interconnected.\n\nHabitat and population\n\nFurther information: Human geography and Demography\nPopulation statisticsMosaic cartogram showing the distribution of the global population based on 2018 UN data.

Modern humans, however, have a great capacity for altering their habitats by means of technology, irrigation, urban planning, construction, deforestation and desertification. Human settlements continue to be vulnerable to natural disasters, especially those placed in hazardous locations and with low quality of construction. Grouping and deliberate habitat alteration is often done with the goals of providing protection, accumulating comforts or material wealth, expanding the available food, improving aesthetics, increasing knowledge or enhancing the exchange of resources.\nHumans are one of the most adaptable species, despite having a low or narrow tolerance for many of the earth's extreme environments. Currently the species is present in all eight biogeographical realms, although their presence in the Antarctic realm is very limited to research stations and annually there is a population decline in the winter months of this realm. Humans established their nation-states in the other seven realms, such as for example South Africa, India, Russia, Australia, Fiji, United States and Brazil (each located in a different biogeographical realm).\nBy using advanced tools and clothing, humans have been able to extend their tolerance to a wide variety of temperatures, humidities, and altitudes. As a result, humans are a cosmopolitan species found in almost all regions of the world, including tropical rainforest, arid desert, extremely cold arctic regions, and heavily polluted cities; in comparison, most other species are confined to a few geographical areas by their limited adaptability. The human population is not, however, uniformly distributed on the Earth's surface, because the population density varies from one region to another, and large stretches of surface are almost completely uninhabited, like Antarctica and vast swathes of the ocean. Most humans (61%) live in Asia; the remainder live in the Americas (14%), Africa (14%), Europe (11%), and Oceania (0.5%).\nWithin the last century, humans have explored challenging environments such as Antarctica, the deep sea, and outer space. Human habitation within these hostile environments is restrictive and expensive, typically limited in duration, and restricted to scientific, military, or industrial expeditions. Humans have briefly visited the Moon and made their presence felt on other celestial bodies through human-made robotic spacecraft. Since the early 20th century, there has been continuous human presence in Antarctica through research stations and, since 2000, in space through habitation on the International Space Station.\nHumans and their domesticated animals represent 96% of all mammalian biomass on earth, whereas all wild mammals represent only 4%.\nEstimates of the population at the time agriculture emerged in around 10,000 BC have ranged between 1 million and 15 million. Around 50\u201360 million people lived in the combined eastern and western Roman Empire in the 4th century AD. Bubonic plagues, first recorded in the 6th century AD, reduced the population by 50%, with the Black Death killing 75\u2013200 million people in Eurasia and North Africa alone. Human population is believed to have reached one billion in 1800. It has since then increased exponentially, reaching two billion in 1930 and three billion in 1960, four in 1975, five in 1987 and six billion in 1999. It passed seven billion in 2011 and passed eight billion in November 2022. It took over two million years of human prehistory and history for the human population to reach one billion and only 207 years more to grow to 7 billion. The combined biomass of the carbon of all the humans on Earth in 2018 was estimated at 60 million tons, about 10 times larger than that of all non-domesticated mammals.\nIn 2018, 4.2 billion humans (55%) lived in urban areas, up from 751 million in 1950. The most urbanized regions are Northern America (82%), Latin America (81%), Europe (74%) and Oceania (68%), with Africa and Asia having nearly 90% of the world's 3.4 billion rural population. Problems for humans living in cities include various forms of pollution and crime, especially in inner city and suburban slums. Humans have had a dramatic effect on the environment. They are apex predators, being rarely preyed upon by other species. Human population growth, industrialization, land development, overconsumption and combustion of fossil fuels have led to environmental destruction and pollution that significantly contributes to the ongoing mass extinction of other forms of life.\n\nBiology\nAnatomy and physiology\n\nMain article: Human body\nDiagram of the human skeleton\nMost aspects of human physiology are closely homologous to corresponding aspects of animal physiology. The dental formula of humans is: 2.1.2.32.1.2.3. Humans have proportionately shorter palates and much smaller teeth than other primates. They are the only primates to have short, relatively flush canine teeth. Humans have characteristically crowded teeth, with gaps from lost teeth usually closing up quickly in young individuals. Humans are gradually losing their third molars, with some individuals having them congenitally absent.\nHumans share with chimpanzees a vestigial tail, appendix, flexible shoulder joints, grasping fingers and opposable thumbs. Humans also have a more barrel-shaped chests in contrast to the funnel shape of other apes, an adaptation for bipedal respiration. Apart from bipedalism and brain size, humans differ from chimpanzees mostly in smelling, hearing and digesting proteins. While humans have a density of hair follicles comparable to other apes, it is predominantly vellus hair, most of which is so short and wispy as to be practically invisible. Humans have about 2 million sweat glands spread over their entire bodies, many more than chimpanzees, whose sweat glands are scarce and are mainly located on the palm of the hand and on the soles of the feet.\nIt is estimated that the worldwide average height for an adult human male is about 171\u00a0cm (5\u00a0ft 7\u00a0in), while the worldwide average height for adult human females is about 159\u00a0cm (5\u00a0ft 3\u00a0in). Shrinkage of stature may begin in middle age in some individuals but tends to be typical in the extremely aged. Throughout history, human populations have universally become taller, probably as a consequence of better nutrition, healthcare, and living conditions. The average mass of an adult human is 59\u00a0kg (130\u00a0lb) for females and 77\u00a0kg (170\u00a0lb) for males. Like many other conditions, body weight and body type are influenced by both genetic susceptibility and environment and varies greatly among individuals.\nHumans have a far faster and more accurate throw than other animals. Humans are also among the best long-distance runners in the animal kingdom, but slower over short distances. Humans' thinner body hair and more productive sweat glands help avoid heat exhaustion while running for long distances. Compared to other apes, the human heart produces greater stroke volume and cardiac output and the aorta is proportionately larger.\nGenetics\n\nMain article: Human genetics\nA graphical representation of the standard human karyotype, including both the female (XX) and male (XY) sex chromosomes (bottom right), as well as the mitochondrial genome (shown to scale as \"MT\" at bottom left). Further information: Karyotype\nLike most animals, humans are a diploid and eukaryotic species. Each somatic cell has two sets of 23 chromosomes, each set received from one parent; gametes have only one set of chromosomes, which is a mixture of the two parental sets. Among the 23 pairs of chromosomes, there are 22 pairs of autosomes and one pair of sex chromosomes. Like other mammals, humans have an XY sex-determination system, so that females have the sex chromosomes XX and males have XY. Genes and environment influence human biological variation in visible characteristics, physiology, disease susceptibility and mental abilities. The exact influence of genes and environment on certain traits is not well understood.\nWhile no humans\u00a0\u2013 not even monozygotic twins\u00a0\u2013 are genetically identical, two humans on average will have a genetic similarity of 99.5%-99.9%. This makes them more homogeneous than other great apes, including chimpanzees. This small variation in human DNA compared to many other species suggests a population bottleneck during the Late Pleistocene (around 100,000 years ago), in which the human population was reduced to a small number of breeding pairs. The forces of natural selection have continued to operate on human populations, with evidence that certain regions of the genome display directional selection in the past 15,000 years.\nThe human genome was first sequenced in 2001 and by 2020 hundreds of thousands of genomes had been sequenced. In 2012 the International HapMap Project had compared the genomes of 1,184 individuals from 11 populations and identified 1.6 million single nucleotide polymorphisms. African populations harbor the highest number of private genetic variants. While many of the common variants found in populations outside of Africa are also found on the African continent, there are still large numbers that are private to these regions, especially Oceania and the Americas. By 2010 estimates, humans have approximately 22,000 genes. By comparing mitochondrial DNA, which is inherited only from the mother, geneticists have concluded that the last female common ancestor whose genetic marker is found in all modern humans, the so-called mitochondrial Eve, must have lived around 90,000 to 200,000 years ago.\nLife cycle\n\nSee also: Childbirth and Life expectancy\nA 10\u00a0mm human embryo at 5 weeks\nMost human reproduction takes place by internal fertilization via sexual intercourse, but can also occur through assisted reproductive technology procedures. The average gestation period is 38 weeks, but a normal pregnancy can vary by up to 37 days. Embryonic development in the human covers the first eight weeks of development; at the beginning of the ninth week the embryo is termed a fetus. Humans are able to induce early labor or perform a caesarean section if the child needs to be born earlier for medical reasons. In developed countries, infants are typically 3\u20134\u00a0kg (7\u20139\u00a0lb) in weight and 47\u201353\u00a0cm (19\u201321\u00a0in) in height at birth. However, low birth weight is common in developing countries, and contributes to the high levels of infant mortality in these regions.\nCompared with other species, human childbirth is dangerous, with a much higher risk of complications and death. The size of the fetus's head is more closely matched to the pelvis than in other primates. The reason for this is not completely understood, but it contributes to a painful labor that can last 24 hours or more. The chances of a successful labor increased significantly during the 20th century in wealthier countries with the advent of new medical technologies. In contrast, pregnancy and natural childbirth remain hazardous ordeals in developing regions of the world, with maternal death rates approximately 100 times greater than in developed countries.\nBoth the mother and the father provide care for human offspring, in contrast to other primates, where parental care is mostly done by the mother. Helpless at birth, humans continue to grow for some years, typically reaching sexual maturity at 15 to 17 years of age. The human life span has been split into various stages ranging from three to twelve. Common stages include infancy, childhood, adolescence, adulthood and old age. The lengths of these stages have varied across cultures and time periods but is typified by an unusually rapid growth spurt during adolescence. Human females undergo menopause and become infertile at around the age of 50. It has been proposed that menopause increases a woman's overall reproductive success by allowing her to invest more time and resources in her existing offspring, and in turn their children (the grandmother hypothesis), rather than by continuing to bear children into old age.\nThe life span of an individual depends on two major factors, genetics and lifestyle choices. For various reasons, including biological/genetic causes, women live on average about four years longer than men. As of 2018, the global average life expectancy at birth of a girl is estimated to be 74.9 years compared to 70.4 for a boy. There are significant geographical variations in human life expectancy, mostly correlated with economic development\u00a0\u2013 for example, life expectancy at birth in Hong Kong is 87.6\u00a0years for girls and 81.8 for boys, while in the Central African Republic, it is 55.0\u00a0years for girls and 50.6 for boys. The developed world is generally aging, with the median age around 40 years. In the developing world, the median age is between 15 and 20 years. While one in five Europeans is 60 years of age or older, only one in twenty Africans is 60 years of age or older. In 2012, the United Nations estimated that there were 316,600 living centenarians (humans of age 100 or older) worldwide.\nHuman life stages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInfant boy and girl\n\nBoy and girl before puberty (children)\n\nAdolescent male and female\n\nAdult man and woman\n\nElderly man and woman\nDiet\n\nMain article: Human nutrition\nHumans living in Bali, Indonesia, preparing a meal\nHumans are omnivorous, capable of consuming a wide variety of plant and animal material. Human groups have adopted a range of diets from purely vegan to primarily carnivorous. In some cases, dietary restrictions in humans can lead to deficiency diseases; however, stable human groups have adapted to many dietary patterns through both genetic specialization and cultural conventions to use nutritionally balanced food sources. The human diet is prominently reflected in human culture and has led to the development of food science.\nUntil the development of agriculture, Homo sapiens employed a hunter-gatherer method as their sole means of food collection. This involved combining stationary food sources (such as fruits, grains, tubers, and mushrooms, insect larvae and aquatic mollusks) with wild game, which must be hunted and captured in order to be consumed. It has been proposed that humans have used fire to prepare and cook food since the time of Homo erectus. Human domestication of wild plants began about 11,700 years ago, leading to the development of agriculture, a gradual process called the Neolithic Revolution. These dietary changes may also have altered human biology; the spread of dairy farming provided a new and rich source of food, leading to the evolution of the ability to digest lactose in some adults. The types of food consumed, and how they are prepared, have varied widely by time, location, and culture.\nIn general, humans can survive for up to eight weeks without food, depending on stored body fat. Survival without water is usually limited to three or four days, with a maximum of one week. In 2020 it is estimated 9 million humans die every year from causes directly or indirectly related to starvation. Childhood malnutrition is also common and contributes to the global burden of disease. However, global food distribution is not even, and obesity among some human populations has increased rapidly, leading to health complications and increased mortality in some developed and a few developing countries. Worldwide, over one billion people are obese, while in the United States 35% of people are obese, leading to this being described as an \"obesity epidemic.\" Obesity is caused by consuming more calories than are expended, so excessive weight gain is usually caused by an energy-dense diet.\nBiological variation\n\nMain article: Human genetic variation\nChanges in the number and order of genes (A\u2013D) create genetic diversity within and between population.\nThere is biological variation in the human species\u00a0\u2013 with traits such as blood type, genetic diseases, cranial features, facial features, organ systems, eye color, hair color and texture, height and build, and skin color varying across the globe. The typical height of an adult human is between 1.4 and 1.9\u00a0m (4\u00a0ft 7\u00a0in and 6\u00a0ft 3\u00a0in), although this varies significantly depending on sex, ethnic origin, and family bloodlines. Body size is partly determined by genes and is also significantly influenced by environmental factors such as diet, exercise, and sleep patterns.\nThere is evidence that populations have adapted genetically to various external factors. The genes that allow adult humans to digest lactose are present in high frequencies in populations that have long histories of cattle domestication and are more dependent on cow milk. Sickle cell anemia, which may provide increased resistance to malaria, is frequent in populations where malaria is endemic. Populations that have for a very long time inhabited specific climates tend to have developed specific phenotypes that are beneficial for those environments\u00a0\u2013 short stature and stocky build in cold regions, tall and lanky in hot regions, and with high lung capacities or other adaptations at high altitudes. Some populations have evolved highly unique adaptations to very specific environmental conditions, such as those advantageous to ocean-dwelling lifestyles and freediving in the Bajau.\nHuman hair ranges in color from red to blond to brown to black, which is the most frequent. Hair color depends on the amount of melanin, with concentrations fading with increased age, leading to grey or even white hair. Skin color can range from darkest brown to lightest peach, or even nearly white or colorless in cases of albinism. It tends to vary clinally and generally correlates with the level of ultraviolet radiation in a particular geographic area, with darker skin mostly around the equator. Skin darkening may have evolved as protection against ultraviolet solar radiation. Light skin pigmentation protects against depletion of vitamin D, which requires sunlight to make. Human skin also has a capacity to darken (tan) in response to exposure to ultraviolet radiation.\nA Libyan, a Nubian, a Syrian, and an Egyptian, drawing by an unknown artist after a mural of the tomb of Seti I\nThere is relatively little variation between human geographical populations, and most of the variation that occurs is at the individual level. Much of human variation is continuous, often with no clear points of demarcation. Genetic data shows that no matter how population groups are defined, two people from the same population group are almost as different from each other as two people from any two different population groups. Dark-skinned populations that are found in Africa, Australia, and South Asia are not closely related to each other.\nGenetic research has demonstrated that human populations native to the African continent are the most genetically diverse and genetic diversity decreases with migratory distance from Africa, possibly the result of bottlenecks during human migration. These non-African populations acquired new genetic inputs from local admixture with archaic populations and have much greater variation from Neanderthals and Denisovans than is found in Africa, though Neanderthal admixture into African populations may be underestimated. Furthermore, recent studies have found that populations in sub-Saharan Africa, and particularly West Africa, have ancestral genetic variation which predates modern humans and has been lost in most non-African populations. Some of this ancestry is thought to originate from admixture with an unknown archaic hominin that diverged before the split of Neanderthals and modern humans.\nHumans are a gonochoric species, meaning they are divided into male and female sexes. The greatest degree of genetic variation exists between males and females. While the nucleotide genetic variation of individuals of the same sex across global populations is no greater than 0.1%\u20130.5%, the genetic difference between males and females is between 1% and 2%. Males on average are 15% heavier and 15\u00a0cm (6\u00a0in) taller than females. On average, men have about 40\u201350% more upper body strength and 20\u201330% more lower body strength than women at the same weight, due to higher amounts of muscle and larger muscle fibers. Women generally have a higher body fat percentage than men. Women have lighter skin than men of the same population; this has been explained by a higher need for vitamin D in females during pregnancy and lactation. As there are chromosomal differences between females and males, some X and Y chromosome-related conditions and disorders only affect either men or women. After allowing for body weight and volume, the male voice is usually an octave deeper than the female voice. Women have a longer life span in almost every population around the world. There are intersex conditions in the human population, however these are rare.\n\nPsychology\n\nMain article: Psychology\nDrawing of the human brain, showing several important structures\nThe human brain, the focal point of the central nervous system in humans, controls the peripheral nervous system. In addition to controlling \"lower\", involuntary, or primarily autonomic activities such as respiration and digestion, it is also the locus of \"higher\" order functioning such as thought, reasoning, and abstraction. These cognitive processes constitute the mind, and, along with their behavioral consequences, are studied in the field of psychology.\nHumans have a larger and more developed prefrontal cortex than other primates, the region of the brain associated with higher cognition. This has led humans to proclaim themselves to be more intelligent than any other known species. Objectively defining intelligence is difficult, with other animals adapting senses and excelling in areas that humans are unable to.\nThere are some traits that, although not strictly unique, do set humans apart from other animals. Humans may be the only animals who have episodic memory and who can engage in \"mental time travel\". Even compared with other social animals, humans have an unusually high degree of flexibility in their facial expressions. Humans are the only animals known to cry emotional tears. Humans are one of the few animals able to self-recognize in mirror tests and there is also debate over to what extent humans are the only animals with a theory of mind.\nSleep and dreaming\n\nMain articles: Sleep and Dream\nHumans are generally diurnal. The average sleep requirement is between seven and nine hours per day for an adult and nine to ten hours per day for a child; elderly people usually sleep for six to seven hours. Having less sleep than this is common among humans, even though sleep deprivation can have negative health effects. A sustained restriction of adult sleep to four hours per day has been shown to correlate with changes in physiology and mental state, including reduced memory, fatigue, aggression, and bodily discomfort.\nDuring sleep humans dream, where they experience sensory images and sounds. Dreaming is stimulated by the pons and mostly occurs during the REM phase of sleep. The length of a dream can vary, from a few seconds up to 30 minutes. Humans have three to five dreams per night, and some may have up to seven. Dreamers are more likely to remember the dream if awakened during the REM phase. The events in dreams are generally outside the control of the dreamer, with the exception of lucid dreaming, where the dreamer is self-aware. Dreams can at times make a creative thought occur or give a sense of inspiration.\nConsciousness and thought\n\nMain articles: Consciousness and Cognition\nHuman consciousness, at its simplest, is sentience or awareness of internal or external existence. Despite centuries of analyses, definitions, explanations and debates by philosophers and scientists, consciousness remains puzzling and controversial, being \"at once the most familiar and most mysterious aspect of our lives\". The only widely agreed notion about the topic is the intuition that it exists. Opinions differ about what exactly needs to be studied and explained as consciousness. Some philosophers divide consciousness into phenomenal consciousness, which is sensory experience itself, and access consciousness, which can be used for reasoning or directly controlling actions. It is sometimes synonymous with 'the mind', and at other times, an aspect of it. Historically it is associated with introspection, private thought, imagination and volition. It now often includes some kind of experience, cognition, feeling or perception. It may be 'awareness', or 'awareness of awareness', or self-awareness. There might be different levels or orders of consciousness, or different kinds of consciousness, or just one kind with different features.\nThe process of acquiring knowledge and understanding through thought, experience, and the senses is known as cognition. The human brain perceives the external world through the senses, and each individual human is influenced greatly by his or her experiences, leading to subjective views of existence and the passage of time. The nature of thought is central to psychology and related fields. Cognitive psychology studies cognition, the mental processes underlying behavior. Largely focusing on the development of the human mind through the life span, developmental psychology seeks to understand how people come to perceive, understand, and act within the world and how these processes change as they age. This may focus on intellectual, cognitive, neural, social, or moral development. Psychologists have developed intelligence tests and the concept of intelligence quotient in order to assess the relative intelligence of human beings and study its distribution among population.\nMotivation and emotion\n\nMain articles: Motivation and Emotion\nIllustration of grief from Charles Darwin's 1872 book The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals\nHuman motivation is not yet wholly understood. From a psychological perspective, Maslow's hierarchy of needs is a well-established theory that can be defined as the process of satisfying certain needs in ascending order of complexity. From a more general, philosophical perspective, human motivation can be defined as a commitment to, or withdrawal from, various goals requiring the application of human ability. Furthermore, incentive and preference are both factors, as are any perceived links between incentives and preferences. Volition may also be involved, in which case willpower is also a factor. Ideally, both motivation and volition ensure the selection, striving for, and realization of goals in an optimal manner, a function beginning in childhood and continuing throughout a lifetime in a process known as socialization.\nEmotions are biological states associated with the nervous system brought on by neurophysiological changes variously associated with thoughts, feelings, behavioral responses, and a degree of pleasure or displeasure. They are often intertwined with mood, temperament, personality, disposition, creativity, and motivation. Emotion has a significant influence on human behavior and their ability to learn. Acting on extreme or uncontrolled emotions can lead to social disorder and crime, with studies showing criminals may have a lower emotional intelligence than normal.\nEmotional experiences perceived as pleasant, such as joy, interest or contentment, contrast with those perceived as unpleasant, like anxiety, sadness, anger, and despair. Happiness, or the state of being happy, is a human emotional condition. The definition of happiness is a common philosophical topic. Some define it as experiencing the feeling of positive emotional affects, while avoiding the negative ones. Others see it as an appraisal of life satisfaction or quality of life. Recent research suggests that being happy might involve experiencing some negative emotions when humans feel they are warranted.\nSexuality and love\n\nMain articles: Human sexuality and Love\nHuman parents often display familial love for their children.\nFor humans, sexuality involves biological, erotic, physical, emotional, social, or spiritual feelings and behaviors. Because it is a broad term, which has varied with historical contexts over time, it lacks a precise definition. The biological and physical aspects of sexuality largely concern the human reproductive functions, including the human sexual response cycle. Sexuality also affects and is affected by cultural, political, legal, philosophical, moral, ethical, and religious aspects of life. Sexual desire, or libido, is a basic mental state present at the beginning of sexual behavior. Studies show that men desire sex more than women and masturbate more often.\nHumans can fall anywhere along a continuous scale of sexual orientation, although most humans are heterosexual. While homosexual behavior occurs in some other animals, only humans and domestic sheep have so far been found to exhibit exclusive preference for same-sex relationships. Most evidence supports nonsocial, biological causes of sexual orientation, as cultures that are very tolerant of homosexuality do not have significantly higher rates of it. Research in neuroscience and genetics suggests that other aspects of human sexuality are biologically influenced as well.\nLove most commonly refers to a feeling of strong attraction or emotional attachment. It can be impersonal (the love of an object, ideal, or strong political or spiritual connection) or interpersonal (love between humans). When in love dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin and other chemicals stimulate the brain's pleasure center, leading to side effects such as increased heart rate, loss of appetite and sleep, and an intense feeling of excitement.\n\nCulture\n\nMain articles: Culture and Cultural universal\n\nHuman society statisticsMost widely spoken languagesEnglish, Mandarin Chinese, Hindi, Spanish, Standard Arabic, Bengali, French, Russian, Portuguese, UrduMost practiced religionsChristianity, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, folk religions, Sikhism, Judaism, unaffiliated\nHumanity's unprecedented set of intellectual skills were a key factor in the species' eventual technological advancement and concomitant domination of the biosphere. Disregarding extinct hominids, humans are the only animals known to teach generalizable information, innately deploy recursive embedding to generate and communicate complex concepts, engage in the \"folk physics\" required for competent tool design, or cook food in the wild. Teaching and learning preserves the cultural and ethnographic identity of human societies. Other traits and behaviors that are mostly unique to humans include starting fires, phoneme structuring and vocal learning.\nLanguage\n\nMain article: Language\nPrincipal language families of the world (and in some cases geographic groups of families). For greater detail, see Distribution of languages in the world.\nWhile many species communicate, language is unique to humans, a defining feature of humanity, and a cultural universal. Unlike the limited systems of other animals, human language is open\u00a0\u2013 an infinite number of meanings can be produced by combining a limited number of symbols. Human language also has the capacity of displacement, using words to represent things and happenings that are not presently or locally occurring but reside in the shared imagination of interlocutors.\nLanguage differs from other forms of communication in that it is modality independent; the same meanings can be conveyed through different media, audibly in speech, visually by sign language or writing, and through tactile media such as braille. Language is central to the communication between humans, and to the sense of identity that unites nations, cultures and ethnic groups. There are approximately six thousand different languages currently in use, including sign languages, and many thousands more that are extinct.\nThe arts\n\nMain article: The arts\nHuman arts can take many forms including visual, literary, and performing. Visual art can range from paintings and sculptures to film, fashion design, and architecture. Literary arts can include prose, poetry, and dramas. The performing arts generally involve theatre, music, and dance. Humans often combine the different forms (for example, music videos). Other entities that have been described as having artistic qualities include food preparation, video games, and medicine. As well as providing entertainment and transferring knowledge, the arts are also used for political purposes.\nThe Deluge tablet of the Gilgamesh epic in Akkadian\nArt is a defining characteristic of humans and there is evidence for a relationship between creativity and language. The earliest evidence of art was shell engravings made by Homo erectus 300,000 years before modern humans evolved. Art attributed to H. sapiens existed at least 75,000 years ago, with jewellery and drawings found in caves in South Africa. There are various hypotheses as to why humans have adapted to the arts. These include allowing them to better problem solve issues, providing a means to control or influence other humans, encouraging cooperation and contribution within a society or increasing the chance of attracting a potential mate. The use of imagination developed through art, combined with logic may have given early humans an evolutionary advantage.\nEvidence of humans engaging in musical activities predates cave art and so far music has been practiced by virtually all known human cultures. There exists a wide variety of music genres and ethnic musics; with humans' musical abilities being related to other abilities, including complex social human behaviours. It has been shown that human brains respond to music by becoming synchronized with the rhythm and beat, a process called entrainment. Dance is also a form of human expression found in all cultures and may have evolved as a way to help early humans communicate. Listening to music and observing dance stimulates the orbitofrontal cortex and other pleasure sensing areas of the brain.\nUnlike speaking, reading and writing does not come naturally to humans and must be taught. Still, literature has been present before the invention of words and language, with 30,000-year-old paintings on walls inside some caves portraying a series of dramatic scenes. One of the oldest surviving works of literature is the Epic of Gilgamesh, first engraved on ancient Babylonian tablets about 4,000 years ago. Beyond simply passing down knowledge, the use and sharing of imaginative fiction through stories might have helped develop humans' capabilities for communication and increased the likelihood of securing a mate. Storytelling may also be used as a way to provide the audience with moral lessons and encourage cooperation.\nTools and technologies\n\nMain articles: Tool and Technology\nThe SCMaglev, the fastest train in the world clocking in at 603\u00a0km/h (375\u00a0mph) as of 2015\nStone tools were used by proto-humans at least 2.5\u00a0million years ago. The use and manufacture of tools has been put forward as the ability that defines humans more than anything else and has historically been seen as an important evolutionary step. The technology became much more sophisticated about 1.8 million years ago, with the controlled use of fire beginning around 1\u00a0million years ago. The wheel and wheeled vehicles appeared simultaneously in several regions some time in the fourth millennium BC. The development of more complex tools and technologies allowed land to be cultivated and animals to be domesticated, thus proving essential in the development of agriculture\u00a0\u2013 what is known as the Neolithic Revolution.\nChina developed paper, the printing press, gunpowder, the compass and other important inventions. The continued improvements in smelting allowed forging of copper, bronze, iron and eventually steel, which is used in railways, skyscrapers and many other products. This coincided with the Industrial Revolution, where the invention of automated machines brought major changes to humans' lifestyles. Modern technology is observed as progressing exponentially, with major innovations in the 20th century including: electricity, penicillin, semiconductors, internal combustion engines, the Internet, nitrogen fixing fertilisers, airplanes, computers, automobiles, contraceptive pills, nuclear fission, the green revolution, radio, scientific plant breeding, rockets, air conditioning, television and the assembly line.\nReligion and spirituality\n\nMain articles: Religion and Spirituality\nShango, the Orisha of fire, lightning, and thunder, in the Yoruba religion, depicted on horseback\nDefinitions of religion vary; according to one definition, a religion is a belief system concerning the supernatural, sacred or divine, and practices, values, institutions and rituals associated with such belief. Some religions also have a moral code. The evolution and the history of the first religions have become areas of active scientific investigation. Credible evidence of religious behaviour dates to the Middle Paleolithic era (45\u2013200 thousand years ago). It may have evolved to play a role in helping enforce and encourage cooperation between humans.\nReligion manifests in diverse forms. Religion can include a belief in life after death, the origin of life, the nature of the universe (religious cosmology) and its ultimate fate (eschatology), and moral or ethical teachings. Views on transcendence and immanence vary substantially; traditions variously espouse monism, deism, pantheism, and theism (including polytheism and monotheism).\nAlthough measuring religiosity is difficult, a majority of humans profess some variety of religious or spiritual belief. In 2015 the plurality were Christian followed by Muslims, Hindus and Buddhists. As of 2015, about 16%, or slightly under 1.2 billion humans, were irreligious, including those with no religious beliefs or no identity with any religion.\nScience and philosophy\n\nMain articles: Science and Philosophy\nThe Dunhuang map, a star map showing the North Polar region. China circa 700.\nAn aspect unique to humans is their ability to transmit knowledge from one generation to the next and to continually build on this information to develop tools, scientific laws and other advances to pass on further. This accumulated knowledge can be tested to answer questions or make predictions about how the universe functions and has been very successful in advancing human ascendancy.\nAristotle has been described as the first scientist, and preceded the rise of scientific thought through the Hellenistic period. Other early advances in science came from the Han Dynasty in China and during the Islamic Golden Age. The scientific revolution, near the end of the Renaissance, led to the emergence of modern science.\nA chain of events and influences led to the development of the scientific method, a process of observation and experimentation that is used to differentiate science from pseudoscience. An understanding of mathematics is unique to humans, although other species of animals have some numerical cognition. All of science can be divided into three major branches, the formal sciences (e.g., logic and mathematics), which are concerned with formal systems, the applied sciences (e.g., engineering, medicine), which are focused on practical applications, and the empirical sciences, which are based on empirical observation and are in turn divided into natural sciences (e.g., physics, chemistry, biology) and social sciences (e.g., psychology, economics, sociology).\nPhilosophy is a field of study where humans seek to understand fundamental truths about themselves and the world in which they live. Philosophical inquiry has been a major feature in the development of humans' intellectual history. It has been described as the \"no man's land\" between definitive scientific knowledge and dogmatic religious teachings. Philosophy relies on reason and evidence, unlike religion, but does not require the empirical observations and experiments provided by science. Major fields of philosophy include metaphysics, epistemology, logic, and axiology (which includes ethics and aesthetics).\n\nSociety\n\nMain article: Society\nHumans often live in family-based social structures\nSociety is the system of organizations and institutions arising from interaction between humans. Humans are highly social and tend to live in large complex social groups. They can be divided into different groups according to their income, wealth, power, reputation and other factors. The structure of social stratification and the degree of social mobility differs, especially between modern and traditional societies. Human groups range from the size of families to nations. The first form of human social organization is thought to have resembled hunter-gatherer band societies.\nGender\n\nMain article: Gender\nHuman societies typically exhibit gender identities and gender roles that distinguish between masculine and feminine characteristics and prescribe the range of acceptable behaviours and attitudes for their members based on their sex. The most common categorisation is a gender binary of men and women. Many societies recognise a third gender, or less commonly a fourth or fifth. In some other societies, non-binary is used as an umbrella term for a range of gender identities that are not solely male or female.\nGender roles are often associated with a division of norms, practices, dress, behavior, rights, duties, privileges, status, and power, with men enjoying more rights and privileges than women in most societies, both today and in the past. As a social construct, gender roles are not fixed and vary historically within a society. Challenges to predominant gender norms have recurred in many societies. Little is known about gender roles in the earliest human societies. Early modern humans probably had a range of gender roles similar to that of modern cultures from at least the Upper Paleolithic, while the Neanderthals were less sexually dimorphic and there is evidence that the behavioural difference between males and females was minimal.\nKinship\n\nMain article: Kinship\nAll human societies organize, recognize and classify types of social relationships based on relations between parents, children and other descendants (consanguinity), and relations through marriage (affinity). There is also a third type applied to godparents or adoptive children (fictive). These culturally defined relationships are referred to as kinship. In many societies, it is one of the most important social organizing principles and plays a role in transmitting status and inheritance.\u00a0All societies have rules of incest taboo, according to which marriage between certain kinds of kin relations are prohibited, and some also have rules of preferential marriage with certain kin relations.\nEthnicity\n\nMain article: Ethnic group\nHuman ethnic groups are a social category that identifies together as a group based on shared attributes that distinguish them from other groups. These can be a common set of traditions, ancestry, language, history, society, culture, nation, religion, or social treatment within their residing area. Ethnicity is separate from the concept of race, which is based on physical characteristics, although both are socially constructed. Assigning ethnicity to a certain population is complicated, as even within common ethnic designations there can be a diverse range of subgroups, and the makeup of these ethnic groups can change over time at both the collective and individual level. Also, there is no generally accepted definition of what constitutes an ethnic group. Ethnic groupings can play a powerful role in the social identity and solidarity of ethnopolitical units. This has been closely tied to the rise of the nation state as the predominant form of political organization in the 19th and 20th centuries.\nGovernment and politics\n\nMain articles: Government and Politics\nThe United Nations headquarters in New York City, which houses one of the world's largest political organizations\nAs farming populations gathered in larger and denser communities, interactions between these different groups increased. This led to the development of governance within and between the communities. Humans have evolved the ability to change affiliation with various social groups relatively easily, including previously strong political alliances, if doing so is seen as providing personal advantages. This cognitive flexibility allows individual humans to change their political ideologies, with those with higher flexibility less likely to support authoritarian and nationalistic stances.\nGovernments create laws and policies that affect the citizens that they govern. There have been many forms of government throughout human history, each having various means of obtaining power and the ability to exert diverse controls on the population. Approximately 47% of humans live in some form of a democracy, 17% in a hybrid regime, and 37% in an authoritarian regime. Many countries belong to international organizations and alliances; the largest of these is the United Nations, with 193 member states.\nTrade and economics\n\nMain articles: Trade and Economics\nThe Silk Road (red) and spice trade routes (blue)\nTrade, the voluntary exchange of goods and services, is seen as a characteristic that differentiates humans from other animals and has been cited as a practice that gave Homo sapiens a major advantage over other hominids. Evidence suggests early H. sapiens made use of long-distance trade routes to exchange goods and ideas, leading to cultural explosions and providing additional food sources when hunting was sparse, while such trade networks did not exist for the now extinct Neanderthals. Early trade likely involved materials for creating tools like obsidian. The first truly international trade routes were around the spice trade through the Roman and medieval periods.\nEarly human economies were more likely to be based around gift giving instead of a bartering system. Early money consisted of commodities; the oldest being in the form of cattle and the most widely used being cowrie shells. Money has since evolved into governmental issued coins, paper and electronic money. Human study of economics is a social science that looks at how societies distribute scarce resources among different people. There are massive inequalities in the division of wealth among humans; the eight richest humans are worth the same monetary value as the poorest half of all the human population.\nConflict\n\nFurther information: War and Violence\nAmerican troops landing at Normandy, WWII.\nHumans commit violence on other humans at a rate comparable to other primates, but have an increased preference for killing adults, infanticide being more common among other primates. Phylogenetic analysis predicts that 2% of early H. sapiens would be murdered, rising to 12% during the medieval period, before dropping to below 2% in modern times. There is great variation in violence between human populations with rates of homicide in societies that have legal systems and strong cultural attitudes against violence at about 0.01%.\nThe willingness of humans to kill other members of their species en masse through organized conflict (i.e., war) has long been the subject of debate. One school of thought holds that war evolved as a means to eliminate competitors, and has always been an innate human characteristic. Another suggests that war is a relatively recent phenomenon and has appeared due to changing social conditions. While not settled, current evidence indicates warlike predispositions only became common about 10,000 years ago, and in many places much more recently than that. War has had a high cost on human life; it is estimated that during the 20th century, between 167 million and 188 million people died as a result of war. War casualty data is less reliable for pre-medieval times, especially global figures. But compared with any period over the past 600 years, the last ~80 years (post 1946), has seen a very significant drop in global military and civilian death rates due to armed conflict.\n\nSee also\nMammals portalEvolutionary biology portalScience portal\nList of human evolution fossils\nTimeline of human evolution\n\n\nNotes\n^ The world population and population density statistics are updated automatically from a template that uses the CIA World Factbook and United Nations World Population Prospects.\n\n^ Cities with over 10 million inhabitants as of 2018.\n\n^ Traditionally this has been explained by conflicting evolutionary pressures involved in bipedalism and encephalization (called the obstetrical dilemma), but recent research suggest it might be more complicated than that."

    "content": "Hebbian theory is a neuropsychological theory claiming that an increase in synaptic efficacy arises from a presynaptic cell's repeated and persistent stimulation of a postsynaptic cell. It is an attempt to explain synaptic plasticity, the adaptation of brain neurons during the learning process. It was introduced by Donald Hebb in his 1949 book The Organization of Behavior. The theory is also called Hebb's rule, Hebb's postulate, and cell assembly theory. Hebb states it as follows:\nThe theory is often summarized as \"Cells that fire together wire together.\" However, Hebb emphasized that cell A needs to \"take part in firing\" cell B, and such causality can occur only if cell A fires just before, not at the same time as, cell B. This aspect of causation in Hebb's work foreshadowed what is now known about spike-timing-dependent plasticity, which requires temporal precedence.\nThe theory attempts to explain associative or Hebbian learning, in which simultaneous activation of cells leads to pronounced increases in synaptic strength between those cells. It also provides a biological basis for errorless learning methods for education and memory rehabilitation. In the study of neural networks in cognitive function, it is often regarded as the neuronal basis of unsupervised learning.\n\nHebbian engrams and cell assembly theory[edit]\nHebbian theory concerns how neurons might connect themselves to become engrams. Hebb's theories on the form and function of cell assemblies can be understood from the following:\nThe general idea is an old one, that any two cells or systems of cells that are repeatedly active at the same time will tend to become 'associated' so that activity in one facilitates activity in the other.\nHebb also wrote:\nWhen one cell repeatedly assists in firing another, the axon of the first cell develops synaptic knobs (or enlarges them if they already exist) in contact with the soma of the second cell.\n[D. Alan Allport] posits additional ideas regarding cell assembly theory and its role in forming engrams, along the lines of the concept of auto-association, described as follows:\nIf the inputs to a system cause the same pattern of activity to occur repeatedly, the set of active elements constituting that pattern will become increasingly strongly inter-associated. That is, each element will tend to turn on every other element and (with negative weights) to turn off the elements that do not form part of the pattern. To put it another way, the pattern as a whole will become 'auto-associated'.  We may call a learned (auto-associated) pattern an engram.\nWork in the laboratory of Eric Kandel has provided evidence for the involvement of Hebbian learning mechanisms at synapses in the marine gastropod Aplysia californica. Experiments on Hebbian synapse modification mechanisms at the central nervous system synapses of vertebrates are much more difficult to control than are experiments with the relatively simple peripheral nervous system synapses studied in marine invertebrates. Much of the work on long-lasting synaptic changes between vertebrate neurons (such as long-term potentiation) involves the use of non-physiological experimental stimulation of brain cells. However, some of the physiologically relevant synapse modification mechanisms that have been studied in vertebrate brains do seem to be examples of Hebbian processes. One such study reviews results from experiments that indicate that long-lasting changes in synaptic strengths can be induced by physiologically relevant synaptic activity working through both Hebbian and non-Hebbian mechanisms.\n\nPrinciples[edit]\nFrom the point of view of artificial neurons and artificial neural networks, Hebb's principle can be described as a method of determining how to alter the weights between model neurons. The weight between two neurons increases if the two neurons activate simultaneously, and reduces if they activate separately. Nodes that tend to be either both positive or both negative at the same time have strong positive weights, while those that tend to be opposite have strong negative weights.\nThe following is a formulaic description of Hebbian learning: (many other descriptions are possible)\nw\n\ni\nj\n\n\n=\n\nx\n\ni\n\n\n\nx\n\nj\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\,w_{ij}=x_{i}x_{j}}\nwhere \n\n\n\n\nw\n\ni\nj\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle w_{ij}}\n\n is the weight of the connection from neuron \n\n\n\nj\n\n\n{\\displaystyle j}\n\n to neuron \n\n\n\ni\n\n\n{\\displaystyle i}\n\n and \n\n\n\n\nx\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x_{i}}\n\n the input for neuron \n\n\n\ni\n\n\n{\\displaystyle i}\n\n. Note that this is pattern learning (weights updated after every training example). In a Hopfield network, connections \n\n\n\n\nw\n\ni\nj\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle w_{ij}}\n\n are set to zero if \n\n\n\ni\n=\nj\n\n\n{\\displaystyle i=j}\n\n (no reflexive connections allowed). With binary neurons (activations either 0 or 1), connections would be set to 1 if the connected neurons have the same activation for a pattern.\nWhen several training patterns are used the expression becomes an average of individual ones:\nw\n\ni\nj\n\n\n=\n\n\n1\np\n\n\n\n\u2211\n\nk\n=\n1\n\n\np\n\n\n\nx\n\ni\n\n\nk\n\n\n\nx\n\nj\n\n\nk\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle w_{ij}={\\frac {1}{p}}\\sum _{k=1}^{p}x_{i}^{k}x_{j}^{k}}\nwhere \n\n\n\n\nw\n\ni\nj\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle w_{ij}}\n\n is the weight of the connection from neuron \n\n\n\nj\n\n\n{\\displaystyle j}\n\n to neuron \n\n\n\ni\n\n\n{\\displaystyle i}\n\n, \n\n\n\np\n\n\n{\\displaystyle p}\n\n is the number of training patterns and \n\n\n\n\nx\n\ni\n\n\nk\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x_{i}^{k}}\n\n the \n\n\n\nk\n\n\n{\\displaystyle k}\n\n-th input for neuron \n\n\n\ni\n\n\n{\\displaystyle i}\n\n. This is learning by epoch (weights updated after all the training examples are presented), being last term applicable to both discrete and continuous training sets. Again, in a Hopfield network, connections \n\n\n\n\nw\n\ni\nj\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle w_{ij}}\n\n are set to zero if \n\n\n\ni\n=\nj\n\n\n{\\displaystyle i=j}\n\n (no reflexive connections).\nA variation of Hebbian learning that takes into account phenomena such as blocking and many other neural learning phenomena is the mathematical model of Harry Klopf. Klopf's model reproduces a great many biological phenomena, and is also simple to implement.\n\nRelationship to unsupervised learning, stability, and generalization[edit]\nBecause of the simple nature of Hebbian learning, based only on the coincidence of pre- and post-synaptic activity, it may not be intuitively clear why this form of plasticity leads to meaningful learning. However, it can be shown that Hebbian plasticity does pick up the statistical properties of the input in a way that can be categorized as unsupervised learning.\nThis can be mathematically shown in a simplified example. Let us work under the simplifying assumption of a single rate-based neuron of rate \n\n\n\ny\n(\nt\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle y(t)}\n\n, whose inputs have rates \n\n\n\n\nx\n\n1\n\n\n(\nt\n)\n.\n.\n.\n\nx\n\nN\n\n\n(\nt\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x_{1}(t)...x_{N}(t)}\n\n.

Intuitively, this is because whenever the presynaptic neuron excites the postsynaptic neuron, the weight between them is reinforced, causing an even stronger excitation in the future, and so forth, in a self-reinforcing way. One may think a solution is to limit the firing rate of the postsynaptic neuron by adding a non-linear, saturating response function \n\n\n\nf\n\n\n{\\displaystyle f}\n\n, but in fact, it can be shown that for any neuron model, Hebb's rule is unstable. Therefore, network models of neurons usually employ other learning theories such as BCM theory, Oja's rule, or the generalized Hebbian algorithm.\nRegardless, even for the unstable solution above, one can see that, when sufficient time has passed, one of the terms dominates over the others, and\nw\n\n(\nt\n)\n\u2248\n\ne\n\n\u03b7\n\n\u03b1\n\n\u2217\n\n\nt\n\n\n\n\nc\n\n\n\u2217\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathbf {w} (t)\\approx e^{\\eta \\alpha ^{*}t}\\mathbf {c} ^{*}}\nwhere \n\n\n\n\n\u03b1\n\n\u2217\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\alpha ^{*}}\n\n is the largest eigenvalue of \n\n\n\nC\n\n\n{\\displaystyle C}\n\n. At this time, the postsynaptic neuron performs the following operation:\ny\n\u2248\n\ne\n\n\u03b7\n\n\u03b1\n\n\u2217\n\n\nt\n\n\n\n\nc\n\n\n\u2217\n\n\n\nx\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle y\\approx e^{\\eta \\alpha ^{*}t}\\mathbf {c} ^{*}\\mathbf {x} }\nBecause, again, \n\n\n\n\n\nc\n\n\n\u2217\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathbf {c} ^{*}}\n\n is the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue of the correlation matrix between the \n\n\n\n\nx\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x_{i}}\n\ns, this corresponds exactly to computing the first principal component of the input.\nThis mechanism can be extended to performing a full PCA (principal component analysis) of the input by adding further postsynaptic neurons, provided the postsynaptic neurons are prevented from all picking up the same principal component, for example by adding lateral inhibition in the postsynaptic layer. We have thus connected Hebbian learning to PCA, which is an elementary form of unsupervised learning, in the sense that the network can pick up useful statistical aspects of the input, and \"describe\" them in a distilled way in its output.\n\nLimitations[edit]\nDespite the common use of Hebbian models for long-term potentiation, Hebb's principle does not cover all forms of synaptic long-term plasticity. Hebb did not postulate any rules for inhibitory synapses, nor did he make predictions for anti-causal spike sequences (presynaptic neuron fires after the postsynaptic neuron). Synaptic modification may not simply occur only between activated neurons A and B, but at neighboring synapses as well. All forms of hetero synaptic and homeostatic plasticity are therefore considered non-Hebbian. An example is retrograde signaling to presynaptic terminals. The compound most commonly identified as fulfilling this retrograde transmitter role is nitric oxide, which, due to its high solubility and diffusivity, often exerts effects on nearby neurons. This type of diffuse synaptic modification, known as volume learning, is not included in the traditional Hebbian model.\n\nHebbian learning account of mirror neurons[edit]\nHebbian learning and spike-timing-dependent plasticity have been used in an influential theory of how mirror neurons emerge. Mirror neurons are neurons that fire both when an individual performs an action and when the individual sees or hears another perform a similar action. The discovery of these neurons has been very influential in explaining how individuals make sense of the actions of others, by showing that, when a person perceives the actions of others, the person activates the motor programs which they would use to perform similar actions. The activation of these motor programs then adds information to the perception and helps predict what the person will do next based on the perceiver's own motor program. A challenge has been to explain how individuals come to have neurons that respond both while performing an action and while hearing or seeing another perform similar actions.\nChristian Keysers and David Perrett suggested that as an individual performs a particular action, the individual will see, hear, and feel the  performing of the action. These re-afferent sensory signals will trigger activity in neurons responding to the sight, sound, and feel of the action. Because the activity of these sensory neurons will consistently overlap in time with those of the motor neurons that caused the action, Hebbian learning predicts that the synapses connecting neurons responding to the sight, sound, and feel of an action and those of the neurons triggering the action should be potentiated. The same is true while people look at themselves in the mirror, hear themselves babble, or are imitated by others. After repeated experience of this re-afference, the synapses connecting the sensory and motor representations of an action are so strong that the motor neurons start firing to the sound or the vision of the action, and a mirror neuron is created.\nEvidence for that perspective comes from many experiments that show that motor programs can be triggered by novel auditory or visual stimuli after repeated pairing of the stimulus with the execution of the motor program (for a review of the evidence, see Giudice et al., 2009). For instance, people who have never played the piano do not activate brain regions involved in playing the piano when listening to piano music. Five hours of piano lessons, in which the participant is exposed to the sound of the piano each time they press a key is proven sufficient to trigger activity in motor regions of the brain upon listening to piano music when heard at a later time. Consistent with the fact that spike-timing-dependent plasticity occurs only if the presynaptic neuron's firing predicts the post-synaptic neuron's firing, the link between sensory stimuli and motor programs also only seem to be potentiated if the stimulus is contingent on the motor program.\n\nSee also[edit]\nDale's principle\nCoincidence detection in neurobiology\nLeabra\nMetaplasticity\nTetanic stimulation\nSynaptotropic hypothesis\nNeuroplasticity\nBehaviorism"

    "content": "\nA star is a luminous spheroid of plasma held together by self-gravity. The nearest star to Earth is the Sun. Many other stars are visible to the naked eye at night; their immense distances from Earth make them appear as fixed points of light. The most prominent stars have been categorised into constellations and asterisms, and many of the brightest stars have proper names. Astronomers have assembled star catalogues that identify the known stars and provide standardized stellar designations. The observable universe contains an estimated 10 to 10 stars. Only about 4,000 of these stars are visible to the naked eye\u2014all within the Milky Way galaxy.\nA star's life begins with the gravitational collapse of a gaseous nebula of material largely comprising hydrogen, helium, and trace heavier elements. Its total mass mainly determines its evolution and eventual fate. A star shines for most of its active life due to the thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium in its core. This process releases energy that traverses the star's interior and radiates into outer space. At the end of a star's lifetime as a fusor, its core becomes a stellar remnant: a white dwarf, a neutron star, or\u2014if it is sufficiently massive\u2014a black hole.\nStellar nucleosynthesis in stars or their remnants creates almost all naturally occurring chemical elements heavier than lithium. Stellar mass loss or supernova explosions return chemically enriched material to the interstellar medium. These elements are then recycled into new stars. Astronomers can determine stellar properties\u2014including mass, age, metallicity (chemical composition), variability, distance, and motion through space\u2014by carrying out observations of a star's apparent brightness, spectrum, and changes in its position in the sky over time.\nStars can form orbital systems with other astronomical objects, as in planetary systems and star systems with two or more stars. When two such stars orbit closely, their gravitational interaction can significantly impact their evolution. Stars can form part of a much larger gravitationally bound structure, such as a star cluster or a galaxy.\n\nEtymology\nThe word \"star\" ultimately derives from the Proto-Indo-European root \"h\u2082st\u1e17r\" also meaning star, but further analyzable as h\u2082eh\u2081s- (\"to burn\", also the source of the word \"ash\") + -t\u0113r (agentive suffix). Compare Latin stella, Greek aster, German Stern. Some scholars believe the word is a borrowing from Akkadian \"istar\" (venus), however some doubt that suggestion. Star is cognate (shares the same root) with the following words: asterisk, asteroid, astral, constellation, Esther.\n\nObservation history\n\nSee also: Stars in astrology\nPeople have interpreted patterns and images in the stars since ancient times. This 1690 depiction of the constellation of Leo, the lion, is by Johannes Hevelius.\nHistorically, stars have been important to civilizations throughout the world. They have been part of religious practices, used for celestial navigation and orientation, to mark the passage of seasons, and to define calendars.\nEarly astronomers recognized a difference between \"fixed stars\", whose position on the celestial sphere does not change, and \"wandering stars\" (planets), which move noticeably relative to the fixed stars over days or weeks. Many ancient astronomers believed that the stars were permanently affixed to a heavenly sphere and that they were immutable. By convention, astronomers grouped prominent stars into asterisms and constellations and used them to track the motions of the planets and the inferred position of the Sun. The motion of the Sun against the background stars (and the horizon) was used to create calendars, which could be used to regulate agricultural practices. The Gregorian calendar, currently used nearly everywhere in the world, is a solar calendar based on the angle of the Earth's rotational axis relative to its local star, the Sun.\nThe oldest accurately dated star chart was the result of ancient Egyptian astronomy in 1534\u00a0BC. The earliest known star catalogues were compiled by the ancient Babylonian astronomers of Mesopotamia in the late 2nd millennium BC, during the Kassite Period (c.\u20091531 BC\u00a0\u2013 c.\u20091155 BC).\nStars in the night sky\nThe first star catalogue in Greek astronomy was created by Aristillus in approximately 300\u00a0BC, with the help of Timocharis. The star catalog of Hipparchus (2nd century BC) included 1,020 stars, and was used to assemble Ptolemy's star catalogue. Hipparchus is known for the discovery of the first recorded nova (new star). Many of the constellations and star names in use today derive from Greek astronomy.\nDespite the apparent immutability of the heavens, Chinese astronomers were aware that new stars could appear. In 185\u00a0AD, they were the first to observe and write about a supernova, now known as SN 185. The brightest stellar event in recorded history was the SN 1006 supernova, which was observed in 1006 and written about by the Egyptian astronomer Ali ibn Ridwan and several Chinese astronomers. The SN 1054 supernova, which gave birth to the Crab Nebula, was also observed by Chinese and Islamic astronomers.\nMedieval Islamic astronomers gave Arabic names to many stars that are still used today and they invented numerous astronomical instruments that could compute the positions of the stars. They built the first large observatory research institutes, mainly to produce Zij star catalogues. Among these, the Book of Fixed Stars (964) was written by the Persian astronomer Abd al-Rahman al-Sufi, who observed a number of stars, star clusters (including the Omicron Velorum and Brocchi's Clusters) and galaxies (including the Andromeda Galaxy). According to A. Zahoor, in the 11th century, the Persian polymath scholar Abu Rayhan Biruni described the Milky Way galaxy as a multitude of fragments having the properties of nebulous stars, and gave the latitudes of various stars during a lunar eclipse in 1019.\nAccording to Josep Puig, the Andalusian astronomer Ibn Bajjah proposed that the Milky Way was made up of many stars that almost touched one another and appeared to be a continuous image due to the effect of refraction from sublunary material, citing his observation of the conjunction of Jupiter and Mars on 500 AH (1106/1107\u00a0AD) as evidence. \nEarly European astronomers such as Tycho Brahe identified new stars in the night sky (later termed novae), suggesting that the heavens were not immutable. In 1584, Giordano Bruno suggested that the stars were like the Sun, and may have other planets, possibly even Earth-like, in orbit around them, an idea that had been suggested earlier by the ancient Greek philosophers, Democritus and Epicurus, and by medieval Islamic cosmologists such as Fakhr al-Din al-Razi. By the following century, the idea of the stars being the same as the Sun was reaching a consensus among astronomers. To explain why these stars exerted no net gravitational pull on the Solar System, Isaac Newton suggested that the stars were equally distributed in every direction, an idea prompted by the theologian Richard Bentley.\nThe Italian astronomer Geminiano Montanari recorded observing variations in luminosity of the star Algol in 1667. Edmond Halley published the first measurements of the proper motion of a pair of nearby \"fixed\" stars, demonstrating that they had changed positions since the time of the ancient Greek astronomers Ptolemy and Hipparchus.\nWilliam Herschel was the first astronomer to attempt to determine the distribution of stars in the sky. During the 1780s, he established a series of gauges in 600 directions and counted the stars observed along each line of sight. From this, he deduced that the number of stars steadily increased toward one side of the sky, in the direction of the Milky Way core. His son John Herschel repeated this study in the southern hemisphere and found a corresponding increase in the same direction. In addition to his other accomplishments, William Herschel is noted for his discovery that some stars do not merely lie along the same line of sight, but are physical companions that form binary star systems.\nThe science of stellar spectroscopy was pioneered by Joseph von Fraunhofer and Angelo Secchi. By comparing the spectra of stars such as Sirius to the Sun, they found differences in the strength and number of their absorption lines\u2014the dark lines in stellar spectra caused by the atmosphere's absorption of specific frequencies. In 1865, Secchi began classifying stars into spectral types. The modern version of the stellar classification scheme was developed by Annie J. Cannon during the early 1900s.\nThe first direct measurement of the distance to a star (61 Cygni at 11.4 light-years) was made in 1838 by Friedrich Bessel using the parallax technique. Parallax measurements demonstrated the vast separation of the stars in the heavens. Observation of double stars gained increasing importance during the 19th century. In 1834, Friedrich Bessel observed changes in the proper motion of the star Sirius and inferred a hidden companion. Edward Pickering discovered the first spectroscopic binary in 1899 when he observed the periodic splitting of the spectral lines of the star Mizar in a 104-day period. Detailed observations of many binary star systems were collected by astronomers such as Friedrich Georg Wilhelm von Struve and S. W. Burnham, allowing the masses of stars to be determined from computation of orbital elements. The first solution to the problem of deriving an orbit of binary stars from telescope observations was made by Felix Savary in 1827.\nThe twentieth century saw increasingly rapid advances in the scientific study of stars. The photograph became a valuable astronomical tool. Karl Schwarzschild discovered that the color of a star and, hence, its temperature, could be determined by comparing the visual magnitude against the photographic magnitude. The development of the photoelectric photometer allowed precise measurements of magnitude at multiple wavelength intervals. In 1921 Albert A. Michelson made the first measurements of a stellar diameter using an interferometer on the Hooker telescope at Mount Wilson Observatory.\nImportant theoretical work on the physical structure of stars occurred during the first decades of the twentieth century. In 1913, the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram was developed, propelling the astrophysical study of stars. Successful models were developed to explain the interiors of stars and stellar evolution. Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin first proposed that stars were made primarily of hydrogen and helium in her 1925 PhD thesis. The spectra of stars were further understood through advances in quantum physics. This allowed the chemical composition of the stellar atmosphere to be determined.\nInfrared image from NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope showing hundreds of thousands of stars in the Milky Way galaxy\nWith the exception of rare events such as supernovae and supernova imposters, individual stars have primarily been observed in the Local Group, and especially in the visible part of the Milky Way (as demonstrated by the detailed star catalogues available for the Milky Way galaxy) and its satellites. Individual stars such as Cepheid variables have been observed in the M87 and M100 galaxies of the Virgo Cluster, as well as luminous stars in some other relatively nearby galaxies. With the aid of gravitational lensing, a single star (named Icarus) has been observed at 9\u00a0billion light-years away.\n\nDesignations\n\nMain articles: Stellar designation, Astronomical naming conventions, and Star catalogue\nThe concept of a constellation was known to exist during the Babylonian period. Ancient sky watchers imagined that prominent arrangements of stars formed patterns, and they associated these with particular aspects of nature or their myths. Twelve of these formations lay along the band of the ecliptic and these became the basis of astrology. Many of the more prominent individual stars were given names, particularly with Arabic or Latin designations.\nAs well as certain constellations and the Sun itself, individual stars have their own myths. To the Ancient Greeks, some \"stars\", known as planets (Greek \u03c0\u03bb\u03b1\u03bd\u03ae\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 (plan\u0113t\u0113s), meaning \"wanderer\"), represented various important deities, from which the names of the planets Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn were taken. (Uranus and Neptune were Greek and Roman gods, but neither planet was known in Antiquity because of their low brightness. Their names were assigned by later astronomers.)\nCirca 1600, the names of the constellations were used to name the stars in the corresponding regions of the sky. The German astronomer Johann Bayer created a series of star maps and applied Greek letters as designations to the stars in each constellation. Later a numbering system based on the star's right ascension was invented and added to John Flamsteed's star catalogue in his book \"Historia coelestis Britannica\" (the 1712 edition), whereby this numbering system came to be called Flamsteed designation or Flamsteed numbering.\nThe internationally recognized authority for naming celestial bodies is the International Astronomical Union (IAU). The International Astronomical Union maintains the Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) which catalogs and standardizes proper names for stars. A number of private companies sell names of stars which are not recognized by the IAU, professional astronomers, or the amateur astronomy community. The British Library calls this an unregulated commercial enterprise, and the New York City Department of Consumer and Worker Protection issued a violation against one such star-naming company for engaging in a deceptive trade practice.\n\nUnits of measurement\nAlthough stellar parameters can be expressed in SI units or Gaussian units, it is often most convenient to express mass, luminosity, and radii in solar units, based on the characteristics of the Sun. In 2015, the IAU defined a set of nominal solar values (defined as SI constants, without uncertainties) which can be used for quoting stellar parameters:\nnominal solar luminosity\n\nL\u2609 = 3.828\u00d710\u00a0W \n\n\nnominal solar radius\n\nR\u2609 = 6.957\u00d710\u00a0m\nThe solar mass M\u2609 was not explicitly defined by the IAU due to the large relative uncertainty (10) of the Newtonian constant of gravitation G. Since the product of the Newtonian constant of gravitation and solar mass\ntogether (GM\u2609) has been determined to much greater precision, the IAU defined the nominal solar mass parameter to be:\nnominal solar mass parameter:\n\nGM\u2609 = 1.3271244\u00d710\u00a0m/s\nThe nominal solar mass parameter can be combined with the most recent (2014) CODATA estimate of the Newtonian constant of gravitation G to derive the solar mass to be approximately 1.9885\u00d710\u00a0kg. Although the exact values for the luminosity, radius, mass parameter, and mass may vary slightly in the future due to observational uncertainties, the 2015 IAU nominal constants will remain the same SI values as they remain useful measures for quoting stellar parameters.\nLarge lengths, such as the radius of a giant star or the semi-major axis of a binary star system, are often expressed in terms of the astronomical unit\u2014approximately equal to the mean distance between the Earth and the Sun (150\u00a0million km or approximately 93\u00a0million miles). In 2012, the IAU defined the astronomical constant to be an exact length in meters: 149,597,870,700 m.\n\nFormation and evolution\n\nMain article: Stellar evolution\nStellar evolution of low-mass (left cycle) and high-mass (right cycle) stars, with examples in italics\nStars condense from regions of space of higher matter density, yet those regions are less dense than within a vacuum chamber. These regions\u2014known as molecular clouds\u2014consist mostly of hydrogen, with about 23 to 28 percent helium and a few percent heavier elements. One example of such a star-forming region is the Orion Nebula. Most stars form in groups of dozens to hundreds of thousands of stars. Massive stars in these groups may powerfully illuminate those clouds, ionizing the hydrogen, and creating H II regions. Such feedback effects, from star formation, may ultimately disrupt the cloud and prevent further star formation.\nAll stars spend the majority of their existence as main sequence stars, fueled primarily by the nuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium within their cores. However, stars of different masses have markedly different properties at various stages of their development. The ultimate fate of more massive stars differs from that of less massive stars, as do their luminosities and the impact they have on their environment. Accordingly, astronomers often group stars by their mass:\nVery low mass stars, with masses below 0.5\u00a0M\u2609, are fully convective and distribute helium evenly throughout the whole star while on the main sequence. Therefore, they never undergo shell burning and never become red giants. After exhausting their hydrogen they become helium white dwarfs and slowly cool. As the lifetime of 0.5\u00a0M\u2609 stars is longer than the age of the universe, no such star has yet reached the white dwarf stage.\nLow mass stars (including the Sun), with a mass between 0.5\u00a0M\u2609 and ~2.25\u00a0M\u2609 depending on composition, do become red giants as their core hydrogen is depleted and they begin to burn helium in core in a helium flash; they develop a degenerate carbon-oxygen core later on the asymptotic giant branch; they finally blow off their outer shell as a planetary nebula and leave behind their core in the form of a white dwarf.\nIntermediate-mass stars, between ~2.25\u00a0M\u2609 and ~8\u00a0M\u2609, pass through evolutionary stages similar to low mass stars, but after a relatively short period on the red-giant branch they ignite helium without a flash and spend an extended period in the red clump before forming a degenerate carbon-oxygen core.\nMassive stars generally have a minimum mass of ~8\u00a0M\u2609. After exhausting the hydrogen at the core these stars become supergiants and go on to fuse elements heavier than helium. Many end their lives when their cores collapse and they explode as supernovae.\nStar formation\n\nMain article: Star formation\n\nArtist's conception of the birth of a star within a dense molecular cloudA cluster of approximately 500 young stars lies within the nearby W40 stellar nursery.\nThe formation of a star begins with gravitational instability within a molecular cloud, caused by regions of higher density\u2014often triggered by compression of clouds by radiation from massive stars, expanding bubbles in the interstellar medium, the collision of different molecular clouds, or the collision of galaxies (as in a starburst galaxy). When a region reaches a sufficient density of matter to satisfy the criteria for Jeans instability, it begins to collapse under its own gravitational force.\nAs the cloud collapses, individual conglomerations of dense dust and gas form \"Bok globules\". As a globule collapses and the density increases, the gravitational energy converts into heat and the temperature rises. When the protostellar cloud has approximately reached the stable condition of hydrostatic equilibrium, a protostar forms at the core. These pre-main-sequence stars are often surrounded by a protoplanetary disk and powered mainly by the conversion of gravitational energy. The period of gravitational contraction lasts about 10\u00a0million years for a star like the sun, up to 100\u00a0million years for a red dwarf.\nEarly stars of less than 2\u00a0M\u2609 are called T Tauri stars, while those with greater mass are Herbig Ae/Be stars. These newly formed stars emit jets of gas along their axis of rotation, which may reduce the angular momentum of the collapsing star and result in small patches of nebulosity known as Herbig\u2013Haro objects.\nThese jets, in combination with radiation from nearby massive stars, may help to drive away the surrounding cloud from which the star was formed.\nEarly in their development, T Tauri stars follow the Hayashi track\u2014they contract and decrease in luminosity while remaining at roughly the same temperature. Less massive T Tauri stars follow this track to the main sequence, while more massive stars turn onto the Henyey track.\nMost stars are observed to be members of binary star systems, and the properties of those binaries are the result of the conditions in which they formed. A gas cloud must lose its angular momentum in order to collapse and form a star. The fragmentation of the cloud into multiple stars distributes some of that angular momentum. The primordial binaries transfer some angular momentum by gravitational interactions during close encounters with other stars in young stellar clusters. These interactions tend to split apart more widely separated (soft) binaries while causing hard binaries to become more tightly bound. This produces the separation of binaries into their two observed populations distributions.\nMain sequence\n\nMain article: Main sequence\nStars spend about 90% of their lifetimes fusing hydrogen into helium in high-temperature-and-pressure reactions in their cores. Such stars are said to be on the main sequence and are called dwarf stars. Starting at zero-age main sequence, the proportion of helium in a star's core will steadily increase, the rate of nuclear fusion at the core will slowly increase, as will the star's temperature and luminosity.\nThe Sun, for example, is estimated to have increased in luminosity by about 40% since it reached the main sequence 4.6\u00a0billion (4.6\u00d710) years ago.\nEvery star generates a stellar wind of particles that causes a continual outflow of gas into space. For most stars, the mass lost is negligible. The Sun loses 10\u00a0M\u2609 every year, or about 0.01% of its total mass over its entire lifespan. However, very massive stars can lose 10 to 10\u00a0M\u2609 each year, significantly affecting their evolution. Stars that begin with more than 50\u00a0M\u2609 can lose over half their total mass while on the main sequence.\nAn example of a Hertzsprung\u2013Russell diagram for a set of stars that includes the Sun (center) (see Classification)\nThe time a star spends on the main sequence depends primarily on the amount of fuel it has and the rate at which it fuses it. The Sun is expected to live 10\u00a0billion (10) years. Massive stars consume their fuel very rapidly and are short-lived. Low mass stars consume their fuel very slowly. Stars less massive than 0.25\u00a0M\u2609, called red dwarfs, are able to fuse nearly all of their mass while stars of about 1\u00a0M\u2609 can only fuse about 10% of their mass. The combination of their slow fuel-consumption and relatively large usable fuel supply allows low mass stars to last about one trillion (10\u00d710) years; the most extreme of 0.08\u00a0M\u2609 will last for about 12\u00a0trillion years. Red dwarfs become hotter and more luminous as they accumulate helium. When they eventually run out of hydrogen, they contract into a white dwarf and decline in temperature. Since the lifespan of such stars is greater than the current age of the universe (13.8\u00a0billion years), no stars under about 0.85\u00a0M\u2609 are expected to have moved off the main sequence.\nBesides mass, the elements heavier than helium can play a significant role in the evolution of stars. Astronomers label all elements heavier than helium \"metals\", and call the chemical concentration of these elements in a star, its metallicity. A star's metallicity can influence the time the star takes to burn its fuel, and controls the formation of its magnetic fields, which affects the strength of its stellar wind. Older, population II stars have substantially less metallicity than the younger, population I stars due to the composition of the molecular clouds from which they formed. Over time, such clouds become increasingly enriched in heavier elements as older stars die and shed portions of their atmospheres.\nPost\u2013main sequence\n\nMain articles: Subgiant, Red giant, Horizontal branch, Red clump, and Asymptotic giant branch\nBetelgeuse as seen by ALMA. This is the first time that ALMA has observed the surface of a star and resulted in the highest-resolution image of Betelgeuse available.\nAs stars of at least 0.4\u00a0M\u2609 exhaust the supply of hydrogen at their core, they start to fuse hydrogen in a shell surrounding the helium core. The outer layers of the star expand and cool greatly as they transition into a red giant. In some cases, they will fuse heavier elements at the core or in shells around the core. As the stars expand, they throw part of their mass, enriched with those heavier elements, into the interstellar environment, to be recycled later as new stars. In about 5\u00a0billion years, when the Sun enters the helium burning phase, it will expand to a maximum radius of roughly 1 astronomical unit (150\u00a0million kilometres), 250 times its present size, and lose 30% of its current mass.\nAs the hydrogen-burning shell produces more helium, the core increases in mass and temperature. In a red giant of up to 2.25\u00a0M\u2609, the mass of the helium core becomes degenerate prior to helium fusion. Finally, when the temperature increases sufficiently, core helium fusion begins explosively in what is called a helium flash, and the star rapidly shrinks in radius, increases its surface temperature, and moves to the horizontal branch of the HR diagram. For more massive stars, helium core fusion starts before the core becomes degenerate, and the star spends some time in the red clump, slowly burning helium, before the outer convective envelope collapses and the star then moves to the horizontal branch.\nAfter a star has fused the helium of its core, it begins fusing helium along a shell surrounding the hot carbon core. The star then follows an evolutionary path called the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) that parallels the other described red-giant phase, but with a higher luminosity. The more massive AGB stars may undergo a brief period of carbon fusion before the core becomes degenerate. During the AGB phase, stars undergo thermal pulses due to instabilities in the core of the star. In these thermal pulses, the luminosity of the star varies and matter is ejected from the star's atmosphere, ultimately forming a planetary nebula. As much as 50 to 70% of a star's mass can be ejected in this mass loss process. Because energy transport in an AGB star is primarily by convection, this ejected material is enriched with the fusion products dredged up from the core. Therefore, the planetary nebula is enriched with elements like carbon and oxygen. Ultimately, the planetary nebula disperses, enriching the general interstellar medium. Therefore, future generations of stars are made of the \"star stuff\" from past stars.\nMassive stars\n\nMain articles: Supergiant star, Hypergiant, and Wolf\u2013Rayet star\nOnion-like layers at the core of a massive, evolved star just before core collapses\nDuring their helium-burning phase, a star of more than 9 solar masses expands to form first a blue supergiant and then a red supergiant. Particularly massive stars may evolve to a Wolf\u2013Rayet star, characterised by spectra dominated by emission lines of elements heavier than hydrogen, which have reached the surface due to strong convection and intense mass loss, or from stripping of the outer layers.\nWhen helium is exhausted at the core of a massive star, the core contracts and the temperature and pressure rises enough to fuse carbon (see Carbon-burning process). This process continues, with the successive stages being fueled by neon (see neon-burning process), oxygen (see oxygen-burning process), and silicon (see silicon-burning process). Near the end of the star's life, fusion continues along a series of onion-layer shells within a massive star. Each shell fuses a different element, with the outermost shell fusing hydrogen; the next shell fusing helium, and so forth.\nThe final stage occurs when a massive star begins producing iron. Since iron nuclei are more tightly bound than any heavier nuclei, any fusion beyond iron does not produce a net release of energy.\nCollapse\nAs a star's core shrinks, the intensity of radiation from that surface increases, creating such radiation pressure on the outer shell of gas that it will push those layers away, forming a planetary nebula. If what remains after the outer atmosphere has been shed is less than roughly 1.4\u00a0M\u2609, it shrinks to a relatively tiny object about the size of Earth, known as a white dwarf. White dwarfs lack the mass for further gravitational compression to take place. The electron-degenerate matter inside a white dwarf is no longer a plasma. Eventually, white dwarfs fade into black dwarfs over a very long period of time.\nThe Crab Nebula, remnants of a supernova that was first observed around 1050 AD\nIn massive stars, fusion continues until the iron core has grown so large (more than 1.4\u00a0M\u2609) that it can no longer support its own mass. This core will suddenly collapse as its electrons are driven into its protons, forming neutrons, neutrinos, and gamma rays in a burst of electron capture and inverse beta decay. The shockwave formed by this sudden collapse causes the rest of the star to explode in a supernova. Supernovae become so bright that they may briefly outshine the star's entire home galaxy. When they occur within the Milky Way, supernovae have historically been observed by naked-eye observers as \"new stars\" where none seemingly existed before.\nA supernova explosion blows away the star's outer layers, leaving a remnant such as the Crab Nebula. The core is compressed into a neutron star, which sometimes manifests itself as a pulsar or X-ray burster. In the case of the largest stars, the remnant is a black hole greater than 4\u00a0M\u2609. In a neutron star the matter is in a state known as neutron-degenerate matter, with a more exotic form of degenerate matter, QCD matter, possibly present in the core.\nThe blown-off outer layers of dying stars include heavy elements, which may be recycled during the formation of new stars. These heavy elements allow the formation of rocky planets. The outflow from supernovae and the stellar wind of large stars play an important part in shaping the interstellar medium.\nBinary stars\nBinary stars' evolution may significantly differ from that of single stars of the same mass. For example, when any star expands to become a red giant, it may overflow its Roche lobe, the surrounding region where material is gravitationally bound to it; if stars in a binary system are close enough, some of that material may overflow to the other star, yielding phenomena including contact binaries, common-envelope binaries, cataclysmic variables, blue stragglers, and type Ia supernovae. Mass transfer leads to cases such as the Algol paradox, where the most-evolved star in a system is the least massive.\nThe evolution of binary star and higher-order star systems is intensely researched since so many stars have been found to be members of binary systems. Around half of Sun-like stars, and an even higher proportion of more massive stars, form in multiple systems, and this may greatly influence such phenomena as novae and supernovae, the formation of certain types of star, and the enrichment of space with nucleosynthesis products.\nThe influence of binary star evolution on the formation of evolved massive stars such as luminous blue variables, Wolf\u2013Rayet stars, and the progenitors of certain classes of core collapse supernova is still disputed. Single massive stars may be unable to expel their outer layers fast enough to form the types and numbers of evolved stars that are observed, or to produce progenitors that would explode as the supernovae that are observed. Mass transfer through gravitational stripping in binary systems is seen by some astronomers as the solution to that problem.\n\nDistribution\nArtist's impression of the Sirius system, a white dwarf star in orbit around an A-type main-sequence star\nStars are not spread uniformly across the universe but are normally grouped into galaxies along with interstellar gas and dust. A typical large galaxy like the Milky Way contains hundreds of billions of stars. There are more than 2\u00a0trillion (10) galaxies, though most are less than 10% the mass of the Milky Way. Overall, there are likely to be between 10 and 10 stars (more stars than all the grains of sand on planet Earth). Most stars are within galaxies, but between 10 and 50% of the starlight in large galaxy clusters may come from stars outside of any galaxy.\nA multi-star system consists of two or more gravitationally bound stars that orbit each other. The simplest and most common multi-star system is a binary star, but systems of three or more stars exist. For reasons of orbital stability, such multi-star systems are often organized into hierarchical sets of binary stars. Larger groups are called star clusters. These range from loose stellar associations with only a few stars to open clusters with dozens to thousands of stars, up to enormous globular clusters with hundreds of thousands of stars. Such systems orbit their host galaxy. The stars in an open or globular cluster all formed from the same giant molecular cloud, so all members normally have similar ages and compositions.\nMany stars are observed, and most or all may have originally formed in gravitationally bound, multiple-star systems. This is particularly true for very massive O and B class stars, 80% of which are believed to be part of multiple-star systems. The proportion of single star systems increases with decreasing star mass, so that only 25% of red dwarfs are known to have stellar companions. As 85% of all stars are red dwarfs, more than two thirds of stars in the Milky Way are likely single red dwarfs.\nIn a 2017 study of the Perseus molecular cloud, astronomers found that most of the newly formed stars are in binary systems. In the model that best explained the data, all stars initially formed as binaries, though some binaries later split up and leave single stars behind.\nThis view of NGC 6397 includes stars known as blue stragglers for their location on the Hertzsprung\u2013Russell diagram.\nThe nearest star to the Earth, apart from the Sun, is Proxima Centauri, 4.2465 light-years (40.175\u00a0trillion kilometres) away. Travelling at the orbital speed of the Space Shuttle, 8 kilometres per second (29,000 kilometres per hour), it would take about 150,000 years to arrive. This is typical of stellar separations in galactic discs. Stars can be much closer to each other in the centres of galaxies and in globular clusters, or much farther apart in galactic halos.\nDue to the relatively vast distances between stars outside the galactic nucleus, collisions between stars are thought to be rare. In denser regions such as the core of globular clusters or the galactic center, collisions can be more common. Such collisions can produce what are known as blue stragglers. These abnormal stars have a higher surface temperature and thus are bluer than stars at the main sequence turnoff in the cluster to which they belong; in standard stellar evolution, blue stragglers would already have evolved off the main sequence and thus would not be seen in the cluster.\n\nCharacteristics\nAlmost everything about a star is determined by its initial mass, including such characteristics as luminosity, size, evolution, lifespan, and its eventual fate.\nAge\n\nMain article: Stellar age estimation\nMost stars are between 1\u00a0billion and 10\u00a0billion years old. Some stars may even be close to 13.8\u00a0billion years old\u2014the observed age of the universe. The oldest star yet discovered, HD 140283, nicknamed Methuselah star, is an estimated 14.46 \u00b1 0.8\u00a0billion years old. (Due to the uncertainty in the value, this age for the star does not conflict with the age of the universe, determined by the Planck satellite as 13.799 \u00b1 0.021).\nThe more massive the star, the shorter its lifespan, primarily because massive stars have greater pressure on their cores, causing them to burn hydrogen more rapidly. The most massive stars last an average of a few million years, while stars of minimum mass (red dwarfs) burn their fuel very slowly and can last tens to hundreds of billions of years.\nLifetimes of stages of stellar evolution in billions of years\n\n\nInitial Mass (M\u2609)\n\nMain Sequence\n\nSubgiant\n\nFirst Red Giant\n\nCore He Burning\n\n\n1.0\n9.33\n2.57\n0.76\n0.13\n\n\n1.6\n2.28\n0.03\n0.12\n0.13\n\n\n2.0\n1.20\n0.01\n0.02\n0.28\n\n\n5.0\n0.10\n0.0004\n0.0003\n0.02\nChemical composition\n\nSee also: Metallicity and Molecules in stars\nWhen stars form in the present Milky Way galaxy, they are composed of about 71% hydrogen and 27% helium, as measured by mass, with a small fraction of heavier elements. Typically the portion of heavy elements is measured in terms of the iron content of the stellar atmosphere, as iron is a common element and its absorption lines are relatively easy to measure. The portion of heavier elements may be an indicator of the likelihood that the star has a planetary system.\nAs of 2005 the star with the lowest iron content ever measured is the dwarf HE1327-2326, with only 1/200,000th the iron content of the Sun. By contrast, the super-metal-rich star \u03bc Leonis has nearly double the abundance of iron as the Sun, while the planet-bearing star 14 Herculis has nearly triple the iron. Chemically peculiar stars show unusual abundances of certain elements in their spectrum; especially chromium and rare earth elements. Stars with cooler outer atmospheres, including the Sun, can form various diatomic and polyatomic molecules.\nDiameter\n\nMain articles: List of largest known stars, List of smallest stars, and Solar radius\nSome of the well-known stars with their apparent colors and relative sizes\nDue to their great distance from the Earth, all stars except the Sun appear to the unaided eye as shining points in the night sky that twinkle because of the effect of the Earth's atmosphere. The Sun is close enough to the Earth to appear as a disk instead, and to provide daylight. Other than the Sun, the star with the largest apparent size is R Doradus, with an angular diameter of only 0.057 arcseconds.\nThe disks of most stars are much too small in angular size to be observed with current ground-based optical telescopes, and so interferometer telescopes are required to produce images of these objects. Another technique for measuring the angular size of stars is through occultation. By precisely measuring the drop in brightness of a star as it is occulted by the Moon (or the rise in brightness when it reappears), the star's angular diameter can be computed.\nStars range in size from neutron stars, which vary anywhere from 20 to 40\u00a0km (25\u00a0mi) in diameter, to supergiants like Betelgeuse in the Orion constellation, which has a diameter about 1,000 times that of the Sun with a much lower density.\nKinematics\n\nMain article: Stellar kinematics\nThe Pleiades, an open cluster of stars in the constellation of Taurus. These stars share a common motion through space.\nThe motion of a star relative to the Sun can provide useful information about the origin and age of a star, as well as the structure and evolution of the surrounding galaxy. The components of motion of a star consist of the radial velocity toward or away from the Sun, and the traverse angular movement, which is called its proper motion.\nRadial velocity is measured by the doppler shift of the star's spectral lines and is given in units of km/s. The proper motion of a star, its parallax, is determined by precise astrometric measurements in units of milli-arc seconds (mas) per year. With knowledge of the star's parallax and its distance, the proper motion velocity can be calculated. Together with the radial velocity, the total velocity can be calculated. Stars with high rates of proper motion are likely to be relatively close to the Sun, making them good candidates for parallax measurements.\nWhen both rates of movement are known, the space velocity of the star relative to the Sun or the galaxy can be computed. Among nearby stars, it has been found that younger population I stars have generally lower velocities than older, population II stars. The latter have elliptical orbits that are inclined to the plane of the galaxy. A comparison of the kinematics of nearby stars has allowed astronomers to trace their origin to common points in giant molecular clouds, and are referred to as stellar associations.\nMagnetic field\n\nMain article: Stellar magnetic field\nSurface magnetic field of SU\u00a0Aur (a young star of T Tauri type), reconstructed by means of Zeeman\u2013Doppler imaging\nThe magnetic field of a star is generated within regions of the interior where convective circulation occurs. This movement of conductive plasma functions like a dynamo, wherein the movement of electrical charges induce magnetic fields, as does a mechanical dynamo. Those magnetic fields have a great range that extend throughout and beyond the star. The strength of the magnetic field varies with the mass and composition of the star, and the amount of magnetic surface activity depends upon the star's rate of rotation. This surface activity produces starspots, which are regions of strong magnetic fields and lower than normal surface temperatures. Coronal loops are arching magnetic field flux lines that rise from a star's surface into the star's outer atmosphere, its corona. The coronal loops can be seen due to the plasma they conduct along their length. Stellar flares are bursts of high-energy particles that are emitted due to the same magnetic activity.\nYoung, rapidly rotating stars tend to have high levels of surface activity because of their magnetic field. The magnetic field can act upon a star's stellar wind, functioning as a brake to gradually slow the rate of rotation with time. Thus, older stars such as the Sun have a much slower rate of rotation and a lower level of surface activity. The activity levels of slowly rotating stars tend to vary in a cyclical manner and can shut down altogether for periods of time. During\nthe Maunder Minimum, for example, the Sun underwent a\n70-year period with almost no sunspot activity.\nMass\n\nMain article: Stellar mass\nOne of the most massive stars known is Eta Carinae, which, with 100\u2013150\u00a0times as much mass as the Sun, will have a lifespan of only several million years. Studies of the most massive open clusters suggests 150\u00a0M\u2609 as a rough upper limit for stars in the current era of the universe. This\nrepresents an empirical value for the theoretical limit on the mass of forming stars due to increasing radiation pressure on the accreting gas cloud. Several stars in the R136 cluster in the Large Magellanic Cloud have been measured with larger masses, but\nit has been determined that they could have been created through the collision and merger of massive stars in close binary systems, sidestepping the 150\u00a0M\u2609 limit on massive star formation.\nThe reflection nebula NGC 1999 is brilliantly illuminated by V380 Orionis. The black patch of sky is a vast hole of empty space and not a dark nebula as previously thought.\nThe first stars to form after the Big Bang may have been larger, up to 300\u00a0M\u2609, due\nto the complete absence of elements heavier than lithium in their composition. This generation of supermassive population III stars is likely to have existed in the very early universe (i.e., they are observed to have a high redshift), and may have started the production of chemical elements heavier than hydrogen that are needed for the later formation of planets and life. In June 2015, astronomers reported evidence for Population III stars in the Cosmos Redshift 7 galaxy at z = 6.60.\nWith a mass only 80\u00a0times that of Jupiter (MJ), 2MASS J0523-1403 is the smallest known star undergoing nuclear fusion in its core. For\nstars with metallicity similar to the Sun, the theoretical minimum mass the star can have and still undergo fusion at the core, is estimated to be about 75 MJ. When the metallicity is very low, the minimum star size seems to be about 8.3% of the solar mass, or about 87 MJ. Smaller bodies called brown dwarfs, occupy a poorly defined grey area between stars and gas giants.\nThe combination of the radius and the mass of a star determines its surface gravity. Giant stars have a much lower surface gravity than do main sequence stars, while the opposite is the case for degenerate, compact stars such as white dwarfs. The surface gravity can influence the appearance of a star's spectrum, with higher gravity causing a broadening of the absorption lines.\nRotation\n\nMain article: Stellar rotation\nThe rotation rate of stars can be determined through spectroscopic measurement, or more exactly determined by tracking their starspots. Young stars can have a rotation greater than 100\u00a0km/s at the equator. The B-class star Achernar, for example, has an equatorial velocity of about 225\u00a0km/s or greater, causing its equator to bulge outward and giving it an equatorial diameter that is more than 50% greater than between the poles. This rate of rotation is just below the critical velocity of 300\u00a0km/s at which speed the star would break apart. By contrast, the Sun rotates once every 25\u201335 days depending on latitude, with an equatorial velocity of 1.93\u00a0km/s. A main sequence star's magnetic field and the stellar wind serve to slow its rotation by a significant amount as it evolves on the main sequence.\nDegenerate stars have contracted into a compact mass, resulting in a rapid rate of rotation. However they have relatively low rates of rotation compared to what would be expected by conservation of angular momentum\u2014the tendency of a rotating body to compensate for a contraction in size by increasing its rate of spin. A large portion of the star's angular momentum is dissipated as a result of mass loss through the stellar wind. In spite of this, the rate of rotation for a pulsar can be very rapid. The pulsar at the heart of the Crab nebula, for example, rotates 30 times per second. The rotation rate of the pulsar will gradually slow due to the emission of radiation.\nTemperature\nThe surface temperature of a main sequence star is determined by the rate of energy production of its core and by its radius, and is often estimated from the star's color index. The temperature is normally given in terms of an effective temperature, which is the temperature of an idealized black body that radiates its energy at the same luminosity per surface area as the star. The effective temperature is only representative of the surface, as the temperature increases toward the core. The temperature in the core region of a star is several million kelvins.\nThe stellar temperature will determine the rate of ionization of various elements, resulting in characteristic absorption lines in the spectrum. The surface temperature of a star, along with its visual absolute magnitude and absorption features, is used to classify a star (see classification below).\nMassive main sequence stars can have surface temperatures of 50,000\u00a0K. Smaller stars such as the Sun have surface temperatures of a few thousand K. Red giants have relatively low surface temperatures of about 3,600\u00a0K; but they have a high luminosity due to their large exterior surface area.\n\nRadiation\nThe energy produced by stars, a product of nuclear fusion, radiates to space as both electromagnetic radiation and particle radiation. The particle radiation emitted by a star is manifested as the stellar wind, which\nstreams from the outer layers as electrically charged protons and alpha and beta particles. A steady stream of almost massless neutrinos emanate directly from the star's core.\nThe production of energy at the core is the reason stars shine so brightly: every time two or more atomic nuclei fuse together to form a single atomic nucleus of a new heavier element, gamma ray photons are released from the nuclear fusion product. This energy is converted to other forms of electromagnetic energy of lower frequency, such as visible light, by the time it reaches the star's outer layers.\nThe color of a star, as determined by the most intense frequency of the visible light, depends on the temperature of the star's outer layers, including its photosphere. Besides visible light, stars emit forms of electromagnetic radiation that are invisible to the human eye. In fact, stellar electromagnetic radiation spans the entire electromagnetic spectrum, from the longest wavelengths of radio waves through infrared, visible light, ultraviolet, to the shortest of X-rays, and gamma rays. From the standpoint of total energy emitted by a star, not all components of stellar electromagnetic radiation are significant, but all frequencies provide insight into the star's physics.\nUsing the stellar spectrum, astronomers can determine the surface temperature, surface gravity, metallicity and rotational velocity of a star. If the distance of the star is found, such as by measuring the parallax, then the luminosity of the star can be derived. The mass, radius, surface gravity, and rotation period can then be estimated based on stellar models. (Mass can be calculated for stars in binary systems by measuring their orbital velocities and distances. Gravitational microlensing has been used to measure the mass of a single star.) With these parameters, astronomers can estimate the age of the star.\nLuminosity\nThe luminosity of a star is the amount of light and other forms of radiant energy it radiates per unit of time. It has units of power. The luminosity of a star is determined by its radius and surface temperature. Many stars do not radiate uniformly across their entire surface. The rapidly rotating star Vega, for example, has a higher energy flux (power per unit area) at its poles than along its equator.\nPatches of the star's surface with a lower temperature and luminosity than average are known as starspots. Small, dwarf stars such as the Sun generally have essentially featureless disks with only small starspots. Giant stars have much larger, more obvious starspots, and\nthey exhibit strong stellar limb darkening. That is, the brightness decreases towards the edge of the stellar disk. Red dwarf flare stars such as UV Ceti may possess prominent starspot features.\nMagnitude\n\nMain articles: Apparent magnitude and Absolute magnitude\nThe apparent brightness of a star is expressed in terms of its apparent magnitude. It is a function of the star's luminosity, its distance from Earth, the extinction effect of interstellar dust and gas, and the altering of the star's light as it passes through Earth's atmosphere. Intrinsic or absolute magnitude is directly related to a star's luminosity, and is the apparent magnitude a star would be if the distance between the Earth and the star were 10 parsecs (32.6 light-years).\nNumber of stars brighter than magnitude\n\n\nApparentmagnitude\n\nNumber\u00a0of\u00a0stars\n\n\n0\n\n4\n\n\n1\n\n15\n\n\n2\n\n48\n\n\n3\n\n171\n\n\n4\n\n513\n\n\n5\n\n1,602\n\n\n6\n\n4,800\n\n\n7\n\n14,000\nBoth the apparent and absolute magnitude scales are logarithmic units: one whole number difference in magnitude is equal to a brightness variation of about 2.5 times (the 5th root of 100 or approximately 2.512). This means that a first magnitude star (+1.00) is about 2.5 times brighter than a second magnitude (+2.00) star, and about 100 times brighter than a sixth magnitude star (+6.00). The faintest stars visible to the naked eye under good seeing conditions are about magnitude +6.\nOn both apparent and absolute magnitude scales, the smaller the magnitude number, the brighter the star; the larger the magnitude number, the fainter the star. The brightest stars, on either scale, have negative magnitude numbers. The variation in brightness (\u0394L) between two stars is calculated by subtracting the magnitude number of the brighter star (mb) from the magnitude number of the fainter star (mf), then using the difference as an exponent for the base number 2.512; that is to say:\n\u0394\n\nm\n\n=\n\nm\n\n\nf\n\n\n\n\u2212\n\nm\n\n\nb\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\Delta {m}=m_{\\mathrm {f} }-m_{\\mathrm {b} }}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.512\n\n\u0394\n\nm\n\n\n\n=\n\u0394\n\nL\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle 2.512^{\\Delta {m}}=\\Delta {L}}\nRelative to both luminosity and distance from Earth, a star's absolute magnitude (M) and apparent magnitude (m) are not equivalent; for example, the bright star Sirius has an apparent magnitude of \u22121.44, but it has an absolute magnitude of +1.41.\nThe Sun has an apparent magnitude of \u221226.7, but its absolute magnitude is only +4.83. Sirius, the brightest star in the night sky as seen from Earth, is approximately 23 times more luminous than the Sun, while Canopus, the second brightest star in the night sky with an absolute magnitude of \u22125.53, is approximately 14,000 times more luminous than the Sun. Despite Canopus being vastly more luminous than Sirius, the latter star appears the brighter of the two. This is because Sirius is merely 8.6 light-years from the Earth, while Canopus is much farther away at a distance of 310 light-years.\nThe most luminous known stars have absolute magnitudes of roughly \u221212, corresponding to 6\u00a0million times the luminosity of the Sun. Theoretically, the least luminous stars are at the lower limit of mass at which stars are capable of supporting nuclear fusion of hydrogen in the core; stars just above this limit have been located in the NGC 6397 cluster. The faintest red dwarfs in the cluster are absolute magnitude 15, while a 17th absolute magnitude white dwarf has been discovered.\n\nClassification\n\nMain article: Stellar classification\nSurface temperature ranges fordifferent stellar classes\n\n\nClass\n\nTemperature\n\nSample star\n\n\nO\n\n33,000\u00a0K\u00a0or\u00a0more\n\nZeta Ophiuchi\n\n\nB\n\n10,500\u201330,000\u00a0K\n\nRigel\n\n\nA\n\n7,500\u201310,000\u00a0K\n\nAltair\n\n\nF\n\n6,000\u20137,200\u00a0K\n\nProcyon\u00a0A\n\n\nG\n\n5,500\u20136,000\u00a0K\n\nSun\n\n\nK\n\n4,000\u20135,250\u00a0K\n\nEpsilon Indi\n\n\nM\n\n2,600\u20133,850\u00a0K\n\nProxima Centauri\nThe current stellar classification system originated in the early 20th century, when stars were classified from A to Q based on the strength of the hydrogen line. It was thought that the hydrogen line strength was a simple linear function of temperature. Instead, it was more complicated: it strengthened with increasing temperature, peaked near 9000\u00a0K, and then declined at greater temperatures. The classifications were since reordered by temperature, on which the modern scheme is based.\nStars are given a single-letter classification according to their spectra, ranging from type O, which are very hot, to M, which are so cool that molecules may form in their atmospheres. The main classifications in order of decreasing surface temperature are: O, B, A, F, G, K, and M. A variety of rare spectral types are given special classifications. The most common of these are types L and T, which classify the coldest low-mass stars and brown dwarfs. Each letter has 10 sub-divisions, numbered from 0 to 9, in order of decreasing temperature. However, this system breaks down at extreme high temperatures as classes O0 and O1 may not exist.\nIn addition, stars may be classified by the luminosity effects found in their spectral lines, which correspond to their spatial size and is determined by their surface gravity. These range from 0 (hypergiants) through III (giants) to V (main sequence dwarfs); some authors add VII (white dwarfs). Main sequence stars fall along a narrow, diagonal band when graphed according to their absolute magnitude and spectral type. The Sun is a main sequence G2V yellow dwarf of intermediate temperature and ordinary size.\nThere is additional nomenclature in the form of lower-case letters added to the end of the spectral type to indicate peculiar features of the spectrum. For example, an \"e\" can indicate the presence of emission lines; \"m\" represents unusually strong levels of metals, and \"var\" can mean variations in the spectral type.\nWhite dwarf stars have their own class that begins with the letter D. This is further sub-divided into the classes DA, DB, DC, DO, DZ, and DQ, depending on the types of prominent lines found in the spectrum. This is followed by a numerical value that indicates the temperature.\n\nVariable stars\n\nMain article: Variable star\nThe asymmetrical appearance of Mira, an oscillating variable star\nVariable stars have periodic or random changes in luminosity because of intrinsic or extrinsic properties. Of the intrinsically variable stars, the primary types can be subdivided into three principal groups.\nDuring their stellar evolution, some stars pass through phases where they can become pulsating variables. Pulsating variable stars vary in radius and luminosity over time, expanding and contracting with periods ranging from minutes to years, depending on the size of the star. This category includes Cepheid and Cepheid-like stars, and long-period variables such as Mira.\nEruptive variables are stars that experience sudden increases in luminosity because of flares or mass ejection events. This group includes protostars, Wolf-Rayet stars, and flare stars, as well as giant and supergiant stars.\nCataclysmic or explosive variable stars are those that undergo a dramatic change in their properties. This group includes novae and supernovae. A binary star system that includes a nearby white dwarf can produce certain types of these spectacular stellar explosions, including the nova and a Type 1a supernova. The explosion is created when the white dwarf accretes hydrogen from the companion star, building up mass until the hydrogen undergoes fusion. Some novae are recurrent, having periodic outbursts of moderate amplitude.\nStars can vary in luminosity because of extrinsic factors, such as eclipsing binaries, as well as rotating stars that produce extreme starspots. A notable example of an eclipsing binary is Algol, which regularly varies in magnitude from 2.1 to 3.4 over a period of 2.87 days.\n\nStructure\n\nMain article: Stellar structure\nInternal structures of main sequence stars with masses indicated in solar masses, convection zones with arrowed cycles, and radiative zones with red flashes. Left to right, a red dwarf, a yellow dwarf, and a blue-white main sequence star\nThe interior of a stable star is in a state of hydrostatic equilibrium: the forces on any small volume almost exactly counterbalance each other. The balanced forces are inward gravitational force and an outward force due to the pressure gradient within the star. The pressure gradient is established by the temperature gradient of the plasma; the outer part of the star is cooler than the core. The temperature at the core of a main sequence or giant star is at least on the order of 10\u00a0K. The resulting temperature and pressure at the hydrogen-burning core of a main sequence star are sufficient for nuclear fusion to occur and for sufficient energy to be produced to prevent further collapse of the star.\nAs atomic nuclei are fused in the core, they emit energy in the form of gamma rays. These photons interact with the surrounding plasma, adding to the thermal energy at the core. Stars on the main sequence convert hydrogen into helium, creating a slowly but steadily increasing proportion of helium in the core. Eventually the helium content becomes predominant, and energy production ceases at the core. Instead, for stars of more than 0.4\u00a0M\u2609, fusion occurs in a slowly expanding shell around the degenerate helium core.\nIn addition to hydrostatic equilibrium, the interior of a stable star will maintain an energy balance of thermal equilibrium. There is a radial temperature gradient throughout the interior that results in a flux of energy flowing toward the exterior. The outgoing flux of energy leaving any layer within the star will exactly match the incoming flux from below.\nThe radiation zone is the region of the stellar interior where the flux of energy outward is dependent on radiative heat transfer, since convective heat transfer is inefficient in that zone. In this region the plasma will not be perturbed, and any mass motions will die out. Where this is not the case, then the plasma becomes unstable and convection will occur, forming a convection zone. This can occur, for example, in regions where very high energy fluxes occur, such as near the core or in areas with high opacity (making radiatative heat transfer inefficient) as in the outer envelope.\nThe occurrence of convection in the outer envelope of a main sequence star depends on the star's mass. Stars with several times the mass of the Sun have a convection zone deep within the interior and a radiative zone in the outer layers. Smaller stars such as the Sun are just the opposite, with the convective zone located in the outer layers. Red dwarf stars with less than 0.4\u00a0M\u2609 are convective throughout, which prevents the accumulation of a helium core. For most stars the convective zones will vary over time as the star ages and the constitution of the interior is modified.\nA cross-section of the Sun\nThe photosphere is that portion of a star that is visible to an observer. This is the layer at which the plasma of the star becomes transparent to photons of light. From here, the energy generated at the core becomes free to propagate into space. It is within the photosphere that sun spots, regions of lower than average temperature, appear.\nAbove the level of the photosphere is the stellar atmosphere. In a main sequence star such as the Sun, the lowest level of the atmosphere, just above the photosphere, is the thin chromosphere region, where spicules appear and stellar flares begin. Above this is the transition region, where the temperature rapidly increases within a distance of only 100\u00a0km (62\u00a0mi). Beyond this is the corona, a volume of super-heated plasma that can extend outward to several million kilometres. The existence of a corona appears to be dependent on a convective zone in the outer layers of the star. Despite its high temperature, the corona emits very little light, due to its low gas density. The corona region of the Sun is normally only visible during a solar eclipse.\nFrom the corona, a stellar wind of plasma particles expands outward from the star, until it interacts with the interstellar medium. For the Sun, the influence of its solar wind extends throughout a bubble-shaped region called the heliosphere.\n\nNuclear fusion reaction pathways\n\nMain article: Stellar nucleosynthesis\n\nOverview of the proton\u2013proton chainThe carbon-nitrogen-oxygen cycle\nWhen nuclei fuse, the mass of the fused product is less than the mass of the original parts. This lost mass is converted to electromagnetic energy, according to the mass\u2013energy equivalence relationship \n\n\n\nE\n=\nm\n\nc\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle E=mc^{2}}\n\n. A variety of nuclear fusion reactions take place in the cores of stars, that depend upon their mass and composition.\nThe hydrogen fusion process is temperature-sensitive, so a moderate increase in the core temperature will result in a significant increase in the fusion rate. As a result, the core temperature of main sequence stars only varies from 4\u00a0million kelvin for a small M-class star to 40\u00a0million kelvin for a massive O-class star.\nIn the Sun, with a 16-million-kelvin core, hydrogen fuses to form helium in the proton\u2013proton chain reaction:\n4H \u2192 2H + 2e + 2\u03bde(2 x 0.4 MeV)\n2e + 2e \u2192 2\u03b3 (2 x 1.0 MeV)\n2H + 2H \u2192 2He + 2\u03b3 (2 x 5.5 MeV)\n2He \u2192 He + 2H (12.9 MeV)\nThere are a couple other paths, in which He and He combine to form Be, which eventually (with the addition of another proton) yields two He, a gain of one.\nAll these reactions result in the overall reaction:\n4H \u2192 He + 2\u03b3 + 2\u03bde (26.7 MeV)\nwhere \u03b3 is a gamma ray photon, \u03bde is a neutrino, and H and He are isotopes of hydrogen and helium, respectively. The energy released by this reaction is in millions of electron volts. Each individual reaction produces only a tiny amount of energy, but because enormous numbers of these reactions occur constantly, they produce all the energy necessary to sustain the star's radiation output. In comparison, the combustion of two hydrogen gas molecules with one oxygen gas molecule releases only 5.7 eV.\nIn more massive stars, helium is produced in a cycle of reactions catalyzed by carbon called the carbon-nitrogen-oxygen cycle.\nIn evolved stars with cores at 100\u00a0million kelvin and masses between 0.5 and 10\u00a0M\u2609, helium can be transformed into carbon in the triple-alpha process that uses the intermediate element beryllium:\nHe + He + 92 keV \u2192 Be\nHe + Be + 67 keV \u2192 C\nC \u2192 C + \u03b3 + 7.4 MeV\nFor an overall reaction of:\nOverview of consecutive fusion processes in massive stars\n3He \u2192 C + \u03b3 + 7.2 MeV\nIn massive stars, heavier elements can be burned in a contracting core through the neon-burning process and oxygen-burning process. The final stage in the stellar nucleosynthesis process is the silicon-burning process that results in the production of the stable isotope iron-56. Any further fusion would be an endothermic process that consumes energy, and so further energy can only be produced through gravitational collapse.\nDuration of the main phases of fusion for a 20\u00a0M\u2609 star\n\n\nFuelmaterial\n\nTemperature(million kelvins)\n\nDensity(kg/cm)\n\nBurn duration(\u03c4 in years)\n\n\nH\n\n37\n\n0.0045\n\n8.1\u00a0million\n\n\nHe\n\n188\n\n0.97\n\n1.2\u00a0million\n\n\nC\n\n870\n\n170\n\n976\n\n\nNe\n\n1,570\n\n3,100\n\n0.6\n\n\nO\n\n1,980\n\n5,550\n\n1.25\n\n\nS/Si\n\n3,340\n\n33,400\n\n0.0315\n\n\nSee also\nFusor (astronomy)\nOutline of astronomy\nSidereal time\nStar clocks\nStar count\nStars and planetary systems in fiction"

    "content": "Hyperplasia (from ancient Greek \u1f51\u03c0\u03ad\u03c1 huper 'over' + \u03c0\u03bb\u03ac\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 plasis 'formation'), or hypergenesis, is an enlargement of an organ or tissue caused by an increase in the amount of organic tissue that results from cell proliferation. It may lead to the gross enlargement of an organ, and the term is sometimes confused with benign neoplasia or benign tumor.\nHyperplasia is a common preneoplastic response to stimulus. Microscopically, cells resemble normal cells but are increased in numbers. Sometimes cells may also be increased in size (hypertrophy). Hyperplasia is different from hypertrophy in that the adaptive cell change in hypertrophy is an increase in the size of cells, whereas hyperplasia involves an increase in the number of cells.\n\nCauses[edit]\nHyperplasia may be due to any number of causes, including proliferation of basal layer of epidermis to compensate skin loss, chronic inflammatory response, hormonal dysfunctions, or compensation for damage or disease elsewhere. Hyperplasia may be harmless and occur on a particular tissue. An example of a normal hyperplastic response would be the growth and multiplication of milk-secreting glandular cells in the breast as a response to pregnancy, thus preparing for future breast feeding.\nPerhaps the most interesting and potent effect insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF) has on the human body is its ability to cause hyperplasia, which is an actual splitting of cells. By contrast, hypertrophy is what occurs, for example, to skeletal muscle cells during weight training and is simply an increase in the size of the cells. With IGF use, one is able to cause hyperplasia which actually increases the number of muscle cells present in the tissue. Weight training enables these new cells to mature in size and strength. It is theorized that hyperplasia may also be induced through specific power output training for athletic performance, thus increasing the number of muscle fibers instead of increasing the size of a single fiber.\n\nMechanism[edit]\nHyperplasia is considered to be a physiological (normal) response to a specific stimulus, and the cells of a hyperplastic growth remain subject to normal regulatory control mechanisms. However, hyperplasia can also occur as a pathological response, if an excess of hormone or growth factor is responsible for the stimuli. Similarly to physiological hyperplasia, cells that undergo pathologic hyperplasia are controlled by growth hormones, and cease to proliferate if such stimuli are removed. This differs from neoplasia (the process underlying cancer and benign tumors), in which genetically abnormal cells manage to proliferate in a non-physiological manner which is unresponsive to normal stimuli. That being said, the effects caused by pathologic hyperplasia can provide a suitable foundation from which neoplastic cells may develop.\n\nRole in disease[edit]\nHyperplasia of certain tissues may cause disease. Pathologic hyperplasia in these tissues may occur due to infection, physiological stress or trauma, or abnormal levels of particular hormones, such as estrogen, ACTH, or cortisol.\nTypes[edit]\nSome of the more commonly known clinical forms of hyperplasia, or conditions leading to hyperplasia, include:\nBenign prostatic hyperplasia, also known as prostate enlargement.\nCushing's disease \u2013 Physiopathology of hyperplasia of adrenal cortex due to increased circulating level of ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone).\nCongenital adrenal hyperplasia \u2013 Inherited disorder of gland (adrenal).\nEndometrial hyperplasia \u2013 Hyperproliferation of the endometrium, usually in response to unopposed estrogen stimulation in the setting of polycystic ovary syndrome or exogenous administration of hormones. Atypical endometrial hyperplasia may represent an early neoplastic process which can lead to endometrial adenocarcinoma. The development of endometrial adenocarcinoma from endometrial hyperplasia is a typical example of how the effects of pathologic hyperplasia can lead to neoplasia, and females who exhibit hyperplasia of the endometrium are indeed more likely to develop cancer of these cells.\nPatient with hemihyperplasia involving the upper and lower left extremities. The leg length discrepancy can be noted by the pelvic tilt.\nHemihyperplasia \u2013 When only half (or one side) of the body is affected, sometimes generating limbs of different lengths.\nHyperplasia of the breast \u2013 \"Hyperplastic\" lesions of the breast include usual ductal hyperplasia, a focal expansion of the number of cells in a terminal breast duct, and atypical ductal hyperplasia, in which a more abnormal pattern of growth is seen, and which is associated with an increased risk of developing breast cancer.\nIntimal hyperplasia \u2013 The thickening of the tunica intima of a blood vessel as a complication of a reconstruction procedure or endarterectomy. Intimal hyperplasia is the universal response of a vessel to injury and is an important reason of late bypass graft failure, particularly in vein and synthetic vascular grafts.\nFocal epithelial hyperplasia (also known as Heck's disease) \u2013 This is a wart-like growth in the mucous tissues of the mouth or, rarely, throat that is caused by certain sub-types of the human papillomavirus (HPV). Heck's disease has not been known to cause cancer.\nMyofibre hyperplasia (also known as double-muscling) \u2013 seen in cattle, genetic mutations cause large muscles due to increased proliferation of myofibres and decreased adipose tissue.\nSebaceous hyperplasia \u2013 In this condition, small yellowish growths develop on the skin, usually on the face. This condition is neither contagious nor dangerous.\nCompensatory liver hyperplasia \u2013 The liver undergoes cellular division after acute injury, resulting in new cells that restore liver function back to baseline. Approximately 75% of the liver can be acutely damaged or resected with seemingly full regeneration through hepatocyte division, i.e., hyperplasia.

    "content": "Headache, also known as cephalalgia, is the symptom of pain in the face, head, or neck. It can occur as a migraine, tension-type headache, or cluster headache. There is an increased risk of depression in those with severe headaches.\nHeadaches can occur as a result of many conditions. There are a number of different classification systems for headaches. The most well-recognized is that of the International Headache Society, which classifies it into more than 150 types of primary and secondary headaches. Causes of headaches may include dehydration; fatigue; sleep deprivation; stress; the effects of medications (overuse) and recreational drugs, including withdrawal; viral infections; loud noises; head injury; rapid ingestion of a very cold food or beverage; and dental or sinus issues (such as sinusitis).\nTreatment of a headache depends on the underlying cause, but commonly involves pain medication (especially in case of migraine or cluster headaches). A headache is one of the most commonly experienced of all physical discomforts.\nAbout half of adults have a headache in a given year. Tension headaches are the most common, affecting about 1.6\u00a0billion people (21.8% of the population) followed by migraine headaches which affect about 848 million (11.7%).\nThere are more than 200 types of headaches. Some are harmless and some are life-threatening. The description of the headache and findings on neurological examination, determine whether additional tests are needed and what treatment is best.\nHeadaches are broadly classified as \"primary\" or \"secondary\". Primary headaches are benign, recurrent headaches not caused by underlying disease or structural problems. For example, migraine is a type of primary headache. While primary headaches may cause significant daily pain and disability, they are not dangerous from a physiological point of view. Secondary headaches are caused by an underlying disease, like an infection, head injury, vascular disorders, brain bleed, stomach irritation, or tumors. Secondary headaches can be dangerous. Certain \"red flags\" or warning signs indicate a secondary headache may be dangerous.\nNinety percent of all headaches are primary headaches. Primary headaches usually first start when people are between 20 and 40 years old. The most common types of primary headaches are migraines and tension-type headaches. They have different characteristics. Migraines typically present with pulsing head pain, nausea, photophobia (sensitivity to light) and phonophobia (sensitivity to sound). Tension-type headaches usually present with non-pulsing \"bandlike\" pressure on both sides of the head, not accompanied by other symptoms. Such kind of headaches may be further classified into-episodic and chronic tension type headaches Other very rare types of primary headaches include:\nHeadaches may be caused by problems elsewhere in the head or neck. Some of these are not harmful, such as cervicogenic headache (pain arising from the neck muscles). The excessive use of painkillers can paradoxically cause worsening painkiller headaches.\nMore serious causes of secondary headaches include the following:\nGastrointestinal disorders may cause headaches, including Helicobacter pylori infection, celiac disease, non-celiac gluten sensitivity, irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, gastroparesis, and hepatobiliary disorders. The treatment of the gastrointestinal disorders may lead to a remission or improvement of headaches.\nMigraine headaches are also associated with Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome (CVS). CVS is characterized by episodes of severe vomiting, and often occur alongside symptoms similar to those of migraine headaches (photophobia, abdominal pain, etc.).\nThe brain itself is not sensitive to pain, because it lacks pain receptors. However, several areas of the head and neck do have pain receptors and can thus sense pain. These include the extracranial arteries, middle meningeal artery, large veins, venous sinuses, cranial and spinal nerves, head and neck muscles, the meninges, falx cerebri, parts of the brainstem, eyes, ears, teeth, and lining of the mouth. Pial arteries, rather than pial veins are responsible for pain production.\nHeadaches often result from traction or irritation of the meninges and blood vessels. The pain receptors may be stimulated by head trauma or tumours and cause headaches. Blood vessel spasms, dilated blood vessels, inflammation or infection of meninges and muscular tension can also stimulate pain receptors. Once stimulated, a nociceptor sends a message up the length of the nerve fibre to the nerve cells in the brain, signalling that a part of the body hurts.\nPrimary headaches are more difficult to understand than secondary headaches. The exact mechanisms which cause migraines, tension headaches and cluster headaches are not known. There have been different hypotheses over time that attempt to explain what happens in the brain to cause these headaches.\nMigraines are currently thought to be caused by dysfunction of the nerves in the brain. Previously, migraines were thought to be caused by a primary problem with the blood vessels in the brain. This vascular theory, which was developed in the 20th century by Wolff, suggested that the aura in migraines is caused by constriction of intracranial vessels (vessels inside the brain), and the headache itself is caused by rebound dilation of extracranial vessels (vessels just outside the brain). Dilation of these extracranial blood vessels activates the pain receptors in the surrounding nerves, causing a headache. The vascular theory is no longer accepted.  Studies have shown migraine head pain is not accompanied by extracranial vasodilation, but rather only has some mild intracranial vasodilation.\nCurrently, most specialists think migraines are due to a primary problem with the nerves in the brain. Auras are thought to be caused by a wave of increased activity of neurons in the cerebral cortex (a part of the brain) known as cortical spreading depression followed by a period of depressed activity. Some people think headaches are caused by the activation of sensory nerves which release peptides or serotonin, causing inflammation in arteries, dura and  meninges and also cause some vasodilation. Triptans, medications that treat migraines, block serotonin receptors and constrict blood vessels.\nPeople who are more susceptible to experiencing migraines without headaches are those who have a family history of migraines, women, and women who are experiencing hormonal changes or are taking birth control pills or are prescribed hormone replacement therapy.\nTension headaches are thought to be caused by the activation of peripheral nerves in the head and neck muscles.\nCluster headaches involve overactivation of the trigeminal nerve and hypothalamus in the brain, but the exact cause is unknown.\nMost headaches can be diagnosed by the clinical history alone. If the symptoms described by the person sound dangerous, further testing with neuroimaging or lumbar puncture may be necessary. Electroencephalography (EEG) is not useful for headache diagnosis.\nThe first step to diagnosing a headache is to determine if the headache is old or new. A \"new headache\" can be a headache that has started recently, or a chronic headache that has changed character. For example, if a person has chronic weekly headaches with pressure on both sides of his head, and then develops a sudden severe throbbing headache on one side of his head, they have a new headache.\nIt can be challenging to differentiate between low-risk, benign headaches and high-risk, dangerous headaches since symptoms are often similar. Headaches that are possibly dangerous require further lab tests and imaging to diagnose.\nThe American College for Emergency Physicians published criteria for low-risk headaches. They are as follows:\nA number of characteristics make it more likely that the headache is due to potentially dangerous secondary causes which may be life-threatening or cause long-term damage. These \"red flag\" symptoms mean that a headache warrants further investigation with neuroimaging and lab tests.\nIn general, people complaining of their \"first\" or \"worst\" headache warrant imaging and further workup. People with progressively worsening headache also warrant imaging, as they may have a mass or a bleed that is gradually growing, pressing on surrounding structures and causing worsening pain. People with neurological findings on exam, such as weakness, also need further workup.\nThe American Headache Society recommends using \"SSNOOP\", a mnemonic to remember the red flags for identifying a secondary headache:\nOther red flag symptoms include:\nOld headaches are usually primary headaches and are not dangerous. They are most often caused by migraines or tension headaches. Migraines are often unilateral, pulsing headaches accompanied by nausea or vomiting. There may be an aura (visual symptoms, numbness or tingling) 30\u201360 minutes before the headache, warning the person of a headache. Migraines may also not have auras. Tension-type headaches usually have bilateral \"bandlike\" pressure on both sides of the head usually without nausea or vomiting. However, some symptoms from both headache groups may overlap. It is important to distinguish between the two because the treatments are different.\nThe mnemonic 'POUND' helps distinguish between migraines and tension-type headaches. POUND stands for:\nOne review article found that if 4\u20135 of the POUND characteristics are present, a migraine is 24 times as likely a diagnosis than a tension-type headache (likelihood ratio 24). If 3 characteristics of POUND are present, migraine is 3 times more likely a diagnosis than tension type headache (likelihood ratio 3). If only 2 POUND characteristics are present, tension-type headaches are 60% more likely (likelihood ratio 0.41). Another study found the following factors independently each increase the chance of migraine over tension-type headache: nausea, photophobia, phonophobia, exacerbation by physical activity, unilateral, throbbing quality, chocolate as a headache trigger, and cheese as a headache trigger.\nCluster headaches are relatively rare (1 in 1000 people) and are more common in men than women. They present with sudden onset explosive pain around one eye and are accompanied by autonomic symptoms (tearing, runny nose and red eye).\nTemporomandibular jaw pain (chronic pain in the jaw joint), and cervicogenic headache (headache caused by pain in muscles of the neck) are also possible diagnoses.\nFor chronic, unexplained headaches, keeping a headache diary can be useful for tracking symptoms and identifying triggers, such as association with menstrual cycle, exercise and food. While mobile electronic diaries for smartphones are becoming increasingly common, a recent review found most are developed with a lack of evidence base and scientific expertise.\nCephalalgiaphobia is fear of headaches or getting a headache.\nNew headaches are more likely to be dangerous secondary headaches. They can, however, simply be the first presentation of a chronic headache syndrome, like migraine or tension-type headaches.\nOne recommended diagnostic approach is as follows. If any urgent red flags are present such as visual loss, new seizures, new weakness, new confusion, further workup with imaging and possibly a lumbar puncture should be done (see red flags section for more details). If the headache is sudden onset (thunderclap headache), a computed tomography test to look for a brain bleed (subarachnoid hemorrhage) should be done. If the CT scan does not show a bleed, a lumbar puncture should be done to look for blood in the CSF, as the CT scan can be falsely negative and subarachnoid hemorrhages can be fatal. If there are signs of infection such as fever, rash, or stiff neck, a lumbar puncture to look for meningitis should be considered. If there is jaw claudication and scalp tenderness in an older person, a temporal artery biopsy to look for temporal arteritis should be performed and immediate treatment should be started.\nThe US Headache Consortium has guidelines for neuroimaging of non-acute headaches. Most old, chronic headaches do not require neuroimaging. If a person has the characteristic symptoms of a migraine, neuroimaging is not needed as it is very unlikely the person has an intracranial abnormality. If the person has neurological findings, such as weakness, on exam, neuroimaging may be considered.\nAll people who present with red flags indicating a dangerous secondary headache should receive neuroimaging. The best form of neuroimaging for these headaches is controversial. Non-contrast computerized tomography (CT) scan is usually the first step in head imaging as it is readily available in Emergency Departments and hospitals and is cheaper than MRI. Non-contrast CT is best for identifying an acute head bleed. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is best for brain tumors and problems in the posterior fossa, or back of the brain. MRI is more sensitive for identifying intracranial problems, however it can pick up brain abnormalities that are not relevant to the person's headaches.\nThe American College of Radiology recommends the following imaging tests for different specific situations:\nA lumbar puncture is a procedure in which cerebral spinal fluid is removed from the spine with a needle. A lumbar puncture is necessary to look for infection or blood in the spinal fluid. A lumbar puncture can also evaluate the pressure in the spinal column, which can be useful for people with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (usually young, obese women who have increased intracranial pressure), or other causes of increased intracranial pressure. In most cases, a CT scan should be done first.\nHeadaches are most thoroughly classified by the International Headache Society's International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD), which published the second edition in 2004. The third edition of the International Headache Classification was published in 2013 in a beta version ahead of the final version. This classification is accepted by the WHO.\nOther classification systems exist.  One of the first published attempts was in 1951. The US National Institutes of Health developed a classification system in 1962.\nThe International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD) is an in-depth hierarchical classification of headaches published by the International Headache Society. It contains explicit (operational) diagnostic criteria for headache disorders. The first version of the classification, ICHD-1, was published in 1988. The current revision, ICHD-2, was published in 2004. The classification uses numeric codes. The top, one-digit diagnostic level includes 14 headache groups. The first four of these are classified as primary headaches, groups 5-12 as secondary headaches, cranial neuralgia, central and primary facial pain and other headaches for the last two groups.\nThe ICHD-2 classification defines migraines, tension-types headaches, cluster headache and other trigeminal autonomic headache as the main types of primary headaches. Also, according to the same classification, stabbing headaches and headaches due to cough, exertion and sexual activity (sexual headache) are classified as primary headaches. The daily-persistent headaches along with the hypnic headache and thunderclap headaches are considered primary headaches as well.\nSecondary headaches are classified based on their cause and not on their symptoms. According to the ICHD-2 classification, the main types of secondary headaches include those that are due to head or neck trauma such as whiplash injury, intracranial hematoma, post craniotomy or other head or neck injury. Headaches caused by cranial or cervical vascular disorders such as ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack, non-traumatic intracranial hemorrhage, vascular malformations or arteritis are also defined as secondary headaches. This type of headache may also be caused by cerebral venous thrombosis or different intracranial vascular disorders. Other secondary headaches are those due to intracranial disorders that are not vascular such as low or high pressure of the cerebrospinal fluid pressure, non-infectious inflammatory disease, intracranial neoplasm, epileptic seizure or other types of disorders or diseases that are intracranial but that are not associated with the vasculature of the central nervous system.\nICHD-2 classifies headaches that are caused by the ingestion of a certain substance or by its withdrawal as secondary headaches as well. This type of headache may result from the overuse of some medications or exposure to some substances. HIV/AIDS, intracranial infections and systemic infections may also cause secondary headaches. The ICHD-2 system of classification includes the headaches associated with homeostasis disorders in the category of secondary headaches. This means that headaches caused by dialysis, high blood pressure, hypothyroidism, cephalalgia and even fasting are considered secondary headaches. Secondary headaches, according to the same classification system, can also be due to the injury of any of the facial structures including teeth, jaws, or temporomandibular joint. Headaches caused by psychiatric disorders such as somatization or psychotic disorders are also classified as secondary headaches.\nThe ICHD-2 classification puts cranial neuralgias and other types of neuralgia in a different category. According to this system, there are 19 types of neuralgias and headaches due to different central causes of facial pain. Moreover, the ICHD-2 includes a category that contains all the headaches that cannot be classified.\nAlthough the ICHD-2 is the most complete headache classification there is and it includes frequency in the diagnostic criteria of some types of headaches (primarily primary headaches), it does not specifically code frequency or severity which are left at the discretion of the examiner.\nThe NIH classification consists of brief definitions of a limited number of headaches.\nThe NIH system of classification is more succinct and only describes five categories of headaches. In this case, primary headaches are those that do not show organic or structural causes. According to this classification, primary headaches can only be vascular, myogenic, cervicogenic, traction, and inflammatory.\nPrimary headache syndromes have many different possible treatments. In those with chronic headaches the long term use of opioids appears to result in greater harm than benefit.\nMigraine can be somewhat improved by lifestyle changes, but most people require medicines to control their symptoms. Medications are either to prevent getting migraines, or to reduce symptoms once a migraine starts.\nPreventive medications are generally recommended when people have more than four attacks of migraine per month, headaches last longer than 12 hours or the headaches are very disabling. Possible therapies include beta blockers, antidepressants, anticonvulsants and NSAIDs. The type of preventive medicine is usually chosen based on the other symptoms the person has. For example, if the person also has depression, an antidepressant is a good choice.\nAbortive therapies for migraines may be oral, if the migraine is mild to moderate, or may require stronger medicine given intravenously or intramuscularly. Mild to moderate headaches should first be treated with acetaminophen (paracetamol) or NSAIDs, like ibuprofen. If accompanied by nausea or vomiting, an antiemetic such as metoclopramide (Reglan) can be given orally or rectally. Moderate to severe attacks should be treated first with an oral triptan, a medication that mimics serotonin (an agonist) and causes mild vasoconstriction. If accompanied by nausea and vomiting, parenteral (through a needle in the skin) triptans and antiemetics can be given.\nSphenopalatine ganglion block (SPG block, also known nasal ganglion block or pterygopalatine ganglion blocks) can abort and prevent migraines, tension headaches and cluster headaches. It was originally described by American ENT surgeon Greenfield Sluder in 1908. Both blocks and neurostimulation have been studied as treatment for headaches.\nSeveral complementary and alternative strategies can help with migraines. The American Academy of Neurology guidelines for migraine treatment in 2000 stated relaxation training, electromyographic feedback and cognitive behavioral therapy may be considered for migraine treatment, along with medications.\nTension-type headaches can usually be managed with NSAIDs (ibuprofen, naproxen, aspirin), or acetaminophen. Triptans are not helpful in tension-type headaches unless the person also has migraines. For chronic tension type headaches, amitriptyline is the only medication proven to help. Amitriptyline is a medication which treats depression and also independently treats pain. It works by blocking the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine, and also reduces muscle tenderness by a separate mechanism. Studies evaluating acupuncture for tension-type headaches have been mixed. Overall, they show that acupuncture is probably not helpful for tension-type headaches.\nAbortive therapy for cluster headaches includes subcutaneous sumatriptan (injected under the skin) and triptan nasal sprays. High flow oxygen therapy also helps with relief.\nFor people with extended periods of cluster headaches, preventive therapy can be necessary. Verapamil is recommended as first line treatment. Lithium can also be useful. For people with shorter bouts, a short course of prednisone (10 days) can be helpful. Ergotamine is useful if given 1\u20132 hours before an attack.\nTreatment of secondary headaches involves treating the underlying cause. For example, a person with meningitis will require antibiotics. A person with a brain tumor may require surgery, chemotherapy or brain radiation.\nPeripheral neuromodulation has tentative benefits in primary headaches including cluster headaches and chronic migraine. How it may work is still being looked into.\nLiterature reviews find that approximately 64\u201377% of adults have had a headache at some point in their lives.  During each year, on average, 46\u201353% of people have headaches. However, the prevalence of headache varies widely depending on how the survey was conducted, with studies finding lifetime prevalence of as low as 8% to as high as 96%.  Most of these headaches are not dangerous. Only approximately 1\u20135% of people who seek emergency treatment for headaches have a serious underlying cause.\nMore than 90% of headaches are primary headaches. Most of these primary headaches are tension headaches. Most people with tension headaches have \"episodic\" tension headaches that come and go. Only 3.3% of adults have chronic tension headaches, with headaches for more than 15 days in a month.\nApproximately 12\u201318% of people in the world have migraines. More women than men experience migraines. In Europe and North America, 5\u20139% of men experience migraines, while 12\u201325% of women experience migraines.\nCluster headaches are relatively uncommon. They affect only 1\u20133 per thousand people in the world. Cluster headaches affect approximately three times as many men as women.\nThe first recorded classification system was published by Aretaeus of Cappadocia, a medical scholar of Greco-Roman antiquity. He made a distinction between three different types of headache: i) cephalalgia, by which he indicates a sudden onset, temporary headache; ii) cephalea, referring to a chronic type of headache; and iii) heterocrania, a paroxysmal headache on one side of the head.\nAnother classification system that resembles the modern ones was published by Thomas Willis, in De Cephalalgia in 1672. In 1787 Christian Baur generally divided headaches into idiopathic (primary headaches) and symptomatic (secondary ones), and defined 84 categories.\nIn general, children experience the same types of headaches as adults do, but their symptoms may be slightly different. The diagnostic approach to headaches in children is similar to that of adults. However, young children may not be able to verbalize pain well. If a young child is fussy, they may have a headache.\nApproximately 1% of emergency department visits for children are for headache. Most of these headaches are not dangerous. The most common type of headache seen in pediatric emergency rooms is headache caused by a cold (28.5%). Other headaches diagnosed in the emergency department include post-traumatic headache (20%), headache related to a problem with a ventriculoperitoneal shunt (a device put into the brain to remove excess CSF and reduce pressure in the brain) (11.5%) and migraine (8.5%). The most common serious headaches found in children include brain bleeds (subdural hematoma, epidural hematoma), brain abscesses, meningitis and ventriculoperitoneal shunt malfunction. Only 4\u20136.9% of kids with a headache have a serious cause.\nJust as in adults, most headaches are benign, but when head pain is accompanied with other symptoms such as speech problems, muscle weakness, and loss of vision, a more serious underlying cause may exist: hydrocephalus, meningitis, encephalitis, abscess, hemorrhage, tumor, blood clots, or head trauma. In these cases, the headache evaluation may include CT scan or MRI in order to look for possible structural disorders of the central nervous system. If a child with a recurrent headache has a normal physical exam, neuroimaging is not recommended. Guidelines state children with abnormal neurologic exams, confusion, seizures and recent onset of worst headache of life, change in headache type or anything suggesting neurologic problems should receive neuroimaging.\nWhen children complain of headaches, many parents are concerned about a brain tumor. Generally, headaches caused by brain masses are incapacitating and accompanied by vomiting. One study found characteristics associated with brain tumor in children are: headache for greater than 6 months, headache related to sleep, vomiting, confusion, no visual symptoms, no family history of migraine and abnormal neurologic exam.\nSome measures can help prevent headaches in children. Drinking plenty of water throughout the day, avoiding caffeine, getting enough and regular sleep, eating balanced meals at the proper times, and reducing stress and excess of activities may prevent headaches. Treatments for children are similar to those for adults, however certain medications such as narcotics should not be given to children.\nChildren who have headaches will not necessarily have headaches as adults. In one study of 100 children with headache, eight years later 44% of those with tension headache and 28% of those with migraines were headache free. In another study of people with chronic daily headache, 75% did not have chronic daily headaches two years later, and 88% did not have chronic daily headaches eight years later.\n\nCauses[edit]\nThere are more than 200 types of headaches. Some are harmless and some are life-threatening. The description of the headache and findings on neurological examination, determine whether additional tests are needed and what treatment is best.\nHeadaches are broadly classified as \"primary\" or \"secondary\". Primary headaches are benign, recurrent headaches not caused by underlying disease or structural problems. For example, migraine is a type of primary headache. While primary headaches may cause significant daily pain and disability, they are not dangerous from a physiological point of view. Secondary headaches are caused by an underlying disease, like an infection, head injury, vascular disorders, brain bleed, stomach irritation, or tumors. Secondary headaches can be dangerous. Certain \"red flags\" or warning signs indicate a secondary headache may be dangerous.\nPrimary[edit]\nNinety percent of all headaches are primary headaches. Primary headaches usually first start when people are between 20 and 40 years old. The most common types of primary headaches are migraines and tension-type headaches. They have different characteristics. Migraines typically present with pulsing head pain, nausea, photophobia (sensitivity to light) and phonophobia (sensitivity to sound). Tension-type headaches usually present with non-pulsing \"bandlike\" pressure on both sides of the head, not accompanied by other symptoms. Such kind of headaches may be further classified into-episodic and chronic tension type headaches Other very rare types of primary headaches include:\ncluster headaches: short episodes (15\u2013180 minutes) of severe pain, usually around one eye, with autonomic symptoms (tearing, red eye, nasal congestion) which occur at the same time every day. Cluster headaches can be treated with triptans and prevented with prednisone, ergotamine or lithium.\ntrigeminal neuralgia or occipital neuralgia: shooting face pain\nhemicrania continua: continuous unilateral pain with episodes of severe pain. Hemicrania continua can be relieved by the medication indomethacin.\nprimary stabbing headache: recurrent episodes of stabbing \"ice pick pain\" or \"jabs and jolts\" for 1 second to several minutes without autonomic symptoms (tearing, red eye, nasal congestion). These headaches can be treated with indomethacin.\nprimary cough headache: starts suddenly and lasts for several minutes after coughing, sneezing or straining (anything that may increase pressure in the head). Serious causes (see secondary headaches red flag section) must be ruled out before a diagnosis of \"benign\" primary cough headache can be made.\nprimary exertional headache: throbbing, pulsatile pain which starts during or after exercising, lasting for 5 minutes to 24 hours. The mechanism behind these headaches is unclear, possibly due to straining causing veins in the head to dilate, causing pain. These headaches can be prevented by not exercising too strenuously and can be treated with medications such as indomethacin.\nprimary sex headache: dull, bilateral headache that starts during sexual activity and becomes much worse during orgasm. These headaches are thought to be due to lower pressure in the head during sex. It is important to realize that headaches that begin during orgasm may be due to a subarachnoid hemorrhage, so serious causes must be ruled out first. These headaches are treated by advising the person to stop sex if they develop a headache. Medications such as propranolol and diltiazem can also be helpful.\nhypnic headache: a moderate-severe headache that starts a few hours after falling asleep and lasts 15\u201330 minutes. The headache may recur several times during the night. Hypnic headaches are usually in older women. They may be treated with lithium.\nSecondary[edit]\nThis section needs additional citations for verification. Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources in this section. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (February 2021) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)\nHeadaches may be caused by problems elsewhere in the head or neck. Some of these are not harmful, such as cervicogenic headache (pain arising from the neck muscles). The excessive use of painkillers can paradoxically cause worsening painkiller headaches.\nMore serious causes of secondary headaches include the following:\nmeningitis: inflammation of the meninges which presents with fever and meningismus, or stiff neck\nbleeding inside the brain (intracranial hemorrhage)\nsubarachnoid hemorrhage (acute, severe headache, stiff neck without fever)\nruptured aneurysm, arteriovenous malformation, intraparenchymal hemorrhage (headache only)\nbrain tumor: dull headache, worse with exertion and change in position, accompanied by nausea and vomiting. Often, the person will have nausea and vomiting for weeks before the headache starts.\ntemporal arteritis: inflammatory disease of arteries common in the elderly (average age 70) with fever, headache, weight loss, jaw claudication, tender vessels by the temples, polymyalgia rheumatica\nacute closed-angle glaucoma (increased pressure in the eyeball): a headache that starts with eye pain, blurry vision, associated with nausea and vomiting. On physical exam, the person will have red eyes and a fixed, mid-dilated pupil.\nPost-ictal headaches: Headaches that happen after a convulsion or other type of seizure, as part of the period after the seizure (the post-ictal state)\nGastrointestinal disorders may cause headaches, including Helicobacter pylori infection, celiac disease, non-celiac gluten sensitivity, irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, gastroparesis, and hepatobiliary disorders. The treatment of the gastrointestinal disorders may lead to a remission or improvement of headaches.\nMigraine headaches are also associated with Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome (CVS). CVS is characterized by episodes of severe vomiting, and often occur alongside symptoms similar to those of migraine headaches (photophobia, abdominal pain, etc.).\n\nPathophysiology[edit]\nThe brain itself is not sensitive to pain, because it lacks pain receptors. However, several areas of the head and neck do have pain receptors and can thus sense pain. These include the extracranial arteries, middle meningeal artery, large veins, venous sinuses, cranial and spinal nerves, head and neck muscles, the meninges, falx cerebri, parts of the brainstem, eyes, ears, teeth, and lining of the mouth. Pial arteries, rather than pial veins are responsible for pain production.\nHeadaches often result from traction or irritation of the meninges and blood vessels. The pain receptors may be stimulated by head trauma or tumours and cause headaches. Blood vessel spasms, dilated blood vessels, inflammation or infection of meninges and muscular tension can also stimulate pain receptors. Once stimulated, a nociceptor sends a message up the length of the nerve fibre to the nerve cells in the brain, signalling that a part of the body hurts.\nPrimary headaches are more difficult to understand than secondary headaches. The exact mechanisms which cause migraines, tension headaches and cluster headaches are not known. There have been different hypotheses over time that attempt to explain what happens in the brain to cause these headaches.\nMigraines are currently thought to be caused by dysfunction of the nerves in the brain. Previously, migraines were thought to be caused by a primary problem with the blood vessels in the brain. This vascular theory, which was developed in the 20th century by Wolff, suggested that the aura in migraines is caused by constriction of intracranial vessels (vessels inside the brain), and the headache itself is caused by rebound dilation of extracranial vessels (vessels just outside the brain). Dilation of these extracranial blood vessels activates the pain receptors in the surrounding nerves, causing a headache. The vascular theory is no longer accepted.  Studies have shown migraine head pain is not accompanied by extracranial vasodilation, but rather only has some mild intracranial vasodilation.\nCurrently, most specialists think migraines are due to a primary problem with the nerves in the brain. Auras are thought to be caused by a wave of increased activity of neurons in the cerebral cortex (a part of the brain) known as cortical spreading depression followed by a period of depressed activity. Some people think headaches are caused by the activation of sensory nerves which release peptides or serotonin, causing inflammation in arteries, dura and  meninges and also cause some vasodilation. Triptans, medications that treat migraines, block serotonin receptors and constrict blood vessels.\nPeople who are more susceptible to experiencing migraines without headaches are those who have a family history of migraines, women, and women who are experiencing hormonal changes or are taking birth control pills or are prescribed hormone replacement therapy.\nTension headaches are thought to be caused by the activation of peripheral nerves in the head and neck muscles.\nCluster headaches involve overactivation of the trigeminal nerve and hypothalamus in the brain, but the exact cause is unknown.\n\nDiagnosis[edit]\nDifferential diagnosis of headaches\n\n\n\nTension headache\n\nNew daily persistent headache\n\nCluster headache\n\nMigraine\n\n\nmild to moderate dull or aching pain\n\nsevere pain\nmoderate to severe pain\n\n\nduration of 30 minutes to several hours\n\nduration of at least four hours daily\n\nduration of 30 minutes to 3 hours\n\nduration of 4 hours to 3 days\n\n\n\n\nOccur in periods of 15 days a month for three months\n\nmay happen multiple times in a day for months\n\nperiodic occurrence; several per month to several per year\n\n\nlocated as tightness or pressure across head\n\nlocated on one or both sides of the head\n\nlocated one side of head focused at eye or temple\n\nlocated on one or both sides of head\n\n\n\n\nconsistent pain\n\npain describable as sharp or stabbing\n\npulsating or throbbing pain\n\n\nno nausea or vomiting\n\n\n\n\n\nnausea, perhaps with vomiting\n\n\nno aura\n\nno aura\n\n\n\nauras\n\n\nuncommonly, light sensitivity or noise sensitivity\n\n\n\nmay be accompanied by running nose, tears, and drooping eyelid, often only on one side\n\nsensitivity to movement, light, and noise\n\n\n\n\nexacerbated by regular use of acetaminophen or NSAIDS\n\n\n\nmay exist with tension headache\nMost headaches can be diagnosed by the clinical history alone. If the symptoms described by the person sound dangerous, further testing with neuroimaging or lumbar puncture may be necessary. Electroencephalography (EEG) is not useful for headache diagnosis.\nThe first step to diagnosing a headache is to determine if the headache is old or new. A \"new headache\" can be a headache that has started recently, or a chronic headache that has changed character. For example, if a person has chronic weekly headaches with pressure on both sides of his head, and then develops a sudden severe throbbing headache on one side of his head, they have a new headache.\nRed flags[edit]\nIt can be challenging to differentiate between low-risk, benign headaches and high-risk, dangerous headaches since symptoms are often similar. Headaches that are possibly dangerous require further lab tests and imaging to diagnose.\nThe American College for Emergency Physicians published criteria for low-risk headaches. They are as follows:\nage younger than 30 years\nfeatures typical of primary headache\nhistory of similar headache\nno abnormal findings on neurologic exam\nno concerning change in normal headache pattern\nno high-risk comorbid conditions (for example, HIV)\nno new concerning history or physical examination findings\nA number of characteristics make it more likely that the headache is due to potentially dangerous secondary causes which may be life-threatening or cause long-term damage. These \"red flag\" symptoms mean that a headache warrants further investigation with neuroimaging and lab tests.\nIn general, people complaining of their \"first\" or \"worst\" headache warrant imaging and further workup. People with progressively worsening headache also warrant imaging, as they may have a mass or a bleed that is gradually growing, pressing on surrounding structures and causing worsening pain. People with neurological findings on exam, such as weakness, also need further workup.\nThe American Headache Society recommends using \"SSNOOP\", a mnemonic to remember the red flags for identifying a secondary headache:\nSystemic symptoms (fever or weight loss)\nSystemic disease (HIV infection, malignancy)\nNeurologic symptoms or signs\nOnset sudden (thunderclap headache)\nOnset after age 40 years\nPrevious headache history (first, worst, or different headache)\nOther red flag symptoms include:\nRed Flag\nPossible causes\nThe reason why a red flag indicates possible causes\nDiagnostic tests\n\n\nNew headache after age 50\nTemporal arteritis, mass in brain\nTemporal arteritis is an inflammation of vessels close to the temples in older people, which decreases blood flow to the brain and causes pain. May also have tenderness in temples or jaw claudication. Some brain cancers are more common in older people.\nErythrocyte sedimentation rate (diagnostic test for temporal arteritis), neuroimaging\n\n\nVery sudden onset headache (thunderclap headache)\nBrain bleed (subarachnoid hemorrhage, hemorrhage into mass lesion, vascular malformation), pituitary apoplexy, mass (especially in posterior fossa)\nA bleed in the brain irritates the meninges which causes pain. Pituitary apoplexy (bleeding or impaired blood supply to the pituitary gland at the base of the brain) is often accompanied by double vision or visual field defects, since the pituitary gland is right next to the optic chiasm (eye nerves).\nNeuroimaging, lumbar puncture if computed tomography is negative\n\n\nHeadaches increasing in frequency and severity\nMass, subdural hematoma, medication overuse\nAs a brain mass gets larger, or a subdural hematoma (blood outside the vessels underneath the dura) it pushes more on surrounding structures causing pain. Medication overuse headaches worsen with more medication taken over time.\nNeuroimaging, drug screen\n\n\nNew onset headache in a person with possible HIV or cancer\nMeningitis (chronic or carcinomatous), brain abscess including toxoplasmosis, metastasis\nPeople with HIV or cancer are immunosuppressed so are likely to get infections of the meninges or infections in the brain causing abscesses. Cancer can metastasize, or travel through the blood or lymph to other sites in the body.\nNeuroimaging, lumbar puncture if neuroimaging is negative\n\n\nHeadache with signs of total body illness (fever, stiff neck, rash)\nMeningitis, encephalitis (inflammation of the brain tissue), Lyme disease, collagen vascular disease\nA stiff neck, or inability to flex the neck due to pain, indicates inflammation of the meninges. Other signs of systemic illness indicates infection.\nNeuroimaging, lumbar puncture, serology (diagnostic blood tests for infections)\n\n\nPapilledema\nBrain mass, benign intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri), meningitis\nIncreased intracranial pressure pushes on the eyes (from inside the brain) and causes papilledema.\nNeuroimaging, lumbar puncture\n\n\nSevere headache following head trauma\nBrain bleeds (intracranial hemorrhage, subdural hematoma, epidural hematoma), post-traumatic headache\nTrauma can cause bleeding in the brain or shake the nerves, causing a post-traumatic headache\nNeuroimaging of brain, skull, and possibly cervical spine\n\n\nInability to move a limb\nArteriovenous malformation, collagen vascular disease, intracranial mass lesion\nFocal neurological signs indicate something is pushing against nerves in the brain responsible for one part of the body\nNeuroimaging, blood tests for collagen vascular diseases\n\n\nChange in personality, consciousness, or mental status\nCentral nervous system infection, intracranial bleed, mass\nChange in mental status indicates a global infection or inflammation of the brain, or a large bleed compressing the brainstem where the consciousness centers lie\nBlood tests, lumbar puncture, neuroimaging\n\n\nHeadache triggered by cough, exertion or while engaged in sexual intercourse\nMass lesion, subarachnoid hemorrhage\nCoughing and exertion increases the intra cranial pressure, which may cause a vessel to burst, causing a subarachnoid hemorrhage. A mass lesion already increases intracranial pressure, so an additional increase in intracranial pressure from coughing etc. will cause pain.\nNeuroimaging, lumbar puncture\nOld headaches[edit]\nOld headaches are usually primary headaches and are not dangerous. They are most often caused by migraines or tension headaches. Migraines are often unilateral, pulsing headaches accompanied by nausea or vomiting. There may be an aura (visual symptoms, numbness or tingling) 30\u201360 minutes before the headache, warning the person of a headache. Migraines may also not have auras. Tension-type headaches usually have bilateral \"bandlike\" pressure on both sides of the head usually without nausea or vomiting. However, some symptoms from both headache groups may overlap. It is important to distinguish between the two because the treatments are different.\nThe mnemonic 'POUND' helps distinguish between migraines and tension-type headaches. POUND stands for:\nPulsatile quality of headacheOne-day duration (four to 72 hours)Unilateral locationNausea or vomitingDisabling intensity\nOne review article found that if 4\u20135 of the POUND characteristics are present, a migraine is 24 times as likely a diagnosis than a tension-type headache (likelihood ratio 24). If 3 characteristics of POUND are present, migraine is 3 times more likely a diagnosis than tension type headache (likelihood ratio 3). If only 2 POUND characteristics are present, tension-type headaches are 60% more likely (likelihood ratio 0.41). Another study found the following factors independently each increase the chance of migraine over tension-type headache: nausea, photophobia, phonophobia, exacerbation by physical activity, unilateral, throbbing quality, chocolate as a headache trigger, and cheese as a headache trigger.\nCluster headaches are relatively rare (1 in 1000 people) and are more common in men than women. They present with sudden onset explosive pain around one eye and are accompanied by autonomic symptoms (tearing, runny nose and red eye).\nTemporomandibular jaw pain (chronic pain in the jaw joint), and cervicogenic headache (headache caused by pain in muscles of the neck) are also possible diagnoses.\nFor chronic, unexplained headaches, keeping a headache diary can be useful for tracking symptoms and identifying triggers, such as association with menstrual cycle, exercise and food. While mobile electronic diaries for smartphones are becoming increasingly common, a recent review found most are developed with a lack of evidence base and scientific expertise.\nCephalalgiaphobia is fear of headaches or getting a headache.\nNew headaches[edit]\nNew headaches are more likely to be dangerous secondary headaches. They can, however, simply be the first presentation of a chronic headache syndrome, like migraine or tension-type headaches.\nOne recommended diagnostic approach is as follows. If any urgent red flags are present such as visual loss, new seizures, new weakness, new confusion, further workup with imaging and possibly a lumbar puncture should be done (see red flags section for more details). If the headache is sudden onset (thunderclap headache), a computed tomography test to look for a brain bleed (subarachnoid hemorrhage) should be done. If the CT scan does not show a bleed, a lumbar puncture should be done to look for blood in the CSF, as the CT scan can be falsely negative and subarachnoid hemorrhages can be fatal. If there are signs of infection such as fever, rash, or stiff neck, a lumbar puncture to look for meningitis should be considered. If there is jaw claudication and scalp tenderness in an older person, a temporal artery biopsy to look for temporal arteritis should be performed and immediate treatment should be started.\nNeuroimaging[edit]\nOld headaches[edit]\nThe US Headache Consortium has guidelines for neuroimaging of non-acute headaches. Most old, chronic headaches do not require neuroimaging. If a person has the characteristic symptoms of a migraine, neuroimaging is not needed as it is very unlikely the person has an intracranial abnormality. If the person has neurological findings, such as weakness, on exam, neuroimaging may be considered.\nNew headaches[edit]\nAll people who present with red flags indicating a dangerous secondary headache should receive neuroimaging. The best form of neuroimaging for these headaches is controversial. Non-contrast computerized tomography (CT) scan is usually the first step in head imaging as it is readily available in Emergency Departments and hospitals and is cheaper than MRI. Non-contrast CT is best for identifying an acute head bleed. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is best for brain tumors and problems in the posterior fossa, or back of the brain. MRI is more sensitive for identifying intracranial problems, however it can pick up brain abnormalities that are not relevant to the person's headaches.\nThe American College of Radiology recommends the following imaging tests for different specific situations:\nClinical Features\nRecommended neuroimaging test\n\n\nHeadache in immunocompromised people (cancer, HIV)\nMRI of head with or without contrast\n\n\nHeadache in people older than 60 with suspected temporal arteritis\nMRI of head with or without contrast\n\n\nHeadache with suspected meningitis\nCT or MRI without contrast\n\n\nSevere headache in pregnancy\nCT or MRI without contrast\n\n\nSevere unilateral headache caused by possible dissection of carotid or arterial arteries\nMRI of head with or without contrast, magnetic resonance angiography or Computed Tomography Angiography of head and neck.\n\n\nSudden onset headache or worst headache of life\nCT of head without contrast, Computed Tomography Angiography of head and neck with contrast, magnetic resonance angiography of head and neck with and without contrast, MRI of head without contrast\nLumbar puncture[edit]\nA lumbar puncture is a procedure in which cerebral spinal fluid is removed from the spine with a needle. A lumbar puncture is necessary to look for infection or blood in the spinal fluid. A lumbar puncture can also evaluate the pressure in the spinal column, which can be useful for people with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (usually young, obese women who have increased intracranial pressure), or other causes of increased intracranial pressure. In most cases, a CT scan should be done first.\nClassification[edit]\nHeadaches are most thoroughly classified by the International Headache Society's International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD), which published the second edition in 2004. The third edition of the International Headache Classification was published in 2013 in a beta version ahead of the final version. This classification is accepted by the WHO.\nOther classification systems exist.  One of the first published attempts was in 1951. The US National Institutes of Health developed a classification system in 1962.\nICHD-2[edit]\n\nMain article: International Classification of Headache Disorders\nThe International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD) is an in-depth hierarchical classification of headaches published by the International Headache Society. It contains explicit (operational) diagnostic criteria for headache disorders. The first version of the classification, ICHD-1, was published in 1988. The current revision, ICHD-2, was published in 2004. The classification uses numeric codes. The top, one-digit diagnostic level includes 14 headache groups. The first four of these are classified as primary headaches, groups 5-12 as secondary headaches, cranial neuralgia, central and primary facial pain and other headaches for the last two groups.\nThe ICHD-2 classification defines migraines, tension-types headaches, cluster headache and other trigeminal autonomic headache as the main types of primary headaches. Also, according to the same classification, stabbing headaches and headaches due to cough, exertion and sexual activity (sexual headache) are classified as primary headaches. The daily-persistent headaches along with the hypnic headache and thunderclap headaches are considered primary headaches as well.\nSecondary headaches are classified based on their cause and not on their symptoms. According to the ICHD-2 classification, the main types of secondary headaches include those that are due to head or neck trauma such as whiplash injury, intracranial hematoma, post craniotomy or other head or neck injury. Headaches caused by cranial or cervical vascular disorders such as ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack, non-traumatic intracranial hemorrhage, vascular malformations or arteritis are also defined as secondary headaches. This type of headache may also be caused by cerebral venous thrombosis or different intracranial vascular disorders. Other secondary headaches are those due to intracranial disorders that are not vascular such as low or high pressure of the cerebrospinal fluid pressure, non-infectious inflammatory disease, intracranial neoplasm, epileptic seizure or other types of disorders or diseases that are intracranial but that are not associated with the vasculature of the central nervous system.\nICHD-2 classifies headaches that are caused by the ingestion of a certain substance or by its withdrawal as secondary headaches as well. This type of headache may result from the overuse of some medications or exposure to some substances. HIV/AIDS, intracranial infections and systemic infections may also cause secondary headaches. The ICHD-2 system of classification includes the headaches associated with homeostasis disorders in the category of secondary headaches. This means that headaches caused by dialysis, high blood pressure, hypothyroidism, cephalalgia and even fasting are considered secondary headaches. Secondary headaches, according to the same classification system, can also be due to the injury of any of the facial structures including teeth, jaws, or temporomandibular joint. Headaches caused by psychiatric disorders such as somatization or psychotic disorders are also classified as secondary headaches.\nThe ICHD-2 classification puts cranial neuralgias and other types of neuralgia in a different category. According to this system, there are 19 types of neuralgias and headaches due to different central causes of facial pain. Moreover, the ICHD-2 includes a category that contains all the headaches that cannot be classified.\nAlthough the ICHD-2 is the most complete headache classification there is and it includes frequency in the diagnostic criteria of some types of headaches (primarily primary headaches), it does not specifically code frequency or severity which are left at the discretion of the examiner.\nNIH[edit]\n\nMain article: NIH classification of headaches\nThe NIH classification consists of brief definitions of a limited number of headaches.\nThe NIH system of classification is more succinct and only describes five categories of headaches. In this case, primary headaches are those that do not show organic or structural causes. According to this classification, primary headaches can only be vascular, myogenic, cervicogenic, traction, and inflammatory.\n\nManagement[edit]\nAn old advertisement for a headache medicine\n\nSee also: Management of chronic headaches\nPrimary headache syndromes have many different possible treatments. In those with chronic headaches the long term use of opioids appears to result in greater harm than benefit.\nMigraines[edit]\nMigraine can be somewhat improved by lifestyle changes, but most people require medicines to control their symptoms. Medications are either to prevent getting migraines, or to reduce symptoms once a migraine starts.\nPreventive medications are generally recommended when people have more than four attacks of migraine per month, headaches last longer than 12 hours or the headaches are very disabling. Possible therapies include beta blockers, antidepressants, anticonvulsants and NSAIDs. The type of preventive medicine is usually chosen based on the other symptoms the person has. For example, if the person also has depression, an antidepressant is a good choice.\nAbortive therapies for migraines may be oral, if the migraine is mild to moderate, or may require stronger medicine given intravenously or intramuscularly. Mild to moderate headaches should first be treated with acetaminophen (paracetamol) or NSAIDs, like ibuprofen. If accompanied by nausea or vomiting, an antiemetic such as metoclopramide (Reglan) can be given orally or rectally. Moderate to severe attacks should be treated first with an oral triptan, a medication that mimics serotonin (an agonist) and causes mild vasoconstriction. If accompanied by nausea and vomiting, parenteral (through a needle in the skin) triptans and antiemetics can be given.\nSphenopalatine ganglion block (SPG block, also known nasal ganglion block or pterygopalatine ganglion blocks) can abort and prevent migraines, tension headaches and cluster headaches. It was originally described by American ENT surgeon Greenfield Sluder in 1908. Both blocks and neurostimulation have been studied as treatment for headaches.\nSeveral complementary and alternative strategies can help with migraines. The American Academy of Neurology guidelines for migraine treatment in 2000 stated relaxation training, electromyographic feedback and cognitive behavioral therapy may be considered for migraine treatment, along with medications.\nTension-type headaches[edit]\nTension-type headaches can usually be managed with NSAIDs (ibuprofen, naproxen, aspirin), or acetaminophen. Triptans are not helpful in tension-type headaches unless the person also has migraines. For chronic tension type headaches, amitriptyline is the only medication proven to help. Amitriptyline is a medication which treats depression and also independently treats pain. It works by blocking the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine, and also reduces muscle tenderness by a separate mechanism. Studies evaluating acupuncture for tension-type headaches have been mixed. Overall, they show that acupuncture is probably not helpful for tension-type headaches.\nCluster headaches[edit]\nAbortive therapy for cluster headaches includes subcutaneous sumatriptan (injected under the skin) and triptan nasal sprays. High flow oxygen therapy also helps with relief.\nFor people with extended periods of cluster headaches, preventive therapy can be necessary. Verapamil is recommended as first line treatment. Lithium can also be useful. For people with shorter bouts, a short course of prednisone (10 days) can be helpful. Ergotamine is useful if given 1\u20132 hours before an attack.\nSecondary headaches[edit]\nTreatment of secondary headaches involves treating the underlying cause. For example, a person with meningitis will require antibiotics. A person with a brain tumor may require surgery, chemotherapy or brain radiation.\nNeuromodulation[edit]\nPeripheral neuromodulation has tentative benefits in primary headaches including cluster headaches and chronic migraine. How it may work is still being looked into.\n\nEpidemiology[edit]\nLiterature reviews find that approximately 64\u201377% of adults have had a headache at some point in their lives.  During each year, on average, 46\u201353% of people have headaches. However, the prevalence of headache varies widely depending on how the survey was conducted, with studies finding lifetime prevalence of as low as 8% to as high as 96%.  Most of these headaches are not dangerous. Only approximately 1\u20135% of people who seek emergency treatment for headaches have a serious underlying cause.\nMore than 90% of headaches are primary headaches. Most of these primary headaches are tension headaches. Most people with tension headaches have \"episodic\" tension headaches that come and go. Only 3.3% of adults have chronic tension headaches, with headaches for more than 15 days in a month.\nApproximately 12\u201318% of people in the world have migraines. More women than men experience migraines. In Europe and North America, 5\u20139% of men experience migraines, while 12\u201325% of women experience migraines.\nCluster headaches are relatively uncommon. They affect only 1\u20133 per thousand people in the world. Cluster headaches affect approximately three times as many men as women.\n\nHistory[edit]\nAn 1819 caricature by George Cruikshank depicting a headache\nThe first recorded classification system was published by Aretaeus of Cappadocia, a medical scholar of Greco-Roman antiquity. He made a distinction between three different types of headache: i) cephalalgia, by which he indicates a sudden onset, temporary headache; ii) cephalea, referring to a chronic type of headache; and iii) heterocrania, a paroxysmal headache on one side of the head.\nAnother classification system that resembles the modern ones was published by Thomas Willis, in De Cephalalgia in 1672. In 1787 Christian Baur generally divided headaches into idiopathic (primary headaches) and symptomatic (secondary ones), and defined 84 categories.\n\nChildren[edit]\nIn general, children experience the same types of headaches as adults do, but their symptoms may be slightly different. The diagnostic approach to headaches in children is similar to that of adults. However, young children may not be able to verbalize pain well. If a young child is fussy, they may have a headache.\nApproximately 1% of emergency department visits for children are for headache. Most of these headaches are not dangerous. The most common type of headache seen in pediatric emergency rooms is headache caused by a cold (28.5%). Other headaches diagnosed in the emergency department include post-traumatic headache (20%), headache related to a problem with a ventriculoperitoneal shunt (a device put into the brain to remove excess CSF and reduce pressure in the brain) (11.5%) and migraine (8.5%). The most common serious headaches found in children include brain bleeds (subdural hematoma, epidural hematoma), brain abscesses, meningitis and ventriculoperitoneal shunt malfunction. Only 4\u20136.9% of kids with a headache have a serious cause.\nJust as in adults, most headaches are benign, but when head pain is accompanied with other symptoms such as speech problems, muscle weakness, and loss of vision, a more serious underlying cause may exist: hydrocephalus, meningitis, encephalitis, abscess, hemorrhage, tumor, blood clots, or head trauma. In these cases, the headache evaluation may include CT scan or MRI in order to look for possible structural disorders of the central nervous system. If a child with a recurrent headache has a normal physical exam, neuroimaging is not recommended. Guidelines state children with abnormal neurologic exams, confusion, seizures and recent onset of worst headache of life, change in headache type or anything suggesting neurologic problems should receive neuroimaging.\nWhen children complain of headaches, many parents are concerned about a brain tumor. Generally, headaches caused by brain masses are incapacitating and accompanied by vomiting. One study found characteristics associated with brain tumor in children are: headache for greater than 6 months, headache related to sleep, vomiting, confusion, no visual symptoms, no family history of migraine and abnormal neurologic exam.\nSome measures can help prevent headaches in children. Drinking plenty of water throughout the day, avoiding caffeine, getting enough and regular sleep, eating balanced meals at the proper times, and reducing stress and excess of activities may prevent headaches. Treatments for children are similar to those for adults, however certain medications such as narcotics should not be given to children.\nChildren who have headaches will not necessarily have headaches as adults. In one study of 100 children with headache, eight years later 44% of those with tension headache and 28% of those with migraines were headache free. In another study of people with chronic daily headache, 75% did not have chronic daily headaches two years later, and 88% did not have chronic daily headaches eight years later.\n\nSee also[edit]\nEye strain"

An object that goes through brain tissue, such as a bullet or shattered piece of skull, also can cause traumatic brain injury.\n\nMild traumatic brain injury may affect your brain cells temporarily. More-serious traumatic brain injury can result in bruising, torn tissues, bleeding and other physical damage to the brain. These injuries can result in long-term complications or death.\n\nProducts & Services\nA Book: Guide to the Comatose Patient\nSymptoms\nTraumatic brain injury can have wide-ranging physical and psychological effects. Some signs or symptoms may appear immediately after the traumatic event, while others may appear days or weeks later.\n\nMild traumatic brain injury\nThe signs and symptoms of mild traumatic brain injury may include:\n\nPhysical symptoms\nHeadache\nNausea or vomiting\nFatigue or drowsiness\nProblems with speech\nDizziness or loss of balance\nSensory symptoms\nSensory problems, such as blurred vision, ringing in the ears, a bad taste in the mouth or changes in the ability to smell\nSensitivity to light or sound\nCognitive, behavioral or mental symptoms\nLoss of consciousness for a few seconds to a few minutes\nNo loss of consciousness, but a state of being dazed, confused or disoriented\nMemory or concentration problems\nMood changes or mood swings\nFeeling depressed or anxious\nDifficulty sleeping\nSleeping more than usual\nModerate to severe traumatic brain injuries\nModerate to severe traumatic brain injuries can include any of the signs and symptoms of mild injury, as well as these symptoms that may appear within the first hours to days after a head injury:\n\nPhysical symptoms\nLoss of consciousness from several minutes to hours\nPersistent headache or headache that worsens\nRepeated vomiting or nausea\nConvulsions or seizures\nDilation of one or both pupils of the eyes\nClear fluids draining from the nose or ears\nInability to awaken from sleep\nWeakness or numbness in fingers and toes\nLoss of coordination\nCognitive or mental symptoms\nProfound confusion\nAgitation, combativeness or other unusual behavior\nSlurred speech\nComa and other disorders of consciousness\nChildren's symptoms\nInfants and young children with brain injuries might not be able to communicate headaches, sensory problems, confusion and similar symptoms. In a child with traumatic brain injury, you may observe:\n\nChange in eating or nursing habits\nUnusual or easy irritability\nPersistent crying and inability to be consoled\nChange in ability to pay attention\nChange in sleep habits\nSeizures\nSad or depressed mood\nDrowsiness\nLoss of interest in favorite toys or activities\nWhen to see a doctor\nAlways see your doctor if you or your child has received a blow to the head or body that concerns you or causes behavioral changes. Seek emergency medical care if there are any signs or symptoms of traumatic brain injury following a recent blow or other traumatic injury to the head.\n\nThe terms \"mild,\" \"moderate\" and \"severe\" are used to describe the effect of the injury on brain function.

The degree of damage can depend on several factors, including the nature of the injury and the force of impact.\n\nCommon events causing traumatic brain injury include the following:\n\nFalls. Falls from bed or a ladder, down stairs, in the bath, and other falls are the most common cause of traumatic brain injury overall, particularly in older adults and young children.\nVehicle-related collisions. Collisions involving cars, motorcycles or bicycles \u2014 and pedestrians involved in such accidents \u2014 are a common cause of traumatic brain injury.\nViolence. Gunshot wounds, domestic violence, child abuse and other assaults are common causes. Shaken baby syndrome is a traumatic brain injury in infants caused by violent shaking.\nSports injuries. Traumatic brain injuries may be caused by injuries from a number of sports, including soccer, boxing, football, baseball, lacrosse, skateboarding, hockey, and other high-impact or extreme sports. These are particularly common in youth.\nExplosive blasts and other combat injuries. Explosive blasts are a common cause of traumatic brain injury in active-duty military personnel. Although how the damage occurs isn't yet well understood, many researchers believe that the pressure wave passing through the brain significantly disrupts brain function.\n\nTraumatic brain injury also results from penetrating wounds, severe blows to the head with shrapnel or debris, and falls or bodily collisions with objects following a blast.\n\nRisk factors\nThe people most at risk of traumatic brain injury include:\n\nChildren, especially newborns to 4-year-olds\nYoung adults, especially those between ages 15 and 24\nAdults age 60 and older\nMales in any age group\nComplications\nSeveral complications can occur immediately or soon after a traumatic brain injury. Severe injuries increase the risk of a greater number of and more-severe complications.\n\nAltered consciousness\nModerate to severe traumatic brain injury can result in prolonged or permanent changes in a person's state of consciousness, awareness or responsiveness. Different states of consciousness include:\n\nComa. A person in a coma is unconscious, unaware of anything and unable to respond to any stimulus. This results from widespread damage to all parts of the brain. After a few days to a few weeks, a person may emerge from a coma or enter a vegetative state.\nVegetative state. Widespread damage to the brain can result in a vegetative state. Although the person is unaware of surroundings, he or she may open his or her eyes, make sounds, respond to reflexes, or move.\n\nIt's possible that a vegetative state can become permanent, but often individuals progress to a minimally conscious state.\n\nMinimally conscious state. A minimally conscious state is a condition of severely altered consciousness but with some signs of self-awareness or awareness of one's environment. It is sometimes a transitional state from a coma or vegetative condition to greater recovery.\nBrain death. When there is no measurable activity in the brain and the brainstem, this is called brain death. In a person who has been declared brain dead, removal of breathing devices will result in cessation of breathing and eventual heart failure. Brain death is considered irreversible.\nPhysical complications\nSeizures. Some people with traumatic brain injury will develop seizures. The seizures may occur only in the early stages, or years after the injury. Recurrent seizures are called post-traumatic epilepsy.\nFluid buildup in the brain (hydrocephalus). Cerebrospinal fluid may build up in the spaces in the brain (cerebral ventricles) of some people who have had traumatic brain injuries, causing increased pressure and swelling in the brain.\nInfections. Skull fractures or penetrating wounds can tear the layers of protective tissues (meninges) that surround the brain. This can enable bacteria to enter the brain and cause infections. An infection of the meninges (meningitis) could spread to the rest of the nervous system if not treated.\nBlood vessel damage. Several small or large blood vessels in the brain may be damaged in a traumatic brain injury. This damage could lead to a stroke, blood clots or other problems.\nHeadaches. Frequent headaches are very common after a traumatic brain injury. They may begin within a week after the injury and could persist for as long as several months.\nVertigo. Many people experience vertigo, a condition characterized by dizziness, after a traumatic brain injury.\nSometimes, any or several of these symptoms might linger for a few weeks to a few months after a traumatic brain injury. When a combination of these symptoms lasts for an extended period of time, this is generally referred to as persistent post-concussive symptoms.\n\nTraumatic brain injuries at the base of the skull can cause nerve damage to the nerves that emerge directly from the brain (cranial nerves). Cranial nerve damage may result in:\n\nParalysis of facial muscles or losing sensation in the face\nLoss of or altered sense of smell or taste\nLoss of vision or double vision\nSwallowing problems\nDizziness\nRinging in the ear\nHearing loss\nIntellectual problems\nMany people who have had a significant brain injury will experience changes in their thinking (cognitive) skills. It may be more difficult to focus and take longer to process your thoughts. Traumatic brain injury can result in problems with many skills, including:\n\nCognitive problems\nMemory\nLearning\nReasoning\nJudgment\nAttention or concentration\nExecutive functioning problems\nProblem-solving\nMultitasking\nOrganization\nPlanning\nDecision-making\nBeginning or completing tasks\nCommunication problems\nLanguage and communications problems are common following traumatic brain injuries. These problems can cause frustration, conflict and misunderstanding for people with a traumatic brain injury, as well as family members, friends and care providers.\n\nCommunication problems may include:\n\nDifficulty understanding speech or writing\nDifficulty speaking or writing\nInability to organize thoughts and ideas\nTrouble following and participating in conversations\nCommunication problems that affect social skills may include:\n\nTrouble with turn taking or topic selection in conversations\nProblems with changes in tone, pitch or emphasis to express emotions, attitudes or subtle differences in meaning\nDifficulty understanding nonverbal signals\nTrouble reading cues from listeners\nTrouble starting or stopping conversations\nInability to use the muscles needed to form words (dysarthria)\nBehavioral changes\nPeople who've experienced brain injury may experience changes in behaviors. These may include:\n\nDifficulty with self-control\nLack of awareness of abilities\nRisky behavior\nDifficulty in social situations\nVerbal or physical outbursts\nEmotional changes\nEmotional changes may include:\n\nDepression\nAnxiety\nMood swings\nIrritability\nLack of empathy for others\nAnger\nInsomnia\nSensory problems\nProblems involving senses may include:\n\nPersistent ringing in the ears\nDifficulty recognizing objects\nImpaired hand-eye coordination\nBlind spots or double vision\nA bitter taste, a bad smell or difficulty smelling\nSkin tingling, pain or itching\nTrouble with balance or dizziness\nDegenerative brain diseases\nThe relationship between degenerative brain diseases and brain injuries is still unclear. But some research suggests that repeated or severe traumatic brain injuries might increase the risk of degenerative brain diseases. But this risk can't be predicted for an individual \u2014 and researchers are still investigating if, why and how traumatic brain injuries might be related to degenerative brain diseases.\n\nA degenerative brain disorder can cause gradual loss of brain functions, including:\n\nAlzheimer's disease, which primarily causes the progressive loss of memory and other thinking skills\nParkinson's disease, a progressive condition that causes movement problems, such as tremors, rigidity and slow movements\nDementia pugilistica \u2014 most often associated with repetitive blows to the head in career boxing \u2014 which causes symptoms of dementia and movement problems\nPrevention\nFollow these tips to reduce the risk of brain injury:\n\nSeat belts and airbags. Always wear a seat belt in a motor vehicle. A small child should always sit in the back seat of a car secured in a child safety seat or booster seat that is appropriate for his or her size and weight.\nAlcohol and drug use. Don't drive under the influence of alcohol or drugs, including prescription medications that can impair the ability to drive.\nHelmets. Wear a helmet while riding a bicycle, skateboard, motorcycle, snowmobile or all-terrain vehicle. Also wear appropriate head protection when playing baseball or contact sports, skiing, skating, snowboarding or riding a horse.\nPay attention to your surroundings. Don't drive, walk or cross the street while using your phone, tablet or any smart device. These distractions can lead to accidents or falls.\nPreventing falls\nThe following tips can help older adults avoid falls around the house:\n\nInstall handrails in bathrooms\nPut a nonslip mat in the bathtub or shower\nRemove area rugs\nInstall handrails on both sides of staircases\nImprove lighting in the home, especially around stairs\nKeep stairs and floors clear of clutter\nGet regular vision checkups\nGet regular exercise\nPreventing head injuries in children\nThe following tips can help children avoid head injuries:\n\nInstall safety gates at the top of a stairway\nKeep stairs clear of clutter\nInstall window guards to prevent falls\nPut a nonslip mat in the bathtub or shower\nUse playgrounds that have shock-absorbing materials on the ground\nMake sure area rugs are secure\nDon't let children play on fire escapes or balconies\nRequest an appointment\nBy Mayo Clinic Staff\nFeb 04, 2021\n\nPrint\n\nShow References\nDiagnosis & treatment\nDiseases & Conditions\nTraumatic brain injury symptoms & causes\nPatient Stories from Mayo Clinic\n\nUnforeseen danger of a child's fall: Livia's remarkable recovery\nAssociated Procedures\nBrain rehabilitation\nCT scan\nMRI\nProducts & Services\nA Book: Guide to the Comatose Patient\nCON-20378540\n\nMayo Clinic does not endorse companies or products.

Grocery store almonds, also known\nas sweet almonds, contain 25.2 milligrams of cyanide per kilogram of weight,\naccording to a 2013 study published in [ International Scholarly Research\nNotices Toxicology ](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/isrn/2013/610648/) .\n\nVideo of the Day\n\nFor perspective, a typical serving size of almonds is [ 1 ounce\n](https://tools.myfooddata.com/nutrition-\ncomparison.php?foods=12061&serv=wt5&qty=1) or 23 kernels, and 1 kilogram is\nequal to 35 ounces. The lethal dose of cyanide is [ 0.5 to 3.5 milligrams\n](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/isrn/2013/610648/) per kilogram of body\nweight. If you weigh 160 pounds, for the minimum lethal dose, you would need\nto eat 50 ounces of almonds or 1,150 kernels in one day to get the amount of\ncyanide from almonds necessary to be poisoned.

    "content": "The nasal cycle is the unconscious alternating partial congestion and decongestion of the nasal cavities in humans and other animals. This results in greater airflow through one nostril with periodic alternation between the nostrils. It is a physiological congestion of the nasal conchae, also called the nasal turbinates (curled bony projections within the nasal cavities), due to selective activation of one half of the autonomic nervous system by the hypothalamus. It should not be confused with pathological nasal congestion.\n\nDescription[edit]\nThe nasal cycle was studied and discussed in the ancient Indian yoga of literature of pranayama. In the modern western literature, it was first described by the German physician Richard Kayser  in 1895.\nIn 1927, Heetderks described the alternating turgescence of the inferior turbinates in 80% of a normal population. According to Heetderks, the cycle is the result of alternating congestion and decongestion of the nasal conchae or turbinates, predominantly the inferior turbinates, which are by far the largest of the turbinates in each nasal fossa.  Turbinates consist of bony projections covered by erectile tissue, much like the tissues of the penis and clitoris.  The turbinates in one fossa fill up with blood while the opposite turbinates decongest by shunting blood away. This cycle, which is controlled by the autonomic nervous system, has a mean duration of two and a half hours but varies widely with age, body-posture, and other conditions. He further observed and documented that the turbinates in the dependent nasal fossa fill when the patient is lying down. The nasal cycle is an alternation in both time and between left and right sides, with the total resistance in the nose remaining constant. The asymmetric airflow may have some benefit to overall olfactory sensitivity. In patients with a fixed septal deviation and intermittent nasal obstruction, the interplay of the nasal cycle becomes evident; the sensation of obstruction frequently mirrors the congestion phase.\nIt is possible that the nasal cycle may exacerbate the nasal congestion caused by the common cold, as the lack of motility of the cilia in one half of the nose may lead to an uncomfortable sensation of not being able to shift mucus by blowing the nose.\n\nBenefits for breathing[edit]\nIt has been shown that the cilia of the congested side suspend their motility until that side decongests. Thus the cycle ensures that one side of the nose is always moist, to facilitate humidification, which is one of the three functions of the nose, the other two being filtration and warming of inspired air prior to its entering the lungs.\n\nBenefits for olfaction[edit]\nSome odor chemicals bind with olfactory receptors easily, even under conditions of high airflow, and other odors need more time, under low airflow conditions, to bind with receptors. With high airflow on one side and low airflow on the other side, the olfactory center detects a greater range of smells.\n\nDistinction[edit]\nThe nasal cycle should not be confused with pathological nasal congestion: individuals with normal nasal breathing usually do not realize their breathing is asymmetric unless there is underlying nasal obstruction. In pathological conditions, however, the nasal cycle may influence the symptoms.\n\nResearch on the effects[edit]\nA 1994 study suggested that breathing through alternate nostrils can affect brain hemisphere symmetry on EEG topography. A later study in 2007 showed that this cycle (as well as manipulation through forced nostril breathing on one side) has an effect on endogenous ultradian rhythms of the autonomic and central nervous system.\nHowever, more recent research has shown no statistically significant association between spontaneously (i.e., not forced) dominant nostril and active brain hemisphere."

Eye diseases seen in dogs include\nconjunctivitis, dry eye, corneal ulcers, cataracts, glaucoma, and retinal\ndisorders. Early detection and treatment are essential for the best outcome.\nIf you notice any changes in your dog\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes, such as redness, swelling,\ndischarge, squinting, or tearing, it is important to see a veterinarian right\naway.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c  Puppy-dog eyes  opens in a new tab  \u00e2\u0080\u009d get dog parents every time.\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been  proven that gazing  opens in a new tab  into your pet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes\nproduces oxytocin and promotes bonding.

Common eye problems in dogs include:\u00c2\n\n  1. Eye infections \n\n  2. Dry eye\u00c2 \n\n  3. Cataracts \n\n  4. Glaucoma \n\n  5. Corneal ulcers \n\n  6. Uveitis \n\n  7. Conjunctivitis \n\n  8.

Retinal Disorders \n\n##  How dogs\u00e2\u0080\u0099 eyes work\n\nTo understand eye problems in dogs, it helps to know a little bit about how\ntheir eyes function. A dog\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes work much like a camera. Light first\nenters through the clear cornea then passes through the pupil. The iris\ncontrols the amount of light allowed in through the pupil. Next, light goes\nthrough the lens, which focuses the light on the retina \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a layer containing\ncolor-sensitive cones and motion- and light-sensitive rods, which convert\nlight into electrical signals. The cones and rods send these signals via the\noptic nerve to the brain, which constructs an image from them.\n\nDogs have only two types of cones, compared with the three types in human\neyes. As a result, dogs don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see  as many colors as people  opens in a new\ntab  do. Dog eyes also contain structures not found in a camera, such as the\ngel-like vitreous humor that fills the eyeball and gives it shape. Canine eyes\nare different from human eyes in that they have a third eyelid, called the\nnictitating membrane, which is a thin whitish-pink tissue that protects the\neye. And unlike humans, dogs have a reflective lining behind the retina called\nthe tapetum lucidum; it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what makes dogs\u00e2\u0080\u0099 eyes glow eerily when light\nhits them. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also what allows them to see in dimmer light.\n\nRelated article\n\nopens in a new tab\n\n###  Dog Vision: What Colors Do Dogs See?  opens in a new tab\n\nThey can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take in as many colors as you can, but their world isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just\nblack and white.\n\nThe visual streak is a horizontal band in the retina right above the optic\nnerve; this area has the highest concentration of rods and cones, and vision\nis sharpest here. The visual streak varies greatly among breeds, and studies\nsuggest that different breeds see the world differently. In dogs with long\nheads like wolves, the streak is wide, with the nerves evenly distributed. The\nshorter a breed\u00e2\u0080\u0099s head, the narrower (more circular) the streak tends to be.\nPugs, for example, have a small spot of sharp vision \u00e2\u0080\u0094 an \u00e2\u0080\u009carea\ncentralis\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 like humans do. Even within breeds, the visual streak can\nvary from type to type.\n\n##  How well do dogs see?\n\nAll of these features equip a dog to be a good hunter under various light\nconditions. The tapetum lucidum improves a dog\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vision in low light, as\ndoes the high proportion of rods to cones, giving dogs  better vision at night\nopens in a new tab  than humans. A rod-dense retina also makes dogs excellent\nat detecting motion and shapes. Because most dogs\u00e2\u0080\u0099 eyes angle slightly to\nthe side, they have a wider field of view than humans. When a wide field of\nvision combines with a wide visual streak, as in a German Shepherd, a dog can\nsee the whole horizon at once (instead of having to scan the eyes back and\nforth as humans do).\n\nWith keen senses of smell and hearing, dogs don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need to see well up close;\nin fact, near vision is blurry in long-nosed dogs. Short-nosed dogs, with\ntheir human-like area centralis, do appear to see well up close. Though the\narea centralis may lessen their ability as hunters, it may make them better\nlap dogs, more able to \u00e2\u0080\u009cread\u00e2\u0080\u009d their parents\u00e2\u0080\u0099 faces. Overall, dog vision\nis less sharp than human vision.\n\n##  What are the signs of eye problems in dogs?\n\nDog parents may be cued into an issue with their dog\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eye if it changes in\nappearance or if their dog seems to be experiencing eye irritation. Any\nconcerns about a dog\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes should not be ignored. Signs of eye problems in\ndogs include:\n\n  * Squinting \n\n  * Eye discharge (especially if it is not clear) \n\n  * Eye redness \n\n  * Cloudiness \n\n  * Pawing at the eye\u00c2 \n\n  * Sudden change in vision (bumping into things, anxiety, hesitation to walk) \n\n  * Swollen eyes \n\n  * Bulging eyes \n\n  * Persistently dilated or constricted pupils \n\nRelated article\n\nopens in a new tab\n\n###  Everything You Need to Know About Cataracts in Dogs  opens in a new tab\n\nHere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s how to spot the eye condition and help your dog see more clearly.\n\n##  What are the dog breeds prone to eye problems?\n\nWhile eye issues can affect any dog, certain breeds face a greater risk.\nBrachycephalic (smoosh faced) dogs breeds are prone to eye problems.\nBrachycephalic breeds  opens in a new tab  include Pugs, French Bulldogs,\nEnglish Bulldogs, Boston Terriers, Lhasa Apsos, and Bullmastiffs. The skull\nshapes in these dogs not only contribute to a higher risk for respiratory\nproblems, but they have a higher incidence of eye issues as well. Their eyes\nbulge out more, contributing to a host of issues often lumped together as\nbrachycephalic ocular syndrome.\u00c2\n\nDogs with brachycephalic ocular syndrome tend to have shallow eye sockets,\ncontributing to eyes that are more likely to pop out as a result of trauma\n(proptosis). They are also more likely to have dry eyes and corneal ulcers,\neither from low tear production or from an inability to close their eyes all\nthe way. Eyelid issues like entropion and trichiasis cause facial hairs to\nconstantly scrape the eye\u00e2\u0080\u0099s surface, causing discomfort and trauma to the\ncornea.\u00c2\n\n###  Common dog eye problems\n\nDog eyes are susceptible to a variety of issues. Some can be easily addressed\nby your veterinarian while others may call for a referral to a veterinary\nophthalmologist. Here are some of the most common eye problems in dogs:\n\n###  Eye infections\n\nViral and bacterial eye infections are commonly diagnosed in dogs. Fungal eye\ninfections occur in dogs but are less common. Eye infections can affect the\nconjunctiva (the pink tissue around the eye) or the eye itself. Symptoms of\neye infections include yellow or green eye discharge, crusting around the\neyes, redness, and discomfort. Treatment often involves administering\nmedicated eye drops. Depending on the severity and type of infection, oral\nmedications may be prescribed, too.\u00c2\n\nRelated article\n\nopens in a new tab\n\n###  What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s This Weird Red Bump On My Dog\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Eye?  opens in a new tab\n\nThat would be a cherry eye, and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll want to see your vet.\n\n###  Dry eye\n\nDry eye occurs when not enough tears are produced to keep the eyes properly\nlubricated. Dogs may inherit this condition; among the dog breeds at higher\nrisk are the American Cocker Spaniel, English Bulldog, Pug, Lhasa Apso,\nPekinese, Shih Tzu, and West Highland White Terrier. Small, flat-faced dogs\nsometimes have eyes that bulge so much that their eyelids cannot close, which\nmakes the surface of the eyes to dry out.\n\nDry eye  opens in a new tab  may also result from an immune system reaction,\nan injury, or a drug side effect. Dryness can be a serious problem for dogs\nbecause dry eyes are easily irritated and may develop conjunctivitis or\ncorneal ulcers. Artificial tears, good eye hygiene, anti-inflammatory drugs,\nand/or cyclosporine ointment (Optimmune) may help.\n\n###  Cataracts\n\nThe most common cause of blindness in dogs, a cataract is a clouding of the\nlens that obscures the dog\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vision. Most  dogs with cataracts  opens in a\nnew tab  inherited the tendency to develop them. Inherited cataracts can occur\nin the Afghan Hound, American Cocker Spaniel, Boston Terrier, Chesapeake Bay\nRetriever, German Shepherd, Golden Retriever, Labrador Retriever, Miniature\nSchnauzer, Norwegian Buhund, Old English Sheepdog, Schnauzer, Siberian Husky,\nStaffordshire Bull Terrier, Standard Poodle, Welsh Springer Spaniel, and West\nHighland White Terrier.  Diabetes  opens in a new tab  , injuries, poor  diet\nopens in a new tab  , and aging can also lead to cataracts.\n\nSurgery is available to treat dogs with cataracts. Removing the lens allows\nlight to enter the eye again. For best post-surgery vision, the natural lens\nis usually replaced by a plastic lens. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe surgery itself is not too\nstressful for the majority of patients,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Dr. Lim. However, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe first\nfew weeks postoperatively can be stressful because it is very intensive \u00e2\u0080\u0094\nthe patient must wear an Elizabethan collar at all times, and several\nmedications are required.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n###  Glaucoma\n\nGlaucoma is the elevated pressure created by the fluid inside the eyeball\ndraining more slowly than it is produced. Dogs with glaucoma can experience\ndamage to the retina or optic nerve.\n\nMost often, dogs get glaucoma because they inherited an eye structure that\nleads to poor drainage. Dog breeds in which primary (inherited) glaucoma\noccurs include the Alaskan Malamute, American Cocker Spaniel, Basset Hound,\nBeagle, Boston Terrier, Bouvier des Flandres, Chow Chow, Dalmatian, English\nCocker Spaniel, English Springer Spaniel, Great Dane, Labrador Retriever,\nNorwegian Elkhound, Poodle (all sizes), Samoyed, Shar-Pei, Shih Tzu, Siberian\nHusky, and Welsh Springer Spaniel.\n\nPrimary glaucoma has no obvious cause, and it affects both eyes (although one\neye may develop glaucoma earlier than the other). Secondary glaucoma is\nglaucoma that is caused by a dislocated lens, injury, tumor, or other problem\nthat decreases fluid drainage in the eye; it may affect just one eye.\n\nGlaucoma treatments include surgery, pills, eye drops, or (rarely) removal of\nthe eyeball. \u00e2\u0080\u009cGlaucoma is still one of the more difficult things to\nhandle,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Dr. Vainisi. \u00e2\u0080\u009cEven though there are literally dozens of\nglaucoma procedures, there still is not that ideal one\u00e2\u0080\u00a6even in humans.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRelated article\n\nopens in a new tab\n\n###  How to Find a Veterinary Specialist  opens in a new tab\n\nJust like your doctor would refer to you a specialist for expert care for a\ncomplicated issue, your vet may do the same for your dog.\n\n###  Corneal ulcers\n\nCorneal ulcers are slow-healing sores on the dog\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cornea, accompanied by\ninflammation. Most ulcers are caused by injuries, and treatment often involves\nantibiotics. Small dog breeds with very short noses and big eyeballs are more\nprone to eye injuries, says Dr. Samuel J. Vainisi, DVM, ACVO of the Animal Eye\nClinic in Denmark, Wisc. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBecause of that, we see a lot of ulcers on the\neyes of breeds such as the Boston Terrier, the Pekinese, and the Shih Tzu.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n###  Uveitis\n\nUveitis  opens in a new tab  refers to inflammation inside of the eye. This\ninflammation typically stems from the eye\u00e2\u0080\u0099s blood vessels. Uveitis usually\ndevelops secondary to another cause including trauma, infection, tick-borne\ndisease, auto-immune disease, or metabolic disease. Uveitis can cause pain in\ndogs, and the symptoms often reflect this discomfort. Symptoms of uveitis in\ndogs include squinting, rubbing the eyes, and ocular discharge. The eyes can\nappear red or cloudy. Treating uveitis involves addressing the inflammation\nand treating the underlying cause.\u00c2\n\n###  Conjunctivitis\n\nConjunctivitis is a condition in which the lining of the eyelids and the\nsclera (the white of the eye) become inflamed. It can be caused by infection,\nan object in the dog\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eye, an allergic reaction, dry eye, a scratch, or\neven smoke or dust. It can also be a symptom of other diseases. Treatment\ndepends on the cause, but often entails addressing inflammation and infection.\n\n###  Watery eyes\n\nWatery eyes, or epiphora, is commonly seen in dogs. Dogs develop epiphora for\ntwo reasons \u00e2\u0080\u0094 either excess tear production from eye irritation or more\ntears present due to a lack of drainage. Eyes can become irritated from\nallergies  opens in a new tab  , trauma, or infection. Normally, tears from\nthe eyes drain through the nasolacrimal duct into the nasal cavity. When\ndrainage is obstructed or poor, tears run down a dog's face instead. Tears can\nstain the fur on the face, which is a cosmetic concern for some dog parents.\nClear tears and clear eyes are typically not considered to be a medical issue.\nExcessive tears with signs of eye irritation should be evaluated by a\nveterinarian.\u00c2\n\nRelated article\n\nopens in a new tab\n\n###  Dog Vision: What Colors Do Dogs See?  opens in a new tab\n\nThey can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take in as many colors as you can, but their world isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just\nblack and white.\n\n####  Entropion/ectropion\n\nEntropion occurs when one or both eyelids are inverted inwards. Entropion in\ndogs can occur due to genetics, developmental abnormalities, or secondary to\neyelid trauma. Entropion is most commonly diagnosed in young, large breed\ndogs. Breeds that are predisposed to entropion include Bull Mastiffs, Chow\nChows, Labrador Retrievers, Standard Poodles, Chesapeake Bay Retrievers, and\nShar Peis. Entropion can cause the eyelashes to rub on the cornea, causing\npain and trauma. Treatment often involves surgical correction.\u00c2\n\nEctropion occurs when an eyelid is turned outward or when the lower eyelid\nsags, creating minimal contact with the eye. Ectropion in dogs is typically\ncongenital. Breeds predisposed to ectropion include Saint Bernards,\nBloodhounds, Great Danes, and Spaniels. Picture droopy eyed dogs. When they\nblink, their lower eyelids do not make adequate contact with their eyes and\ncannot help with lubricating the cornea or wiping away irritants. Over time,\nthe eyes can become dry and inflamed. Treatment can range from temporary anti-\ninflammatory medications to chronic eye lubricant application to corrective\nsurgery.\u00c2\n\n###  Bulging eyes\u00c2\n\nDog\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes can bulge as a result of trauma or underlying medical conditions\nlike glaucoma. A bulgy eye appearance can be from proptosis (displacement of\nthe eye) or buphthalmos (enlargement of the eye). A dog\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes should be the\nsame size and rest comfortably in their eye sockets. Any change to this state\nis considered a medical emergency.\n\n###  Cherry eye\n\nDogs have a nictitating membrane, commonly called the third eyelid, that aids\nin tear production and eye protection. When this gland becomes displaced and\nprotrudes, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s called a  cherry eye  opens in a new tab  and looks like\nsmooth, pink tissue protruding from the inside corner of the eye. This limits\nthe tear production in the eye and can cause dryness and irritation. The\nexposed tissue also becomes inflamed. While mild cases may be treated\nmedically, surgical replacement is often recommended to address cherry eye.\nAny dog can develop a cherry eye, but brachycephalic breeds like English\nBulldogs and Shih Tzus have a higher risk.\u00c2\n\n###  Lazy eye\n\nStrabismus refers to having eyes that don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t face the same direction. This is\nusually due to incoordination of the eye muscles. Strabismus in dogs is often\ngenetic and does not cause any health issues; most dogs born with a lazy eye\ndo not require any treatment. A dog that suddenly develops a lazy eye should\nbe evaluated. A sudden change in eye position can develop as a result of\ntumors in or near the eye, neurological problems, or trauma. Treatment for\nacute strabismus in dogs depends on the cause.\u00c2\n\n###  Retinal disorders\n\nProgressive retinal atrophy (PRA) is the name for a group of retinal disorders\nin which rods and cones die off. There is no treatment for this condition.\nDogs who get PRA do so because they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve inherited a defective gene. Although\nPRA strikes more than 100 breeds of dogs, different genes can be responsible\nfor it. Therefore, breeds differ in the age at which the condition appears,\nhow fast the condition progresses, and the ratio of males to females among\naffected dogs.\u00c2\n\nRelated article\n\nopens in a new tab\n\n###  Everything You Need to Know About Cataracts in Dogs  opens in a new tab\n\nHere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s how to spot the eye condition and help your dog see more clearly.\n\nPRA appears during puppyhood in the Cardigan Welsh Corgi, Cairn Terrier,\nCollie, Gordon Setter, Great Dane, Irish Setter, Miniature Schnauzer and\nNorwegian Elkhound. In contrast, some breeds usually don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t develop PRA until\nadulthood. These include the American Cocker Spaniel, English Cocker Spaniel,\nLabrador Retriever, Lhasa Apso, Miniature Poodle, Portuguese Water Dog,\nTibetan Spaniel, and Tibetan Terrier. PRA occurs mostly in males in the\nSiberian Husky and Samoyed. Genetic tests for PRA are available for several\nbreeds.\n\nOther retinal problems include detachment of the retina from the back of the\neye, inflammation, and abnormal development. Causes include infection and\ninjury. Some retinal disorders have no treatment, while others can be helped\nby surgery or treatment of the cause.\n\nSmall dogs may be more prone to retinal detachment. According to Dr. Vainisi,\nseveral small breeds of dogs, including Boston Terriers, Jack Russell\nTerriers, and Shih Tzus, love to pick up toys and shake them hard. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFluid\ngoes violently back and forth in the back of the eye, and it just rips the\nretina right off,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he says. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOne moment they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing, and the next\nmoment they can be totally blind.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n###  How to treat your dog\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eye problem\n\nThe best way to protect your dog\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vision is to  catch eye disorders early\nopens in a new tab  , when they are most easily treated. A dog with eye or\nvision problems may paw at or scratch their eye, squint, bump into things,\nbecome afraid of the dark, or be frightened in situations that did not\nfrighten them before. The dog\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eye may produce discharge, be red, look\ncloudy or be swollen. The nictitating membrane may partially cover the eye.\n\nIf your dog seems to have an eye problem, take them to the veterinarian right\naway. Your vet may have the knowledge and equipment to diagnose and treat the\nproblem immediately; if not, they may refer your dog to a veterinary\nophthalmologist, a specialist in animal eyes and their disorders.\n\nRelated article\n\nopens in a new tab\n\n###  What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s This Weird Red Bump On My Dog\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Eye?  opens in a new tab\n\nThat would be a cherry eye, and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll want to see your vet.\n\nOnly about 300 veterinarians in the United States have board certification\nfrom the American College of Veterinary Ophthalmologists. As a result, if your\ndog needs a veterinary ophthalmologist, you may need to travel to see one.\nSome, but not all, veterinary ophthalmologists see dogs only by referral.\n\nThe bottom line: If your dog has an eye issue, make an appointment with your\nvet right away. That way, your dog won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need to suffer or develop a worse\nissue unnecessarily.\n\n##  Can you prevent dog eye problems?\u00c2\n\nThe best thing dog parents can do to protect their dog\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes is to minimize\nrisk of injury and prioritize overall health. Keep your dog away from other\nanimals that may not want to play nice. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t let them hang around smoke or\nany aerosols that can irritate their eyes.\u00c2\n\nKeep your pup up to date on vaccinations and preventatives to avoid infections\nand tick-borne disease. Feed an appropriate diet and provide lots of exercise\nto help prevent metabolic diseases like diabetes. Proactive petcare overlaps\nwith dog eye disease prevention.\n\n##  FAQs (People also ask):\n\n###  Can I use over-the-counter eye drops for my dog's eye problems?\n\nNever apply any human medications to your dog\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes without consulting a\nveterinarian first. Human medications are not formulated for dogs and may\ninclude ingredients that can worsen your dog\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eye condition.\u00c2\n\n###  Is there any home remedy available for eye problems in dogs?\n\nIf your dog has excessive eye discharge or crusty eye boogers, you can gently\nwipe it away with a cotton ball or washcloth soaked in warm water. Be sure to\nseek veterinary care to address the underlying cause of the discharge.\u00c2\n\n###  When should I seek immediate veterinary care for my dog's eye issue?\n\nAny eye issue should be addressed as soon as possible before it progresses to\nsomething that can affect a dog\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vision. If your dog\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes change in\nappearance or your dog vision seems suddenly impaired, seek veterinary\nattention ASAP.\u00c2\n\n##  References:\n\n  * Oxytocin-Gaze Positive Loop and the Coevolution of Human-Dog Bonds  opens in a new tab \n\n  * Curiosities: How Well Do Dogs See at Night?  opens in a new tab \n\n  * A Common Problems Of Dog Eyes (A Review)  opens in a new tab \n\n  * Clinical Signs of Brachycephalic Ocular Syndrome in 93 Dogs  opens in a new tab \n\n  * Prevalence of the Breed-Related Glaucomas in Pure-Bred Dogs in North America  opens in a new tab \n\n  * Cote's Clinical veterinary Advisor: Dogs and Cats - E-Book  opens in a new tab \n\n  * Nasolacrimal and Lacrimal Apparatus in Animals  opens in a new tab \n\nTags\n\n  * dog  opens in a new tab \n  * dog health  opens in a new tab \n  * senior dog  opens in a new tab \n\n##  Shauna S.

    "content": "Cope's rule, named after American paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope, postulates that population lineages tend to increase in body size over evolutionary time. It was never actually stated by Cope, although he favoured the occurrence of linear evolutionary trends. It is sometimes also known as the Cope\u2013Dep\u00e9ret rule, because Charles Dep\u00e9ret explicitly advocated the idea. Theodor Eimer had also done so earlier. The term \"Cope's rule\" was apparently coined by Bernhard Rensch, based on the fact that Dep\u00e9ret had \"lionized Cope\" in his book. While the rule has been demonstrated in many instances, it does not hold true at all taxonomic levels, or in all clades. Larger body size is associated with increased fitness for a number of reasons, although there are also some disadvantages both on an individual and on a clade level: clades comprising larger individuals are more prone to extinction, which may act to limit the maximum size of organisms.\n\nFunction[edit]\nEffects of growth[edit]\nDirectional selection appears to act on organisms' size, whereas it exhibits a far smaller effect on other morphological traits, though it is possible that this perception may be a result of sample bias. This selectional pressure can be explained by a number of advantages, both in terms of mating success and survival rate.\nFor example, larger organisms find it easier to avoid or fight off predators and capture prey, to reproduce, to kill competitors, to survive temporary lean times, and to resist rapid climatic changes. They may also potentially benefit from better thermal efficiency, increased intelligence, and a longer lifespan.\nOffsetting these advantages, larger organisms require more food and water, and shift from r to K-selection. Their longer generation time means a longer period of reliance on the mother, and on a macroevolutionary scale restricts the clade's ability to evolve rapidly in response to changing environments.\nCapping growth[edit]\nLeft unfettered, the trend of ever-larger size would produce organisms of gargantuan proportions. Therefore, some factors must limit this process.\nAt one level, it is possible that the clade's increased vulnerability to extinction, as its members become larger, means that no taxon survives long enough for individuals to reach huge sizes. There are probably also physically imposed limits to the size of some organisms; for instance, insects must be small enough for oxygen to diffuse to all parts of their bodies, flying birds must be light enough to fly, and the length of giraffes' necks may be limited by the blood pressure it is possible for their hearts to generate. Finally, there may be a competitive element, in that changes in size are necessarily accompanied by changes in ecological niche. For example, terrestrial carnivores over 21\u00a0kg almost always prey on organisms larger, not smaller, than themselves. If such a niche is already occupied, competitive pressure may oppose the directional selection. The three Canidae clades (Hesperocyoninae, Borophaginae, and Caninae) all show a trend towards larger size, although the first two are now extinct.\n\nValidity[edit]\nCope recognised that clades of Cenozoic mammals appeared to originate as small individuals, and that body mass increased through a clade's history. Discussing the case of canid evolution in North America, Blaire Van Valkenburgh of UCLA and coworkers state:\nCope's rule, or the evolutionary trend toward larger body size, is common among mammals. Large size enhances the ability to avoid predators and capture prey, enhances reproductive success, and improves thermal efficiency. Moreover, in large carnivores, interspecific competition for food tends to be relatively intense, and bigger species tend to dominate and kill smaller competitors. Progenitors of hypercarnivorous lineages may have started as relatively small-bodied scavengers of large carcasses, similar to foxes and coyotes, with selection favoring both larger size and enhanced craniodental adaptations for meat eating. Moreover, the evolution of predator size is likely to be influenced by changes in prey size, and a significant trend toward larger size has been documented for large North American mammals, including both herbivores and carnivores, in the Cenozoic.\nIn some cases, the increase in body size may represent a passive, rather than an active, trend. In other words, the maximum size increases, but the minimum size does not; this is usually a result of size varying pseudo-randomly rather than directed evolution. This does not fall into Cope's rule sensu stricto, but is considered by many workers to be an example of \"Cope's rule sensu lato\". In other cases, an increase in size may in fact represent a transition to an optimal body size, and not imply that populations always develop to a larger size.\nHowever, many palaeobiologists are skeptical of the validity of Cope's rule, which may merely represent a statistical artefact. Purported examples of Cope's rule often assume that the stratigraphic age of fossils is proportional to their \"clade rank\", a measure of how derived they are from an ancestral state; this relationship is in fact quite weak. Counterexamples to Cope's rule are common throughout geological time; although size increase does occur more often than not, it is by no means universal. For example, among genera of Cretaceous molluscs, an increase in size is no more common than stasis or a decrease. In many cases, Cope's rule only operates at certain taxonomic levels (for example, an order may obey Cope's rule, while its constituent families do not), or more generally, it may apply to only some clades of a taxon.  Giant dinosaurs appear to have evolved dozens of times, in response to local environmental conditions.\nDespite many counter-examples, Cope's rule is supported in many instances. For example, all marine invertebrate phyla except the molluscs show a size increase between the Cambrian and Permian. Collectively, dinosaurs exhibit an increase in body length over their evolution. Cope's rule also appears to hold in clades where a constraint on size is expected. For instance, one may expect the size of birds to be constrained, as larger masses mean more energy must be expended in flight. Birds have been suggested to follow Cope's law, although a subsequent reanalysis of the same data suggested otherwise.\nAn extensive study published in 2015 supports the presence of a trend toward larger body size in marine animals during the Phanerozoic. However, this trend was present mainly in the Paleozoic and Cenozoic; the Mesozoic was a period of relative stasis. The trend is not attributable simply to neutral drift in body size from small ancestors, and was mainly driven by a greater rate of diversification in classes of larger mean size. A smaller component of the overall trend is due to trends of increasing size within individual families.\n\nNotes[edit]\n^  In his paper, Rensch reproduced an erroneous citation of a work of Cope's (that he apparently had not read) from the English translation of Dep\u00e9ret's book."

But as you prepare to enjoy yourself, don\u2019t forget\nto consider the impact these events could have on your hearing health.\n\nSigns of auditory damage after loud events may include ear ringing or muffled\nhearing. These can be temporary but have a cumulative effect over time. If you\nthink your hearing has been impacted, consult with an audiologist for further\nevaluation.\n\nHere are six practical tips to keep your ears safe during loud events.\n\n  1. Safeguard Your Hearing Through Awareness \n\nWhen it comes to hearing loss, prevention is the best approach. Prolonged\nexposure to music at unsafe levels can lead to noise-induced hearing loss and\nother auditory issues.\n\nConcerts, games, and festivals often involve loud music and amplified sound\nsystems, which can exceed safe listening levels (sounds at or below 70\ndecibels). Build a habit of thinking about your hearing health before you head\nto an event.\n\n  2. Earplugs Are Your Ultimate Companion \n\nInvest in a pair of high-quality earplugs, especially if you\u2019re a regular\nconcert-goer or live-sports fan.\n\nEarplugs specially designed for music events offer a balanced sound experience\nwhile reducing the overall sound level. Look for earplugs with a noise\nreduction rating (NRR) of 15+ decibels to ensure adequate protection without\ncompromising the musical quality. It should be listed clearly on the package.\n\nWhether you\u2019re using foam earplugs, reusable earplugs, or custom hearing\nprotection fit by a qualified professional, remember this: The best hearing\nprotection is hearing protection that is actually used!\n\n  3. Position Yourself Strategically \n\nChoosing the right spot at the venue can significantly impact your exposure to\nloud sounds.\n\nAvoid standing directly in front of the speakers or amplifiers, as this is\nwhere the sound intensity is the highest.\n\nInstead, position yourself further back or to the side, where the sound is\nmore evenly distributed. This adjustment will help lower the risk of exposing\nyour ears to damaging loudness levels.\n\n  4. Limit Listening Time \n\nWhen attending multi-day festivals like the Rochester International Jazz\nFestival, Fairport Music Fest, and Party in the Park in Rochester this summer,\nbe mindful of the cumulative exposure to loud music. Prolonged exposure to\nhigh sound levels increases the risk of hearing damage.\n\nConsider spreading your concert experiences across multiple days, allowing\nyour ears ample time to rest and recover.\n\nAlternatively, if attending a single-day event, plan your schedule to include\nbreaks and quieter moments between performances. This respite allows your ears\nto heal and reduces the cumulative impact of loud sounds.\n\n  5. Familiarize Yourself with Volume Settings \n\nWhether you're heading to an indoor arena or an open-air music festival,\nfamiliarize yourself with the volume settings of the event.\n\nMany venues now display sound levels at various stages or offer mobile apps\nthat provide real-time decibel readings. Monitoring these levels can help you\nmake informed decisions about when to use earplugs or take breaks.\n\nLearn more about loudness safety levels at the  National Institute for\nOccupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) website.\n\n  6. Take Extra Care Around Fireworks \n\nWearing earplugs around fireworks can be helpful in reducing injury to your\nears. However, they can also inhibit your awareness of what's happening around\nyou.\n\nKeep your head on a swivel when wearing earplugs, or you could miss an\nimportant \u201cWatch out!\u201d\n\nIf people are setting off fireworks within close quarters, ask to be told\nbefore a firework is sent off to ensure you\u2019re seeing them from a safe\ndistance.\n\nMusic and sports enthusiasts must balance enjoying the energy and excitement\nof concerts and events while keeping our hearing health in mind. By\ncultivating awareness, investing in quality earplugs, adopting strategic\npositioning, taking breaks, and advocating for responsible sound management,\nwe can ensure that our love for music, sports, and more remains.\n\n##  Tags\n\n  * parents \n  * children \n  * ear \n  * nose &amp; throat \n\n##  Author\n\nElizabeth Beach\n\n##  Browse Stories\n\n  * Healthy Living \n  * Patient Care \n  * Research \n  * Education \n  * Community \n  * People \n\n##  Related Stories\n\n###  Wilmot's Dialogue Magazine: Celebrating 50 Years of \u201cUnimaginable\u201d\nProgress and a Bold Future\n\n###  Strong Memorial Hospital Earns Fifth Magnet Accreditation for Nursing\nExcellence\n\n###  Cancer is a Disease of Aging, but Studies of Older Adults Sorely Lacking\n\nWant URMC news articles delivered right to your inbox?\n\nSign up today \u00bb\n\nLooking for events in and near the Medical Center?\n\nCheck out the calendar \u00bb\n\n  * URMC Information \n  * About URMC \n  * Our Hospitals \n  * Departments & Centers \n  * Directions & Parking \n  * Newsroom \n  * Job Opportunities \n  * Contact Information \n\n  * Tools \n  * Event Calendar \n  * Find a Physician \n  * Health Encyclopedia \n  * Faculty Lists \n  * MyChart Patient Portal \n  * Online Bill Pay \n\n  * General Information \n  * UR Medicine \n  * University of Rochester \n  * Web Accessibility \n  * Faculty & Staff Directory \n  * Emergency Information \n\n\u00a9 2024 University of Rochester Medical Center Rochester,  NY\n\n  * Intranet \n  * Email \n  * HRMS \n  * Remote Access  (VPN) \n  * Privacy Topics \n\n  * Newsroom \n  * Publications \n\nDialogue  NeURoscience  Nursing  Rochester Medicine  Strong Kids  View All\nPublications\n\n  * Media Inquiries \n\nImages and Video  Additional Resources\n\n  * Archives \n  * About Us \n  * Explore URMC \n\n  *[\n        NY\n       ]: New York\n  *[\n           HRMS\n          ]: Human Resources Management System\n  *[\n           (VPN)\n          ]: Virtual Private Network\n\n"

It is a\nsphincter muscle arranged in concentric bands around the upper and lower\neyelids. The main function of the orbicularis oculi muscle is to close the\neyelids. This occurs when the muscle contracts. It also assists in the\ndrainage of tears from the eyes. Whenever the orbicularis oculi muscle\ncontracts, the tears are drawn from the tear film via the lacrimal pump\nsystem.  [1]  [2]  [3]\n\n##  Structure and Function\n\nThe orbicularis oculi muscle closes the eyelids and assists in pumping the\ntears from the eye into the nasolacrimal duct system. The orbital section of\nthe orbicularis oculi is more involved in the voluntary closure of the eyelid,\nsuch as with winking and forced squeezing. The preseptal section is involved\nin both the voluntary forced closure as well as the involuntary blink closure\nof the eye and keeping the eyelids closed during sleep. The pretarsal section\nis more involved in the involuntary blink closure of the eye and keeping the\neyelids closed during sleep.\n\nWhen the palpebral orbicularis muscle contracts, it shortens the canaliculi of\nthe nasolacrimal duct system, squeezing the tears into the lacrimal sac. Also,\nthe muscle also pulls the lacrimal sac laterally and forward, creating a\nvacuum to draw the tears into the sac.\n\n##  Embryology\n\nOrbicularis oculi muscle forms from mesoderm in the eyelids in the twelfth\nweek. It is derived from the mesenchyme of the second pharyngeal arch.\n\n##  Blood Supply and Lymphatics\n\nThe orbicularis oculi muscle receives its blood from the branches of the\nfacial artery and superficial temporal artery (which are branches of the\nexternal carotid artery), as well as the ophthalmic artery (which is a branch\nof the internal carotid artery).\n\nThe common carotid arteries arise from the brachiocephalic trunk on the right\nside and directly from the aortic arch on the left side. At the superior\nborder of the thyroid cartilage in the neck, each common carotid artery\ndivides into the internal and external carotid arteries.\n\nThe external carotid artery continues superiorly and splits into a number of\nbranches, including the facial artery, superior temporal artery, superior\nthyroid artery, lingual artery, facial artery, ascending pharyngeal artery,\noccipital artery, maxillary artery, and posterior auricular artery. The facial\nartery then courses from the mandibular area, up the side of the nose and to\nthe medial canthus of the eye, where it is called the angular artery. Branches\nof the facial artery and superficial temporal artery supply the orbicularis\noculi muscle.\n\nThe internal carotid artery enters the skull through the carotid canal in the\ntemporal bone. It travels through the cavernous sinus and then splits off a\nmajor branch call the ophthalmic artery. The ophthalmic artery enters the\norbit through the optic canal. Within the orbit, it divides into various\nbranches, including the lacrimal artery, supraorbital artery, ethmoidal\narteries, supratrochlear artery, central retinal artery, ciliary arteries, and\nmuscular branches. Some of these branches, such as the lacrimal artery and\nsupraorbital artery, supply the orbicularis oculi muscle.\n\n##  Nerves\n\nThe orbicularis oculi are innervated by the seventh cranial nerve, the facial\nnerve. The upper half of the orbicularis oculi muscle receives its innervation\nfrom the temporal branch of the seventh cranial nerve (facial nerve), while\nthe lower half receives its innervation from the zygomatic branch of the\nseventh cranial nerve (facial nerve).\n\nIntracranially, the seventh cranial nerve starts in the pons of the brainstem.\nIt goes through the internal acoustic meatus and then the facial canal of the\ntemporal bone. The seventh nerve then exits the skull through the stylomastoid\nforamen, which is posterior to the styloid process of the temporal bone. It\nthen passes through the parotid gland where it splits into five branches,\nwhich innervate the muscles of facial expression. These branches are the\ntemporal branch, zygomatic branch, buccal branch, marginal mandibular branch,\nand cervical branch.\n\nThe temporal branch courses superiorly and medially to innervate the upper\nhalf of the orbicularis oculi muscle as well as the frontalis muscle and\ncorrugator supercilii muscle. The zygomatic branch courses medially and\ninnervates the lower half of the orbicularis oculi muscle.\n\n##  Muscles\n\nThe orbicularis muscle is located just underneath the skin of the eyelid. In\ngeneral, the muscle attaches to the medial canthal region medially and the\nlateral canthal region laterally. The orbicularis oculi muscle is divided into\ntwo sections, the orbital and palpebral sections. The palpebral section is\nfurther subdivided into the preseptal and pretarsal sections. These sections\nhave a complex arrangement of attachments to the surrounding structures.\n\nThe orbital section of the orbicularis oculi muscle attaches medially to the\nanterior limb of the medial canthal tendon and the surrounding periosteum.\nLaterally, the orbital section attaches to the lateral palpebral raphe. At the\nmuscle\u2019s peripheral borders, it interdigitates into the surrounding muscles,\nsuch as the frontalis muscle superiorly.\n\nThe preseptal orbicularis oculi muscle divides medially into a deep head and a\nsuperficial head. The deep head of the muscle attaches to the fascia around\nthe lacrimal sac as well as the posterior lacrimal crest, while the\nsuperficial head of the muscle attaches to the anterior limb of the medial\ncanthal ligament. Laterally, the preseptal orbicularis oculi muscle attaches\nto Whitnall\u2019s lateral orbital tubercle, which is deep to the lateral palpebral\nraphe.\n\nThe pretarsal orbicularis oculi muscle also divides medially into a deep head\nand a superficial head. The deep head of the muscle attaches behind the\nposterior lacrimal crest and to the medial canthal tendon, while the\nsuperficial head of the muscle attaches to the anterior lacrimal crest. The\ndeep or posterior head of the pretarsal orbicularis oculi muscle is also known\nas Horner\u2019s muscle. Laterally, the muscle attaches to the lateral canthal\ntendon. The superior and inferior pretarsal orbicularis oculi muscles are\noverlain the respective upper and lower eyelid tarsi. The muscle is firmly\nadherent the underlying tarsus.\n\nThe marginal portion of the palpebral orbicularis muscle adjacent to the\neyelid margin is known as the muscle of Riolan or pars ciliaris. This\nsuperficial portion of the muscle can be seen along the length of the upper\nand lower eyelid margins as a colored line and is a surface anatomic landmark\nknown as the gray line. The gray line is a clinical landmark often used in the\nsurgical repair of lacerations of the eyelid margin to help surgeons realign\nthe margins precisely.\n\n##  Clinical Significance\n\nIf the orbicularis oculi muscle does not function for any reason, such as with\nBell\u2019s palsy or paralysis of the seventh cranial nerve, then the eyelids\ncannot close well. This condition requires aggressive lubrication of the eye\nwith artificial tear drops and ointment to prevent exposure keratitis. If not\ntreated adequately, the poor closure of the eyelids can result in significant\npain, corneal scarring, corneal ulcer, and ultimately corneal perforation with\na possible loss of the eye.  [4]  [5]  [6]\n\nThe orbicularis oculi muscles can also contract involuntarily in benign\nessential blepharospasm. This can severely affect a person's ability to\nperform activities of daily living, such as reading and driving, as the person\nhas a hard time holding the eyes open to see properly. Periodic\nchemodenervation of the orbicularis oculi muscle with botulinum toxin\ninjections can significantly ameliorate the symptoms.

    "content": "The extrinsic extensor muscles of the hand are located in the back of the forearm and have long tendons connecting them to bones in the hand, where they exert their action. Extrinsic denotes their location outside the hand. Extensor denotes their action which is to extend, or open flat, joints in the hand. They include the extensor carpi radialis longus (ECRL), extensor carpi radialis brevis (ECRB), extensor digitorum (ED), extensor digiti minimi (EDM), extensor carpi ulnaris (ECU), abductor pollicis longus (APL), extensor pollicis brevis (EPB), extensor pollicis longus (EPL), and extensor indicis (EI).\n\nOrigin[edit]\nThe extensor carpi radialis longus (ECRL) has the most proximal origin of the extrinsic hand extensors. It originates just distal to the brachioradialis at the lateral supracondylar ridge of the humerus, the lateral intermuscular septum, and by a few fibers at the lateral epicondyle of the humerus. Distal to this, the extensor carpi radialis brevis (ECRB), extensor digitorum, extensor digiti minimi, and extensor carpi ulnaris (ECU) originate from the lateral epicondyle via the common extensor tendon. The ECRB has additional origins from the radial collateral ligament, the ECU from the dorsal border of the ulna (shared with the flexor carpi ulnaris and flexor digitorum profundus), and all four also originate from various fascia. Moving distally, there are the abductor pollicis longus (APL), extensor pollicis brevis (EPB), extensor pollicis longus (EPL), and extensor indicis (EI). The APL originates from the lateral part of the dorsal surface of the body of the ulna below the insertion of the anconeus and from the middle third of the dorsal surface of the body of the radius. The EPB arises from the radius distal to the APL and from the dorsal surface of the radius. The EPL arises from the dorsal surface of the ulna and the EI from the distal third of the dorsal part of the body of ulna. The APL, EPB, EPL, and EI all have an additional origin at the interosseus membrane.\n\nCourse[edit]\nThe ECRL and ECRB, (with the brachioradialis) form the lateral compartment. Their muscle fibers end at the upper third and the mid forearm respectively, continuing as flat tendons along the lateral border of the radius, beneath the APL and EPB. They then pass beneath the extensor retinaculum and dorsal carpal ligament, where they lie in a groove on the back of the radius, immediately behind the styloid process, and continue into the second tendon compartment. The ED divides into four tendons which, with the EI tendons, go through the fourth tendon compartment of the dorsal carpal ligament. On the back of the hand, the ED tendons diverge to follow the fingers and the EI tendon joins the ulnar side of one of the ED tendons along the back of the index finger. The EDM takes a similar course as the EI except it follows the ED tendon along the little finger. The ECU crosses from the lateral to the medial side of the forearm. The APL and EPB pass obliquely down and lateral, ending in tendons which run through a groove on the lateral side of the lower end of the radius. The EPL tendon passes through the third compartment and lies in a narrow, oblique groove on the back of the lower end of the radius.\n\nExtensor digitorum tendons[edit]\nThe ED tendons are more complex in their course. Opposite the metacarpophalangeal joint each tendon is bound by fasciculi to the collateral ligaments and serves as the dorsal ligament of this joint; after having crossed the joint, it spreads out into a broad aponeurosis, which covers the dorsal surface of the first phalanx and is reinforced, in this situation, by the tendons of the Interossei and Lumbricalis.\nOpposite the first interphalangeal joints this aponeurosis divides into three slips; an intermediate and two collateral: the former is inserted into the base of the second phalanx; and the two collateral, which are continued onward along the sides of the second phalanx, unite by their contiguous margins, and are inserted into the dorsal surface of the last phalanx. As the tendons cross the interphalangeal joints, they furnish them with dorsal ligaments. The tendon to the index finger is accompanied by the EI, which lies on its ulnar side. On the back of the hand, the tendons to the middle, ring, and little fingers are connected by two obliquely placed bands, one from the third tendon passing downward and lateralward to the second tendon, and the other passing from the same tendon downward and medialward to the fourth.\nOccasionally the first tendon is connected to the second by a thin transverse band. Collectively, these are known as the sagittal bands; they serve to maintain the central alignment of the extensor tendons over the metacarpal head, thus increasing the available leverage. Injuries (such as by an external flexion force during active extension) may allow the tendon to dislocate into the intermetacarpal space; the extensor tendon then acts as a flexor and the finger may no longer be actively extended. This may be corrected surgically by using a slip of the extensor tendon to replace the damaged ligamentous band\n\nAnatomical snuff box[edit]\n\nMain article: anatomical snuff box\nThe EPL tendon crosses obliquely the tendons of the ECRL and ECRB, and is separated from the EPB by a triangular interval, the anatomical snuff box, in which the radial artery is found.\n\nInsertion and action[edit]\nInsertions\nThe ECRL inserts into the dorsal surface of the base of the second metacarpal bone on its radial side to extend and abduct the wrist. The ECRB inserts into the lateral dorsal surface of the base of the third metacarpal bone, with a few fibres inserting into the medial dorsal surface of the second metacarpal bone, also to extend and abduct the wrist. The ED inserts into the middle and distal phalanges to extend the fingers and wrist. Opposite the head of the second metacarpal bone, the EI joins the ulnar side of the ED tendon to extend the index finger. The EDM has a similar role for the little finger. The ECU inserts at the base of the 5th metacarpal to extend and adduct the wrist. The APL inserts into the radial side of the base of the first metacarpal bone to abduct the thumb at the carpometacarpal joint and may continue to abduct the wrist. The EPB inserts into the base of the first phalanx of the thumb to extend and abduct the thumb at the carpometacarpal and MCP joints.\nThe EPL inserts on the base of the distal phalanx of the thumb. It uses the dorsal tubercle on the radius as fulcrum to help the EPB with its action as well as extending the distal phalanx of the thumb. Because the index finger and little finger have separate extensors, these fingers can be moved more independently than the other fingers.\n\nNeurovascular supply[edit]\nThe ECU is supplied by the ulnar artery. The APL, EPB, EPL, EI, ED, and EDM are supplied by the Posterior interosseous artery, a branch of the ulnar artery. The ECRL and ECRB receive blood from the radial artery.\nThe ECRL is supplied by the radial nerve and the ECRB by its deep branch. The remaining extrinsic hand extensors are supplied by the posterior interosseus nerve, another branch of the radial nerve.\n\nSummary table[edit]\nMuscle\n\nOrigin\n\nInsertion\n\nArtery\n\nNerve\n\nAction\n\nAntagonist\n\nGray's\n\n\nExtensor carpi radialis longus\n\nlateral supracondylar ridge\n\n2nd metacarpal, base\n\nradial\n\nradial\n\nextends, abducts wrist\n\nFCRM\n\ns125p452\n\n\nExtensor carpi radialis brevis\n\ncommon extensor tendon\n\n3rd metacarpal, base\n\nradial nerve, deep branch\n\n\nExtensor digitorum\n\nextensor expansion of 2nd\u20135th middle, distal phalanges\n\nposterior interosseus\n\nposterior interosseus\n\nextends fingers, wrist\n\nFDS, FDP\n\ns125p451\n\n\nExtensor digiti minimi\n\nextensor expansion, base of proximal phalanx, little finger\n\nextends little finger at all joints\n\nFDMB\n\n\nExtensor carpi ulnaris\n\ncommon extensor tendon, ulna\n\n5th metacarpal, base\n\nulnar\n\nextends, adducts wrist\n\nFCU\n\ns125p454\n\n\nAbductor pollicis longus\n\nulna, radius, interosseous membrane\n\nfirst metacarpal, base\n\nposterior interosseus\n\nabducts, extends thumb\n\nAP\n\ns125p455\n\n\nExtensor pollicis brevis\n\nproximal phalanx, thumb\n\nextends thumb at MCP joint\n\nFPL, FPB\n\n\nExtensor pollicis longus\n\nulna, interosseous membrane\n\nthumb, distal phalanx\n\nextends thumb at MCP and IP joint\n\nFPL, FPB\n\n\nExtensor indicis\n\nindex finger, extensor hood\n\nextends index finger, wrist\n\nSee also[edit]\nExtensor digitorum reflex"

It uses substances made by the\nbody or in a laboratory to boost the immune system and help the body find and\ndestroy cancer cells.\n\nImmunotherapy can treat many different types of cancer. It can be used alone\nor in combination with chemotherapy and/or other cancer treatments.\n\nThis article will help you understand the basics of how immunotherapy works to\ntreat cancer. Learn more about the [ side effects of immunotherapy\n](/node/35996) .\n\n###  How does the immune system fight cancer?\n\nThe immune system consists of a complex process that your body uses to fight\ncancer. This process involves cells, organs, and proteins. Cancer can commonly\nget around many of the immune system's natural defenses, allowing cancer cells\nto continue to grow.\n\nDifferent types of immunotherapy work in different ways. Some immunotherapy\ntreatments help the immune system stop or slow the growth of cancer cells.\nOthers help the immune system destroy cancer cells or stop the cancer from\nspreading to other parts of the body.\n\nThe different types of immunotherapy include:\n\n* [ Monoclonal antibodies and immune checkpoint inhibitors ](https://www.cancer.net/navigating-cancer-care/how-cancer-treated/immunotherapy-and-vaccines/what-immunotherapy#monoclonal-antibodies-immune-checkpoint-inhibitors)\n\n* [ Non-specific immunotherapies ](https://www.cancer.net/navigating-cancer-care/how-cancer-treated/immunotherapy-and-vaccines/what-immunotherapy#non-specific)\n\n* [ Oncolytic virus therapy ](https://www.cancer.net/navigating-cancer-care/how-cancer-treated/immunotherapy-and-vaccines/what-immunotherapy#oncolytic-virus-therapy)\n\n* [ T-cell therapy ](https://www.cancer.net/navigating-cancer-care/how-cancer-treated/immunotherapy-and-vaccines/what-immunotherapy#t-cell-therapy)\n\n* [ Cancer vaccines ](https://www.cancer.net/navigating-cancer-care/how-cancer-treated/immunotherapy-and-vaccines/what-immunotherapy#cancer-vaccines)\n\nThe type of immunotherapy, dose, and treatment schedule your doctor recommends\nwill depend on many factors. These can include the type of cancer, size,\nlocation, and where it has spread. Your age, general health, [ body weight\n](https://www.asco.org/practice-patients/guidelines/supportive-care-and-\ntreatment-related-issues#/9976) , and the possible side effects are also\nimportant. Talk with your doctor about why a specific immunotherapy plan is\nbeing recommended for you.\n\n###  What are monoclonal antibodies and immune checkpoint inhibitors?\n\nWhen the immune system detects something harmful, it makes antibodies.\nAntibodies are proteins that fight infection by attaching to antigens.\nAntigens are molecules that start the immune response in your body.\n\nMonoclonal antibodies are made in a laboratory to boost the body's natural\nantibodies or act as antibodies themselves. Monoclonal antibodies can help\nfight cancer in different ways. For example, they can be used to block the\nactivity of abnormal proteins in cancer cells. This is also considered a type\nof [ targeted therapy ](/node/24729) , which is a cancer treatment using\nmedication that targets a cancer's specific genes, proteins, or the tissue\nenvironment that helps the tumor grow and survive.\n\nOther types of monoclonal antibodies boost your immune system by inhibiting or\nstopping immune checkpoints. Immune checkpoints are used by the body to\nnaturally stop an immune system response and prevent the immune system from\nattacking healthy cells. Cancer cells can find ways to hide from the immune\nsystem by activating these checkpoints.\n\nCheckpoint inhibitors prevent cancer cells from blocking the immune system.\nCommon checkpoints that these inhibitors affect are the PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4\npathways.\n\nExamples of immune checkpoint inhibitors include:\n\n* Atezolizumab (Tecentriq)\n\n* Avelumab (Bavencio)\n\n* Dostarlizumab (Jemperli)\n\n* Durvalumab (Imfinzi)\n\n* Ipilimumab (Yervoy)\n\n* Nivolumab (Opdivo)\n\n* Pembrolizumab (Keytruda)\n\nMany checkpoint inhibitors are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug\nAdministration (FDA) for specific cancers. There are also 2 checkpoint\ninhibitors that are used to treat tumors anywhere in the body if they have\nspecific genetic changes. This kind of approach is called a \"tumor-agnostic\ntreatment.\"\n\nFor instance, pembrolizumab (Keytruda) is approved to treat any tumors that\nhave spread to distant parts of the body if they have a specific molecular\nchange called microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or DNA mismatch repair\ndeficiency (dMMR). Another example is that dostarlimab (Jemperli) can be used\nfor advanced cancer or cancer that has come back if it has dMMR. Learn more\nabout [ tumor-agnostic treatments ](/node/39106) .\n\nThe side effects of monoclonal antibody treatment depend on the drug's\npurpose. For example, the side effects of monoclonal antibodies used for\ntargeted therapy are not like those used for immunotherapy. The side effects\nof immune checkpoint inhibitors may include side effects similar to an\nallergic reaction. Learn more about [ side effects of immune checkpoint\ninhibitors ](/node/41856) .\n\n[ _Return to top_ ](https://www.cancer.net/navigating-cancer-care/how-cancer-\ntreated/immunotherapy-and-vaccines/what-immunotherapy#main-content)\n\n###  What are non-specific immunotherapies?\n\nNon-specific immunotherapies, also called non-specific immunomodulating\nagents, help your immune system destroy cancer cells. There are several kinds\nof non-specific immunotherapies that work in different ways.\n\n**Cytokines.** Cytokines are a part of the immune system. They are proteins\nthat send messages between cells to activate the immune system. There are two\ntypes of cytokines that are used to treat cancer:\n\n* **Interferons.** These proteins are produced by your immune system to alert your body that there is a pathogen, typically a virus, in your body. Interferons can be made in a laboratory to help your immune system fight cancer. They can also slow the growth of cancer cells.\n\nThe most common type of interferon used in cancer treatment is called\ninterferon alpha (Roferon-A [2a], Intron A [2b], Alferon [2a]). Interferon can\nbe used to several many different types of cancer. Side effects of interferon\ntreatment may include flu-like symptoms, an increased risk of infection, skin\nrashes, and hair thinning.\n\n* **Interleukins.** Interleukins are proteins that pass messages between cells. They also start an immune response. For example, the lab-made interleukin-2 (IL-2) or aldesleukin (Proleukin) can treat [ kidney cancer ](/node/18976) and [ melanoma ](/node/19258) . Common side effects of IL-2 treatment include weight gain and low blood pressure. Some people also experience flu-like symptoms.\n\n**Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG).** This type of immunotherapy is similar to\nthe bacteria that causes tuberculosis. It is used to treat [ bladder cancer\n](/node/18527) . BCG is placed directly into the bladder through a catheter.\nIt attaches to the inside lining of the bladder and activates the immune\nsystem to destroy tumor cells. BCG can cause flu-like symptoms.\n\n[ _Return to top_ ](https://www.cancer.net/navigating-cancer-care/how-cancer-\ntreated/immunotherapy-and-vaccines/what-immunotherapy#main-content)\n\n###  What is oncolytic virus therapy?\n\nOncolytic virus therapy, sometimes just called virus therapy, uses viruses\nthat have been changed in a laboratory to destroy cancer cells. A genetically\nmodified version of the virus is injected into the tumor. When the virus\nenters the cancer cells, it makes a copy of itself. As a result, the cancer\ncells burst and die. As the cells die, they release proteins that trigger your\nimmune system to target any cancer cells in your body that have the same\nproteins as the dead cancer cells. The virus does not enter healthy cells.\n\nCurrently, one type of oncolytic virus therapy is approved in the United\nStates to treat cancer:\n\n**Talimogene laherparepvec (Imlygic) or T-VEC.** This oncolytic virus therapy\nis approved to treat advanced melanoma that cannot be treated with surgery. It\nis used most often for people who cannot or choose not to receive any other\nrecommended treatments. T-VEC is a modified version of the herpes simplex\nvirus, which causes cold sores. It is injected directly into 1 or more\nmelanoma tumors. Side effects of oncolytic virus therapy include flu-like\nsymptoms and pain at the injection site.\n\n[ Clinical trials ](/node/24863) are testing other oncolytic viruses for\ndifferent cancers. They are also testing how the viruses work with other\ncancer treatments, such as chemotherapy.\n\n[ _Return to top_ ](https://www.cancer.net/navigating-cancer-care/how-cancer-\ntreated/immunotherapy-and-vaccines/what-immunotherapy#main-content)\n\n###  What is T-cell therapy?\n\nT cells are immune cells that fight infection. In T-cell therapy, the doctor\nremoves T cells from the blood. Then, a laboratory adds specific proteins\ncalled receptors to the cells. The receptor allows those T cells to recognize\ncancer cells. The changed T cells are put back into the body. Once there, they\nfind and destroy cancer cells. This type of therapy is known as chimeric\nantigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy. Side effects include fevers, confusion,\nlow blood pressure, and, in rare occasions, seizures.\n\nCAR T-cell therapy is used to treat certain blood cancers. Researchers are\nstill studying this type of therapy and other ways of changing T cells to\ntreat cancer. Learn more about [ the basics of CAR T-cell therapy\n](/node/41721) .\n\n[ _Return to top_ ](https://www.cancer.net/navigating-cancer-care/how-cancer-\ntreated/immunotherapy-and-vaccines/what-immunotherapy#main-content)\n\n###  What are cancer vaccines?\n\nA cancer vaccine can also help your body fight disease. A vaccine exposes your\nimmune system to a foreign protein, called an antigen. This triggers the\nimmune system to recognize and destroy that antigen or related substances.\nThere are 2 types of cancer vaccine: prevention vaccines and treatment\nvaccines.\n\nOne example of a cancer prevention vaccine is Gardasil, the vaccine to protect\nagainst the [ human papillomavirus (HPV) ](/node/24561) , a virus that can\ncause specific types of cancer. An example of a treatment vaccine includes [\nspuleucel-T (Provenge) ](https://www.cancer.net/cancer-types/prostate-\ncancer/types-treatment) , which treats advanced prostate cancer that does not\nrespond to hormone therapy. T-VEC (see above) is also considered a cancer\ntreatment vaccine. Side effects for both of these cancer vaccines are flu-like\nsymptoms.\n\n[ _Return to top_ ](https://www.cancer.net/navigating-cancer-care/how-cancer-\ntreated/immunotherapy-and-vaccines/what-immunotherapy#main-content)\n\nIn general, immunotherapy is an important approach as cancer researchers\ncontinue to look for new cancer treatments. The examples above do not include\nevery type of immunotherapy treatment. Researchers are studying many new\ndrugs. You can learn more about immunotherapy in each [ cancer-specific\nsection on Cancer.Net ](https://www.cancer.net/cancer-types) . Look at the\n\"Types of Treatment\" and \"Latest Research\" pages for specific information\nabout immunotherapy for that type of cancer. You can also learn about the\nlatest [ immunotherapy research on the Cancer.Net Blog\n](https://www.cancer.net/blog/tags/immunotherapy) .\n\n###  Questions to ask your health care team\n\nIf immunotherapy is a cancer treatment option for you, consider asking your\nhealth care team these questions:\n\n* What type of immunotherapy do you recommend? Why?\n\n* What are the goals of this treatment?\n\n* What immunotherapy clinical trials are open to me?\n\n* Will immunotherapy be my only type of cancer treatment? If not, what other treatments will I need? When?\n\n* How will I receive immunotherapy treatment?\n\n* Where will I receive this treatment?\n\n* How long will each treatment take? How often will I need to get this treatment?\n\n* What are the possible short-term side effects of immunotherapy? How can these be managed?\n\n* Who should I talk with about any side effects I experience? How soon?\n\n* What side effects should I let you know about right away?\n\n* Whom should I call with questions or problems?\n\n* How can I reach them during regular business hours? After hours?\n\n* How will this treatment affect my daily life? Will I be able to work, exercise, and do my usual activities?\n\n* If I'm very worried or anxious about having this treatment, who can I talk with?\n\n* If I'm worried about managing the cost of this treatment, who can help me?\n\n* What are possible long-term side effects of this immunotherapy? How can these be managed?\n\n* How will we know if this immunotherapy is working?\n\n* Will I need any tests or scans before, during, or after immunotherapy?\n\n* Could the dose or duration of my immunotherapy change over time?\n\n###  Related Resources\n\n[ ASCO Answers Fact Sheet: Understanding Immunotherapy (PDF)\n](https://www.cancer.net/sites/cancer.net/files/asco_answers_immunotherapy.pdf)\n\n[ Side Effects of Immunotherapy ](https://www.cancer.net/node/35996)\n\n###  More Information\n\n[ American Cancer Society: Cancer Immunotherapy\n](https://www.cancer.org/treatment/treatments-and-side-effects/treatment-\ntypes/immunotherapy.html)\n\n[ National Cancer Institute: Biologic Therapies\n](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/types/immunotherapy/bio-\ntherapies-fact-sheet?redirect=true)\n\n[ Espa\u00f1ol ](/es/desplazarse-por-atenci%C3%B3n-del-c%C3%A1ncer/como-se-trata-\nel-c%C3%A1ncer/inmunoterapia-y-vacunas/que-es-la-inmunoterapia \"\u00bfQu\u00e9 es la\ninmunoterapia?\")\n\n![ASCO Answers: Understanding\nImmunotherapy](https://www.cancer.net/sites/cancer.net/files/fs_understanding_immunotherapy_2019_bookstore_500x500.jpg)\nDownload a free fact sheet on [ Understanding Immunotherapy (PDF)\n](https://www.cancer.net/sites/cancer.net/files/asco_answers_immunotherapy.pdf)\n.

    "content": "A nerve is an enclosed, cable-like bundle of nerve fibers (called axons) in the peripheral nervous system.\nNerves have historically been considered the basic units of the peripheral nervous system. A nerve provides a common pathway for the electrochemical nerve impulses called action potentials that are transmitted along each of the axons to peripheral organs or, in the case of sensory nerves, from the periphery back to the central nervous system. Each axon, within the nerve, is an extension of an individual neuron, along with other supportive cells such as some Schwann cells that coat the axons in myelin.\nWithin a nerve, each axon is surrounded by a layer of connective tissue called the endoneurium. The axons are bundled together into groups called fascicles, and each fascicle is wrapped in a layer of connective tissue called the perineurium. Finally, the entire nerve is wrapped in a layer of connective tissue called the epineurium. Nerve cells (often called neurons) are further classified as sensory, motor, or mixed nerves.\nIn the central nervous system, the analogous structures are known as nerve tracts.\n\nStructure[edit]\nCross-section of a nerve\nEach nerve is covered on the outside by a dense sheath of connective tissue, the epineurium. Beneath this is a layer of fat cells, the perineurium, which forms a complete sleeve around a bundle of axons. Perineurial septae extend into the nerve and subdivide it into several bundles of fibres. Surrounding each such fibre is the endoneurium. This forms an unbroken tube from the surface of the spinal cord to the level where the axon synapses with its muscle fibres, or ends in sensory receptors. The endoneurium consists of an inner sleeve of material called the glycocalyx and an outer, delicate, meshwork of collagen fibres. Nerves are bundled and often travel along with blood vessels, since the neurons of a nerve have fairly high energy requirements.\nWithin the endoneurium, the individual nerve fibres are surrounded by a low-protein liquid called endoneurial fluid. This acts in a similar way to the cerebrospinal fluid in the central nervous system and constitutes a blood-nerve barrier similar to the blood\u2013brain barrier. Molecules are thereby prevented from crossing the blood into the endoneurial fluid. During the development of nerve edema from nerve irritation (or injury), the amount of endoneurial fluid may increase at the site of irritation. This increase in fluid can be visualized using magnetic resonance neurography, and thus MR neurography can identify nerve irritation and/or injury.\nCategories[edit]\nNerves are categorized into three groups based on the direction that signals are conducted:\nAfferent nerves conduct signals from sensory neurons to the central nervous system, for example from the mechanoreceptors in skin.\nEfferent nerves conduct signals from the central nervous system along motor neurons to their target muscles and glands.\nMixed nerves contain both afferent and efferent axons, and thus conduct both incoming sensory information and outgoing muscle commands in the same bundle. All spinal nerves are mixed nerves, and some of the cranial nerves are also mixed nerves.\nNerves can be categorized into two groups based on where they connect to the central nervous system:\nSpinal nerves innervate (distribute to/stimulate) much of the body, and connect through the vertebral column to the spinal cord and thus to the central nervous system. They are given letter-number designations according to the vertebra through which they connect to the spinal column.\nCranial nerves innervate parts of the head, and connect directly to the brain (especially to the brainstem). They are typically assigned Roman numerals from 1 to 12, although cranial nerve zero is sometimes included. In addition, cranial nerves have descriptive names.\nTerminology[edit]\n\nMain article: Anatomical terms of neuroanatomy\nSpecific terms are used to describe nerves and their actions. A nerve that supplies information to the brain from an area of the body, or controls an action of the body is said to innervate that section of the body or organ. Other terms relate to whether the nerve affects the same side (\"ipsilateral\") or opposite side (\"contralateral\") of the body, to the part of the brain that supplies it.\n\nDevelopment[edit]\nNerve growth normally ends in adolescence, but can be re-stimulated with a molecular mechanism known as \"Notch signaling\".\nRegeneration[edit]\nIf the axons of a neuron are damaged, as long as the cell body of the neuron is not damaged, the axons can regenerate and remake the synaptic connections with neurons with the help of guidepost cells. This is also referred to as neuroregeneration.\nThe nerve begins the process by destroying the nerve distal to the site of injury allowing Schwann cells, basal lamina, and the neurilemma near the injury to begin producing a regeneration tube. Nerve growth factors are produced causing many nerve sprouts to bud.  When one of the growth processes finds the regeneration tube, it begins to grow rapidly towards its original destination guided the entire time by the regeneration tube. Nerve regeneration is very slow and can take up to several months to complete. While this process does repair some nerves, there will still be some functional deficit as the repairs are not perfect.\n\nFunction[edit]\nA nerve conveys information in the form of electrochemical impulses (as nerve impulses known as action potentials) carried by the individual neurons that make up the nerve. These impulses are extremely fast, with some myelinated neurons conducting at speeds up to 120\u00a0m/s. The impulses travel from one neuron to another by crossing a synapse, where the message is converted from electrical to chemical and then back to electrical.\nNerves can be categorized into two groups based on function:\nAn afferent nerve fiber conducts sensory information from a sensory neuron to the central nervous system, where the information is then processed. Bundles of fibres or axons, in the peripheral nervous system are called nerves, and bundles of afferent fibers are known as sensory nerves.\nAn efferent nerve fiber conducts signals from a motor neuron in the central nervous system to muscles. Bundles of these fibres  are known as efferent nerves.\nNervous system[edit]\n\nMain article: Nervous system\nThe nervous system is the part of an animal that coordinates its actions by transmitting signals to and from different parts of its body. In vertebrates it consists of two main parts, the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS). The CNS consists of the brain, brainstem and spinal cord. The PNS consists mainly of nerves, which are enclosed bundles of the long fibers or axons, that connect the CNS to all remaining body parts.\nNerves that transmit signals from the CNS are called motor or efferent nerves, while those nerves that transmit information from the body to the CNS are called sensory or afferent. Spinal nerves serve both functions and are called mixed nerves. The PNS is divided into three separate subsystems, the somatic, autonomic, and enteric nervous systems. Somatic nerves mediate voluntary movement.\nThe autonomic nervous system is further subdivided into the sympathetic and the parasympathetic nervous systems. The sympathetic nervous system is activated in cases of emergencies to mobilize energy, while the parasympathetic nervous system is activated when organisms are in a relaxed state. The enteric nervous system functions to control the gastrointestinal system. Both autonomic and enteric nervous systems function involuntarily. Nerves that exit from the cranium are called cranial nerves while those exiting from the spinal cord are called spinal nerves.\n\nClinical significance[edit]\nMicrograph demonstrating perineural invasion of prostate cancer. H&E stain.\nCancer can spread by invading the spaces around nerves. This is particularly common in head and neck cancer, prostate cancer and colorectal cancer.\nNerves can be damaged by physical injury as well as conditions like carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) and repetitive strain injury. Autoimmune diseases such as Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome, neurodegenerative diseases, polyneuropathy, infection, neuritis, diabetes, or failure of the blood vessels surrounding the nerve all cause nerve damage, which can vary in severity.\nMultiple sclerosis is a disease associated with extensive nerve damage. It occurs when the macrophages of an individual's own immune system damage the myelin sheaths that insulate the axon of the nerve.\nA pinched nerve occurs when pressure is placed on a nerve, usually from swelling due to an injury, or pregnancy and can result in pain, weakness, numbness or paralysis, an example being CTS. Symptoms can be felt in areas far from the actual site of damage, a phenomenon called referred pain. Referred pain can happen when the damage causes altered signalling to other areas.\nNeurologists usually diagnose disorders of nerves by a physical examination, including the testing of reflexes, walking and other directed movements, muscle weakness, proprioception, and the sense of touch. This initial exam can be followed with tests such as nerve conduction study, electromyography (EMG), and computed tomography (CT).\n\nOther animals[edit]\nA neuron is called identified if it has properties that distinguish it from every other neuron in the same animal\u2014properties such as location, neurotransmitter, gene expression pattern, and connectivity\u2014and if every individual organism belonging to the same species has exactly one neuron with the same set of properties.  In vertebrate nervous systems, very few neurons are \"identified\" in this sense. Researchers believe humans have none\u2014but in simpler nervous systems, some or all neurons may be thus unique.\nIn vertebrates, the best known identified neurons are the gigantic Mauthner cells of fish.  Every fish has two Mauthner cells, located in the bottom part of the brainstem, one on the left side and one on the right.  Each Mauthner cell has an axon that crosses over, innervating (stimulating) neurons at the same brain level and then travelling down through the spinal cord, making numerous connections as it goes.  The synapses generated by a Mauthner cell are so powerful that a single action potential gives rise to a major behavioral response:  within milliseconds the fish curves its body into a C-shape, then straightens, thereby propelling itself rapidly forward.  Functionally this is a fast escape response, triggered most easily by a strong sound wave or pressure wave impinging on the lateral line organ of the fish.  Mauthner cells are not the only identified neurons in fish\u2014there are about 20 more types, including pairs of \"Mauthner cell analogs\" in each spinal segmental nucleus.  Although a Mauthner cell is capable of bringing about an escape response all by itself, in the context of ordinary behavior other types of cells usually contribute to shaping the amplitude and direction of the response.\nMauthner cells have been described as command neurons.  A command neuron is a special type of identified neuron, defined as a neuron that is capable of driving a specific behavior all by itself.  Such neurons appear most commonly in the fast escape systems of various species\u2014the squid giant axon and squid giant synapse, used for pioneering experiments in neurophysiology because of their enormous size, both participate in the fast escape circuit of the squid.  The concept of a command neuron has, however, become controversial, because of studies showing that some neurons that initially appeared to fit the description were really only capable of evoking a response in a limited set of  circumstances.\nIn organisms of radial symmetry, nerve nets serve for the nervous system. There is no brain or centralised head region, and instead there are interconnected neurons spread out in nerve nets. These are found in Cnidaria, Ctenophora and Echinodermata.\n\nHistory[edit]\n\nFurther information: History of neurology and neurosurgery\nHerophilos (335\u2013280 BC) described the functions of the optic nerve in sight and the oculomotor nerve in eye movement. Analysis of the nerves in the cranium enabled him to differentiate between blood vessels and nerves (Ancient Greek: \u03bd\u03b5\u1fe6\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd (ne\u00fbron) \"string, plant fiber, nerve\").\nModern research has not confirmed William Cullen's 1785 hypothesis associating mental states with physical nerves, although popular or lay medicine may still invoke \"nerves\" in diagnosing or blaming any sort of psychological worry or hesitancy, as in the common traditional phrases \"my poor nerves\",\n\"high-strung\", and \"nervous breakdown\".\n\nSee also[edit]\nBiology portal\nConnective tissue in the peripheral nervous system\nDermatome (anatomy)\nList of nerves of the human body\nNerve injury\nNeuropathy\nNerve injury classification"

For sure, it was bit and had at least mechanical damage from a fang,\nas evidenced by the blood droplet and slight but dintinct swelling nodule.

Changes of these patterns due to ageing are compared with variations of transition probabilities due to sleep disorder.\n\n1. Introduction\nHumans spend a third of their life asleep. Sleep is a time of non-consciousness with its own structure and microstructure consisting of sleep stages, which may be identified by analysing brain waves. For this purpose, brain waves are recorded in a standardized way according to the manual of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine [1]. The recordings include an electroencephalogram (EEG) from at least three leads with well-defined positions on the cortex, an electrooculogram (EOG) from two leads near the eyes and an electromyogram (EMG) with two leads from a submental or mental muscle. Sleep stages are associated with distinct wave patterns, which may be classified according to the Rechtschaffen and Kales scheme [2] as summarized in table 1.\n\nTable 1.\nRechtschaffen and Kales classification scheme of sleep stages [2], which is used in this publication. In 2007, stages N3 and N4 were merged into a single class [1,3].\n\nView inlineView popup\nClassification of sleep stages (sleep staging) based on EEG signals is obtained by visual inspection by trained technicians. In order to reduce the effort related to visual scoring, sleep stages are scored in 30\u2009s epochs, effectively limiting the temporal resolution of visual classification. Another limitation of visual scoring is the uncertainty introduced during the classification process [4]. Especially sleep stages that had been scored by different sleep laboratories often show some differences. This ambiguity can be reduced by systematic training of sleep staging personnel, which indeed improves the visual classification [5]. Furthermore, efforts are made to improve sleep classification through new internet-based sleep scoring [6].\n\nSleep stages occur in a systematic manner during night sleep. First, a short period of wakefulness (W) is observed with eyes closed before the subject falls asleep. This may last for 5\u201320\u2009min in healthy subjects. Then follows a short period of N1 as a transitional state and then stage N2, which may be longer. Stage N2 is typically followed by N3 (and N4), deep-sleep stages that are needed for physical recreation. After that a short period of REM sleep is observed and then often a very short awakening. This sequence is called a sleep cycle with a duration of roughly 90\u2009min and it is repeated five to six times during the night. Sleep is often interrupted by very brief awakenings. Usually, they are so short that they are not remembered and good sleep is experienced. The longer the awakenings are the more likely they are realized and memorized which leads to a feeling of disturbed sleep.\n\nCurrent evaluations of sleep consider mainly the following periods of time:\n\n\u2014\u2003sleep onset latency=duration of wakefulness before first occurrence of sleep stages,\n\n\u2014\u2003REM sleep latency=time until first occurrence of REM sleep,\n\n\u2014\u2003time in bed=time between intention to sleep/lights off and wake up/lights on,\n\n\u2014\u2003total sleep time=all sleep stages together except wake times, and\n\n\u2014\u2003the percentages spent in the different sleep stages.\n\nIn general, we know that healthy middle-aged people spend approximately 5\u201310% of the night awake, 10% in N1, 50% in N2, 15\u201320% in N3/N4 and 15\u201320% in REM sleep. Other quantities which are sometimes considered in publications take the number of awakenings or the number of transitions between sleep stages into account. The current focus in sleep science, however, is on durations and latencies of sleep stages that may change due to ageing and sleep disorder. This is reflected in clinical reports of sleep recordings which only present percentages of sleep stages and sleep latencies.\n\nMany sleep disorders, however, also result in changes of sleep transitions. These sleep transitions and the time spent in a specific sleep stage have been analysed previously [7], not only in humans but also in animals and some universal laws have been found and described [8]. It is also known that sleep changes with age. A meta-analysis of sleep studies presented the changes in parameters that are commonly reported [9]. From this analysis, we know that the duration of slow wave sleep (N3 and N4) and the percentage of dream sleep (REM) decreases with age. We know that the amount of light sleep (N1 and N2) as well as time spent awake (W) increases with age. This seems to be a normal ageing process. But how does the frequency and the pattern of transitions between sleep stages change during ageing or with sleep disorder?\n\nSingle-step transitions between sleep stages have been previously studied by Kemp et al. [10], who investigated transition probabilities between stages. A different approach, with a more global perspective, is the overall analysis of spectral entropy measures for sleep-stage transitions provided by Kirsch et al. [11]. In their study, they relate the Walsh spectral entropy (WSE) and the Haar spectral entropy (HSE) to traditional sleep quality parameters such as arousal index and sleep efficacy. They also compare the new parameters to daytime sleepiness and correlate them with traditional sleep quality measures. Lo et al. [8] investigated transitions between wakefulness and sleep during the sleep period in order to derive models for the process of sleep stages (where Lo et al. reduced the transitions to wake\u2013sleep transitions, only, by lumping all sleep stages into one class). To gain further insight into transition patterns including multistep transitions between sleep stages we analyse in the following sleep data employing symbolic dynamics.\n\nSymbolic dynamics enables flexible data-driven strategies for signal analysis and classification, thus providing a solid basis for the quantification of the complexity of dynamical processes [12,13] with many applications in different scientific fields [14,15]. In those cases where the raw data are given by time series of real-valued samples (e.g. blood pressure, beat-to-beat intervals, EEG channels) some method of coarse graining is required to transform the data into a sequence of symbols aiming at enhancing certain signal features while discarding unessential details. By contrast, the sleep stages considered here already provide a natural symbolic representation (table 1) determined by human sleep staging based on the original EEG, EOG and EMG recordings.\n\nThis symbolic representation of the sleep process is the starting point of the sleep analysis presented in the following. In \u00a72, the dataset is introduced and an overview of the periods of time spent in different sleep stages is presented. Then in \u00a73a, we focus on an analysis of one-step transition probabilities between sleep stages using transition matrices and joint entropies. In \u00a73b, we present results obtained employing spectral entropy measures. In \u00a73c, changes of transition patterns due to ageing and sleep disorders are discussed using network representations. Section 4 expands the concept of transition probabilities to two-step transitions and visualizes differences between groups. Finally, in \u00a75, the general question of the appropriate number of steps needed in this type of symbolic analysis of sleep stages is addressed by performing a Markov order test. In \u00a76, all results are summarized and discussed.\n\n2. Data\nIn order to investigate statistics for sleep stages and sleep transitions, it is important to have high-quality data. This means signals have to be recorded without artefacts and then human sleep scoring using these signals has to be correct and reliable. The latter is done by trained sleep technicians as a typical medical classification task with all kinds of limitations inherent to visual medical classification. From previous studies, it is known that there is a considerable human error in the classification of sleep stages [16]. Therefore, the Siesta project [17,18] funded by the European Community was initiated to record high-quality sleep in humans and provide an accurate and robust sleep classification. In order to compare the sleep of healthy subjects to clinical findings, the Siesta project recorded the sleep of patients with sleep disorders as well. Patients with sleep disorders accounted for half the number of healthy subjects, however. The sleep classification was performed independently by two sleep technicians and thereafter checked by a third sleep scorer. The third scorer made a final decision only at those epochs where the two initial scorers disagreed.\n\nThe sleep recordings for this analysis were recorded from 196 healthy subjects, who were more or less equally distributed over four age classes. An effort was made to include a similar number of male and female subjects. All subjects were recorded in a sleep center for two subsequent nights using cardiorespiratory polysomnography with EEG, EOG, EMG for at least 6\u2009h and usually 8\u2009h, if possible [18]. In addition to this, 98 subjects with different sleep disorders were recorded using the same protocol including subjects with sleep apnoea, insomnia, restless legs syndrome, periodic leg movements, depression and anxiety disorders.\n\nFigure 1 shows relative durations of sleep stages for four age quartiles, distinguishing subjects with normal sleep from those with sleep disorder. For all age quartiles the fraction of N1 sleep is larger for patients suffering from sleep disorder compared with normal subjects. The fractions of sleep stages reflect well what has been described previously. With increasing age the percentage of R sleep decreases steadily. This observation has already been described by Ohayon et al. in their meta-analysis [9]. In addition, in all age classes the percentage of REM sleep is lower in patients with sleep disorders compared with healthy subjects. The percentage of wakefulness (W) during the sleep period steadily increases with age. However, the percentages of wakefulness in healthy subjects and patients with sleep disorders differ only slightly. Only for the oldest subjects were marked differences observed between normal subjects and patients with sleep disorders. This is a clear indication that among elderly subjects more patients with insomnia were observed whereas among the younger subjects more patients with sleep disordered breathing and other sleep disorders are seen.\n\nFigure 1.\nFigure 1. Fractions of duration of sleep stages awake (W), non-REM1 (N1), non-REM2 (N2), non-REM3 (N3), non-REM4 (N4) and REM (R) in four different age classes (20\u201337, 38\u201351, 52\u201364, 65\u201395). The left bar in each group gives the average result for the corresponding age quartile, while the bars in the middle (frame in blue) and the bars on the right (frame in red) represent results for normal subjects and subjects with sleep disorder, respectively.

One-step transitions\n(a) Transition probabilities and transition entropies\nIn this section, we analyse the one-step transition probabilities between sleep stages. These probabilities are computed as the number of transitions between one source and one destination stage divided by the total number of transitions in the symbolic sequence of sleep stages (of a given dataset). Note that in \u00a73a,c only transitions observed in the time series are counted, which results in the loss of information about the duration of sleep stages. By contrast, the spectral entropies presented in \u00a73b explicitly cover information about durations. It is also important to point out that the analysis has been performed on a per-dataset basis, where transition matrices are computed for each night of each individual. From these transition matrices of different datasets mean transition matrices are computed by averaging the probabilities of all transitions over all datasets in the group of interest.\n\nFigure 2 shows transition matrices obtained by averaging the transition probabilities between different sleep stages in each of the four classes: Young/Normal, Young/Sleep Disorder, Old/Normal, and Old/Sleep Disorder. One can see that the cells next to the diagonal have highest probability which shows that usually transitions occur into the neighbouring stage, except for stage R. Another apparent feature is the asymmetry between the upper and the lower diagonals which reflect the general tendency to pass the sleep stages from wakefulness to deep sleep in the order of adjacent stages. In the opposite direction, transitions to REM sleep, wakefulness or lighter sleep stages which are non-adjacent are more likely. Young healthy subjects have the highest probabilities for transitions in and out of N3 and N4. This corresponds to figure 1, which shows that these subjects have the highest percentage of N3 and N4 in the night and therefore it is likely that they also have the highest transition rates.\n\nFigure 2.\nFigure 2. Average transition probabilities (colour coded) between sleep stages awake (W), non-REM 1 (N1), non-REM 2 (N2), non-REM 3 (N3), non-REM 4 (N4) and REM (R) for four groups of subjects: Young/Normal, Old/Normal, Young/Sleep Disorder, Old/Sleep Disorder. The numbers in the cells give the transition probabilities in per mille rounded to integer values. Cells without a number correspond to transitions that never occurred in the dataset.

The normalization by the entropy Inline Formula of a uniform two-dimensional distribution renders H to lie in the range [0,1]. The normalized joint entropy H is computed for each subject and low values of H indicate less complex transition patterns.\nFigure 3a shows the distributions of H-values for the four classes of subjects whose average transition patterns are shown in figure 2. In table 2, p-values of a Wilcoxon rank-sum test (also known as Wilcoxon\u2013Mann\u2013Whitney test) performed for all pairs of distributions are given, indicating significant differences. These p-values have to be interpreted carefully, because of the relatively high number of individual tests that have been carried out which lead to accumulation of type-1 errors. Nevertheless, the differences between cases with and without sleep disorders in the young and old age groups as well as the difference between the Young and Normal versus Old and Sleep Disorder groups can be detected at a high significance level.\n\nFigure 3.\nFigure 3.

The lower entropy values for subjects with sleep disorder (figure 3b) indicate lower complexity due to missing sleep transitions involving deep sleep.\n\n(b) Spectral entropy measures\nKirsch et al. [11] proposed two spectral entropy measures specially suited for application to categorical time series: the WSE and the HSE. These spectral entropy measures can be interpreted as a quantification of the joint frequency distributions of all symbols contained in the original dataset. The names of the entropies are derived from the underlying Walsh- and Haar transformations, respectively. These quantities are computed as follows (the procedure is explained more in detail in [11]).\n\nThe original time series consisting of symbols st\u2208S,t\u2208[1,n],S={c1,\u2026,cm} is in the first step transformed into m binary time series Inline Formula\n\nDisplay Formula\n3.2\nIn the second step, either the Walsh transform or the Haar transform is applied to moving temporal windows Inline Formula, t\u2208[w,w+l\u22121] of the binary time series. Both transforms make use of a corresponding matrix Inline Formula: the Hadamard matrix in the case of the Walsh transform or the Haar matrix in the case of the Haar transform, each of size l\u00d7l, l=2N (see appendix for definitions of the matrices)\n\nDisplay Formula\n3.3\nThe elements Inline Formula of the l\u00d7m matrix Inline Formula are called Walsh/Haar transform coefficients and they are used to compute the corresponding l\u00d7m periodogram matrix of the temporal window [w,w+l\u22121]\n\nDisplay Formula\n3.4\nThis matrix Pw is then used to define a two-dimensional (normalized) entropy\n\nDisplay Formula\n3.5\nwith Inline Formula being a normalized version of Pw\nDisplay Formula\n3.6\nIn [11], these entropies are called 2D-WSE and 2D-HSE depending on the applied transform. In the following, we will refer to these quantities simply as WSE and HSE, as only the two-dimensional versions are employed here.\n\nBoth quantities are calculated for matrices of size l\u00d7l, l=26 for every successive overlapping window [w,w+l\u22121] of each dataset. This leads to an entropy distribution for each dataset. In order to be able to compare the entropies between groups, we use the mean value of the distribution of each dataset. These mean values lead to the entropy distributions shown in figures 4 and 5. Each pair of distributions in figures 4a and 5a is compared using Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. These results are given in tables 3 and 4.\n\nTable 3.\np-Values of a Wilcoxon rank-sum test performed for all pairs of WSE distributions shown in figure 4a.\n\nView inlineView popup\nTable 4.\np-Values of a Wilcoxon rank-sum test performed for all pairs of HSE distributions shown in figure 5a.\n\nView inlineView popup\nFigure 4.\nFigure 4.

Distributions of HSE for (a) four groups of subjects (compare transition matrices in figure 2), (b) subjects with and without sleep disorder and (c) old and young subjects. (Online version in colour.)\n\nDownload figureOpen in new tabDownload PowerPoint\nThe results for the WSE and the HSE are very similar, the distributions show a nearly identical shape. Tables 3 and 4 confirm what already can be seen in figures 4 and 5. The age effect on the spectral entropies can be differentiated at a high significance level. However, a differentiation does not seem possible for the sleep disorder effect, as the p-values clearly exceed the significance threshold for the comparisons Young and Normal versus Young and Sleep Disorder and Old and Normal versus Old and Sleep Disorder.\n\n(c) Transition graphs\nIn this section, the difference of transition probability matrices of different groups of subjects is used to analyse the impact of age and sleep disorder on one-step transition probabilities. These differences are visualized using pruned graphical representations where links between the sleep stages are plotted only if the distributions underlying the mean values of the particular transition in both groups are significantly different (p<0.01). Links can also be missing if the probabilities involved are too small. Note that the interpretability of p-values in this context must not be overestimated, as they are used here solely to choose relevant links for pruning the graph.\n\nFirst, we consider changes of transition probabilities due to ageing. Figure 6 shows a comparison of transition patterns of normal old and young subjects. The matrices show the transition probabilities for each group (given as numbers in per mille, compare with figure 2). The graph shows all significant differences of both transition patterns. The links are annotated with the difference values of the corresponding transition probabilities from both matrices. Here, a transition is considered to be significantly different if the p-value obtained when comparing the distributions of the transition probability values from both groups is smaller than 0.01. With ageing we see an increase of transitions between light sleep stages N1 and N2 and between N1 and W. On the other hand, for elderly subjects fewer transitions occur between deep-sleep stages N3 and N4, and between N2 and R. There is no significant difference of transitions N2\u2013N3 between young and old subjects. Elderly subjects wake up more often and exhibit fewer transitions to deep-sleep stage N4 and to REM sleep stage R.\n\nFigure 6.\nFigure 6. Difference of sleep-stage transition probabilities of normal old and young subjects displayed as a transition graph obtained from both transition matrices. The numbers at the links in the transition graph equal the difference of the transition probabilities (in per mille). Only significant links (p<0.01) are plotted in the graph. (Online version in colour.)\n\nDownload figureOpen in new tabDownload PowerPoint\nTo investigate the impact of sleep disorders on the transition probabilities, figure 7 shows a comparison of young subjects with and without sleep disorders. Similar to elderly subjects (figure 6), patients suffering from sleep disorders exhibit a higher probability of transitions within light sleep N1\u2013N2, less transitions within slow wave sleep N3\u2013N4 and no significant change in N2\u2013N3 transitions. Also transitions from N2 to REM sleep are reduced. This can be an expression of reduced slow wave sleep and reduced REM sleep as well in elderly subjects. As a difference we see no significant increase in transitions N1\u2013W. This reflects that young subjects with sleep disorders do not wake up more often compared with normal subjects without any sleep disorder.\n\nFigure 7.\nFigure 7.

Two-step transitions\nTo learn more about sleep-stage transition patterns, we consider now multistep transitions consisting of K steps starting with K=2. Figure 8 shows ranked probabilities of two-step transitions (the largest 25 values, only). The grey vertical bars give the 25 largest transition probabilities of two-step transitions averaged over all subjects under study. Most probable are transitions N2 Inline Formula N1 Inline Formula N2 and N2 Inline Formula N1 Inline Formula N2 corresponding to light sleep. These transitions occur more often in patients suffering from sleep disorder as can be seen from the dashed lines indicating transition probabilities of both groups Young/Sleep Disorder and Old/Sleep Disorder, respectively. The transition probabilities of Old/Normal subjects equal the total mean, while Young/Normal exhibit a relatively low probability of such light sleep transitions.\n\nFigure 8.\nFigure 8. Probabilities of the 25 most probable two-step transitions. Vertical grey bars give averages over all subjects, and (coloured) lines results for different groups of subjects. Dashed boxes indicate transition patterns exhibiting differences between the four groups of subjects.

Here transitions N1 Inline Formula W Inline Formula N1 and W Inline Formula N1 Inline Formula W are most probable for old subjects with sleep disorder, followed by the Old/Normal and the Young/Sleep Disorder group. The lowest probability of this transition scenario occurs with young healthy subjects. Transition patterns N4 Inline Formula N3 Inline Formula N4 of deep-sleep transitions or N1 Inline Formula N2 Inline Formula R including REM sleep occur with relatively high probability with young normal subjects and with reduced probability in the groups Old/Sleep Disorder.\n\n5. Markov order tests\nFigure 8 clearly indicates that an investigation of multiple transitions instead of single transitions can reveal subtle information about the sleep process. This raises the question which number of transition can be considered as appropriate for further analysis of symbolic dynamics. We are going to investigate this question in the framework of Markov chains.\n\nA Markov chain is a model assuming probabilistic transitions between states with a dependency on a specific number of temporarily previous states. A Markov chain of order k is defined as a probabilistic process where the current transition probability depends on the past k states. A symbolic chain involving n states can therefore be interpreted as a Markov chain of order k=n\u22121.\n\nPethel & Hahs [19] developed an exact significance test for determining the order of such a Markov process. This test makes use of the observed data in order to generate surrogates that match the properties of the data under the assumption of a Markov chain with a specific order k. This surrogate generation procedure is done using Whittle's formula [20]. Using an exact hypothesis test a p-value is calculated, which leads in the case of a small p-value to the rejection of the respective null hypothesis. The null hypothesis states that our process is indeed a Markov process of order k. To determine the order of the Markov chain the authors propose to run the test for ascending k starting with k=0 and choose the first k for which the p-value is larger than a significance threshold pth [21].\n\nWe applied this Markov order test to each dataset individually using the algorithm published in [22]. We chose Inline Formula as the maximum Markov order and used 1000 surrogates for each test. The method was applied to time series containing only the sleep-stage transitions, the durations were taken out. Figure 9 shows the resulting p-value distributions for four different group comparisons. As mean values of p-values can be misleading we show the fraction of all cases with a p-value larger than the significance threshold pth=0.05.\n\nFigure 9.\nFigure 9. Results of the Markov order tests run on each individual dataset (each night is included in the analysis separately). The ordinate displays the fraction of non-significant cases (pth=0.05). Four different group comparisons have been performed. (a) Splitting into four groups according to age (median-split) and sleep disorder (healthy or sleep disorder). (b) Comparison of the two nights of the experiment. (c) Display of the four age-quartiles which had already been analysed in figure 1. (d) Detailed comparison of the different sleep disorders as well as the healthy group. N is the respective number of datasets in the corresponding group. (Online version in colour.)\n\nDownload figureOpen in new tabDownload PowerPoint\nThe distributions show a very similar pattern for all group comparisons exhibiting a very strong increase in the fraction of non-significant cases for Markov order k=2. On the other hand, the null hypothesis assuming a first-order Markov process has to be rejected in more than 80% of the cases. No clear difference between all groups is visible in the group comparisons. Especially, the comparison of individual nights shows an almost identical shape of the curve.\n\nThese results indicate very clearly that the time series of transitions of sleep stages seems to follow a second-order Markov process.\n\n6. Conclusion\nTypical patterns of sleep-stage transitions of 196 healthy subjects and 98 patients suffering from different sleep disorders have been identified and quantified in terms of transition probabilities. We compared four groups: Young/Normal, Young/Sleep Disorder, Old/Normal and Old/Sleep Disorder. For each subject, the structure of one-step sleep-stage transitions is characterized by the resulting transition matrices representing the corresponding transition probabilities. To characterize these transition matrices, we computed their (normalized) joint entropy. Entropy distributions of the four classes of subjects studied here showed slightly different patterns (figure 3), which might allow for a distinction of healthy subjects and subjects with sleep disorder. By contrast, the spectral entropy distributions (WSE and HSE) which have been presented in figures 4 and 5 indicate a relatively clear distinction between young and old subjects. Furthermore, one-step transitions are visualized and analysed using (pruned) transition graphs (figures 6 and 7). This new presentation provided evidence that changes in transitions are slightly different with the ageing process and with the presence of sleep disorders. In particular, with ageing more transitions to and from the wake stage (W) occur. We conjecture that more specific details and differences between ageing and sleep disorder may be found when studying multistep transitions. Investigations of two-step transition patterns (figure 8) clearly indicate valuable information contained in the corresponding symbolic sequence of multistep sleep transitions. Markov order tests have been carried out (figure 9) and reveal that a Markov order of 2 is suitable for sleep-stage transition analysis. This result is stable across all group comparisons performed in this publication.\n\nIn this study, we also analysed transitions between N3 and N4 because we used scorings from a large study which used Rechtschaffen & Kales [2] scorings. We observe a considerable number of transitions between stages N3 and N4 and in this, we also observe differences between normal subjects and patients with sleep disorders. However, these differences between normal subjects and patients with sleep disorders may be just fluctuations within slow wave sleep and have no further clinical impact. All sleep staging had been performed by three scorers and, therefore, we expect that the fluctuations are not the effect of scoring variability but due to physiology with more and less high amplitude delta waves.\n\nWith the low number of patients with sleep disorders (n=98) and with the high number of diverse sleep disorders in this set of studies the presented results are to be considered as preliminary providing only weak evidence for differences. Clinically, well-defined datasets with specific sleep disorders should be used with this analysis in order to show whether the proposed and applied methods allow to distinguish the specific characteristics for pathological sleep-stage transitions for sleep apnoea, periodic limb movement disorders, narcolepsy and also physiological normal ageing.\n\nFunding statement\nThe authors thank the European Union DG XII for funding the Siesta Project (Biomed-2 BMH4-CT97-2040-SIESTA) through which the database was provided.

Keep reading to find out more\nand discover what can cause them.\n\nThere's something special about a cat with blue eyes. Dazzling baby blues are\na fairly unusual feature in the feline world and it's easy to see why so many\npeople are drawn to them. Blue eyes in cats are generally caused by a lack of\npigment, and all kittens are born with blue eyes because cats don't develop\neye pigmentation until they're around six weeks old, when the production of\nmelanin kicks in.\n\nSome cat breeds with blue eyes (especially pointed breeds) have a recessive\nalbinism gene, which means that they'll always have bright blue eyes. Whereas\nother breeds have an extra gene which also blocks the coat colour, so these\ncats will not only have blue eyes but they'll also be white in colour. Here at\nPurina, we've created a list of cat breeds with blue eyes for all you blue\neyed admirers.\n\n##  Balinese\n\nThis blue eyed cat breed is a longhaired variety of the Siamese. The  Balinese\nhas a silky, flowing coat and gorgeously deep blue eyes. The breed's long and\nelegant body makes the cat incredibly graceful, and it's thanks to this\nelegance that they're named after the exotic dancers of Bali.\n\nThe Balinese are known to be an affectionate breed and are extremely friendly\ntoward their owners. They are willing to shower anyone who gives them\nattention in lots of love.\n\n##  Birman\n\nThe  Birman  is a cat breed with blue eyes that's hard to resist. Their glossy\nblue eyes gives them a sweet appearance which will have you bending over\nbackwards for them. Their common characteristics are gentle, affectionate and\nplayful, making them ideal as family pets.\n\nPrevious  Next\n\n  1. 1  of  1 \n\nKnown as the Sacred Cat of Burma, there's even a legend surrounding this blue\neyed cat breed. It was said that they were given their luxurious coat and\nstunningly blue eyes as a reward from a goddess due to their dedication and\nloyalty to a priest.\n\n##  Himalayan\n\nOriginally known as a Siamese Persian cross, this breed was first produced in\nthe 1930's due to a desire to create a Persian cat with the pointed coat of a\nSiamese. Himalayan cats' eyes are always a vivid blue and their stature and\nshape is similar in appearance to the Persian, but they have different coat\npatterns.\n\nConsidered a medium-sized cat, their heavy bones and fluffy coat make them\nappear rather large in appearance. But don't be fooled, as most of it is\nfluff!\n\n##  Javanese\n\nThe Javanese is a blue eyed cat breed that was developed from Siamese,\nColorpoint and Balinese breeds. They appear elegant and delicate but they\nactually have a hard and incredibly muscular body, making them acrobatic and\nhighly skilled at jumping and climbing.\n\nDue to their high intelligence levels, Javanese cats are a breed that's well\nsuited to being trained and learning tricks. They're also well known for their\ncommunication skills, so they'll definitely tell you if they're unhappy or if\nthey want your undivided attention.\n\n##  Ragdoll\n\nRagdolls  are known far and wide for their glittering sapphire-like eyes and\nare considered to be one of the most affectionate cats. They make ideal lap\ncats and are at their happiest when they're with their people, following you\naround the house or encouraging you to make a fuss over them.\n\nThe Ragdoll got its name thanks to their tendency to go limp when picked up\nand the fact that they usually enjoy being carried around, unlike most other\ncats. This breed is extremely easy going and it's rare that you'll get one\nwith a bad temperament, making them one of the most popular breeds among\nfamilies.\n\n##  Siamese\n\nThe  Siamese  is a blue-eyed cat breed that is extremely popular thanks to\ntheir stunning appearance. They make amazing companions as they thrive on\nspending time with their humans, but they don't particularly like being left\nalone.\n\nThe Siamese is one of the oldest cat breeds in the world and were once\nconsidered sacred cats and used to guard Buddhist temples. Also, in ancient\ntimes these cats were royal and if one was stolen from the Royal Court it was\nan offence punishable by death.\n\n##  Snowshoe\n\nNamed because of their adorable white paws, the  Snowshoe  is a cat breed with\nblue eyes that is guaranteed to make your heart melt. Boasting big blue eyes\nand a masked face, this breed is most commonly beige, white or tan in colour.\n\nOriginating in the 1960s as a result of crossing a Siamese with various\nAmerican Shorthairs, the Snowshoe is relatively new in comparison to other cat\nbreeds. Generally, these cats tend to be quite vocal, though not as much as\nthe Siamese, and make loving, playful pets.\n\n##  Tonkinese\n\nThe  Tonkinese  is a result of crossing Siamese and Burmese cats, giving them\nall the best qualities of both blue-eyed breeds. They tend to be entertaining,\naffectionate and incredibly intelligent cats, and many owners say that\nTonkinese cats like to jump onto people's shoulders due to their love of\nheights!\n\nThese cats are normally indoor cats, and it's important to note that they\nshould not go outside without a lead as their trusting demeanour means that\nthey often lack certain defensive instincts.\n\n##  Turkish Angora\n\nAlthough one of the most common eye colours for this breed is blue, they can\nalso have green, gold and amber eyes, and they look adorable with them all!\n\nPrevious  Next\n\n  1. 1  of  1 \n\nThese cats are considered to be quite rare and are thought to be one of the\nfirst longhaired cats in Europe. One of the most noteworthy features of the\nTurkish Angora is their outgoing personalities, and are thought to act like\ndogs in some cases.\n\n##  Ojos Azules\n\nWhere this blue eyed cat breed is incredibly beautiful, it's also the rarest\nbreed on this list. Their name means 'blue eyes' in Spanish and there are only\na handful of these cats in the world. Which means that owning one is pretty\nout of the question.\n\nFirst appearing among feral cats in Mexico, there is very little known on the\nOjos Azules due to the rarity of it, but they look beautiful.\n\nFor more information on cat breeds, take a look at our  cat breed library  .\n\n##  Explore our cat brands:\n\nc_brand_discovery (cat)\n\nBrand (field_product_brand) (entityreference filter)\n\nDentalife\n\nCare for your pet's teeth daily with Dentalife's natural cleaning action.\n\ns\n\nDentalife\n\nDental Chews\n\n##  DENTALIFE\u00ae Dental Chicken Cat Treats\n\n4.8\n\n(2715)\n\nFrom\n\nCompare Prices\n\nDentalife\n\nDental Chews\n\n##  DENTALIFE\u00ae Dental Salmon Cat Treats\n\n4.6\n\n(43)\n\nFrom\n\nCompare Prices\n\nPrevious  Next\n\n##  Related articles\n\nCat Breed Guides\n\n5 min read\n\n##  Quiz: What Cat Breed Are You?\n\nCat Breed Guides\n\n5 min read\n\n##  The Most Affectionate and Friendliest Cat Breeds\n\nCat Breed Guides\n\n5 min read\n\n##  Incredible Rare Cat Breeds You Will Fall in Love With\n\nFinding A Cat\n\n17 min read\n\n##  Getting a Cat or Kitten\n\nNewsletter\n\n###  Sign up to our free pet-parenting newsletters!\n\nWe believe people and pets are 'Better Together'.

    "content": "Directed attention fatigue (DAF) is a neuro-psychological phenomenon that results from overuse of the brain's inhibitory attention mechanisms, which handle incoming distractions while maintaining focus on a specific task. The greatest threat to a given focus of attention is competition from other stimuli that can cause a shift in focus. This is because one maintains focus on a particular thought by inhibiting all potential distractions and not by strengthening that central mental activity. Directed attention fatigue occurs when a particular part of the brain's global inhibitory system is overworked due to the suppression of increasing numbers of stimuli.  This temporary condition is not a clinical illness or a personality disorder. It is rather a temporary fatigue of the inhibitory mechanisms in the brain. According to inhibition theory, it is natural for one to alternate between periods of attention and distraction. Although one's efforts may involve very different tasks, each incoming stimulus calls upon the same directed attention mechanism.\n\nSymptoms and signs[edit]\nExtreme levels of mental fatigue lead to an inability to perform regular tasks and irritability. Studies that require participants to carry out attention-demanding tasks under conditions of high distraction reveal how unpleasant a mentally fatigued person can be. After exposure to such an experience, individuals are less likely to help someone in need. They are also more aggressive, less tolerant, and less sensitive to socially important cues. Fatigue that is experienced by participants of these kinds of studies is induced by attention-intensive tasks, and the observed effects of such fatigue are correlated with decline in inhibitory control. Signs of Directed Attention Fatigue include temporarily feeling unusually distractible, impatient, forgetful, or cranky when there is no associated illness. In more severe forms, it can lead to bad judgment, apathy, or accidents, and can contribute to increased stress levels.\nThere are 6 major areas of mental processing that are affected during onset of DAF, which are as follows:\nInput \u2014 One may experience misperception and miss social cues.\nThinking \u2014 One may experience feelings of restlessness, confusion, forgetfulness and/or decreased metacognition.\nBehavior \u2014 One may experience feelings of impulsiveness and recklessness, and may find that they have a diminished level of threshold between thoughts and actions. One may also act out-of-character.\nExecutive Functioning \u2014 One may experience an inability to plan and make appropriate decisions and may experience impaired judgment ability.\nEmotions \u2014 One may experience being short-tempered and feelings of unpleasantness.\nSocial Interactions \u2014 One may experience heightened irritability and increased frequency of antisocial feelings.\nOverlap of symptoms from the six above categories is highly indicative of Directed Attention Fatigue.\nLink to ADHD[edit]\nThe symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder closely mirror the symptoms of Directed Attention Fatigue. Like Directed Attention Fatigue, ADHD involves the prefrontal cortex. Specifically, the right prefrontal cortex is less active among children with ADHD.  Experimentation has shown that the severity of ADHD symptoms can be correlated to the degree of asymmetry between blood flow in the left and right prefrontal cortex. It is possible that DAF and ADHD involve disruption of the same underlying mechanism, and recent clinical evidence has found that the same treatments used for Directed Attention Fatigue may reduce the symptoms of ADHD in children. However, it is important to note that unlike ADHD, DAF is a temporary condition rather than a clinical disorder.\n\nCause[edit]\nThis section does not cite any sources. Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (November 2012) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)\nThe onset of directed attention fatigue can be triggered by a number of activities, all of which involve use of the brain's inhibitory system. Activities that engage this system include multitasking, working in an environment with disruptive background noise or after a lack of sleep, and rapidly changing focus during a prolonged period of attention. DAF can also be brought about by performing concentration-intensive tasks such as puzzle-solving or learning unfamiliar ideas. External factors such as stress resulting from emergencies, exams or work deadlines can also induce DAF. Any illness or injury to the brain that interrupts the brain circuits involved in maintaining attention and inhibiting external stimuli may also contribute to the development of directed attention fatigue.\n\nAnatomy[edit]\nDirected attention, or voluntary attention, requires a great deal of concentration and focus, and is employed in tasks such as problem solving. This type of attention employs the inhibitory mechanisms of the brain, which help block incoming stimuli that are unrelated to the task at hand. Several parts of the brain are involved in maintaining directed attention, primarily those located in the frontal lobe and the parietal lobe of the brain. Specifically, the mechanism of directed attention employs the prefrontal cortex (PFC), the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the brain stem's basal ganglia. Some fMRI studies have shown that directed attention involves changes in the anterior cingulate cortex and the lateral prefrontal cortex, perhaps as a consequence of increased connectivity between these two areas. Evidence also suggests that the right inferior frontal cortex (IFC) plays a specialized role in response inhibition. It seems that this region plays a key role in the integration of bottom-up response-related information and facilitates goal-directed behavior.\nWhile these areas of the brain are known to be involved in DAF, their specific molecular mechanisms in the perpetuation of DAF symptoms are not yet known.\n\nDiagnosis[edit]\nDifferential diagnosis[edit]\nThe concept of stress is used in many situations that would be described as mental fatigue, but the two concepts are distinctly different. Stress involves preparation for an anticipated event that has been evaluated as being threatening or harmful. Though mental fatigue may well result from stressful circumstances, it also arises out of hard work on a project one enjoys. In such cases, there is no anticipation of threat or harm present but still the result is fatigue. Characteristic of mental fatigue is difficulty focusing. For a mentally fatigued person, paying attention to something uninteresting is burdensome, even though focusing on something of great interest poses no particular challenge. Hence, there are two types of attention, distinguished in terms of the effort involved in their use and their changes in attentional shift:\nInvoluntary attention refers to attention that requires no effort at all, as when something exciting or interesting happens.\nVoluntary attention, or directed attention, refers to attention that requires a great deal of effort, as when something is monotonous or boring.\n\nTreatment[edit]\nThere are measures that can be taken in order to reduce the impact of DAF. These include reducing the number of distractions present in one's external environment, trying to clear one's mind of any internal distractions and taking short breaks during prolonged periods of focus. Directed attention fatigue can be reduced by getting a sufficient amount of sleep each night, because inhibitory attention chemicals are replenished during sleep.\nAn aesthetic environment may also serve a restorative function in fostering recovery from mental fatigue. Research has shown that restorative experiences, such as clearing one's head and reflecting on one's life and priorities, may help combat Directed Attention Fatigue. As investigated by attention restoration theory, natural environments, such as forests, mountain landscapes or beaches, appear to be particularly effective for restoring attention, perhaps because they contain a vast amount of diverse, relatively weak stimuli, thus inciting the mind to wander freely while relaxing its strict focus.\n\nResearch[edit]\nOngoing research is examining ways in which the incidence of DAF can be decreased, and suggests that exposure to the natural environment may aid in the reduction of DAF symptoms. A number of researchers have investigated Directed Attention Fatigue recently. Leading contributors include Rachel and Stephen Kaplan, environmental psychologists at the University of Michigan. Rachel and Stephen Kaplan are credited with much of the research relating to Directed Attention Fatigue and were the first to discover that extended periods of focused attention can lead to DAF. Their research suggests that Directed Attention Fatigue can be alleviated with exposure to nature. Together, the Kaplans devised the Attention restoration theory (ART), which states that a person is better able to maintain focused directed attention after spending time in the natural environment.\nA number of studies have been performed that specifically focus on Directed Attention Fatigue experienced by cancer patients. Such studies suggests that the DAF experienced by cancer patients following surgery improves significantly through outdoor restorative activities for 20 minutes per day.\nSimilarly, it has been discovered that even brief amounts of time spent on a busy metropolitan street can affect one's ability to maintain focus on a given task. Experimental findings suggest that spending time in a natural environment or even looking at pictures of nature can improve maintenance of directed attention.\nThe Landscape and Human Health Laboratory (LHHL) has completed studies examining the complex relationship between people and their environment. Researchers here discovered the correlation between Directed Attention Fatigue, irritability and aggression. Their findings suggest that people deprived of the restorative effects of nature display more aggressive qualities. Results also demonstrate that communities with several trees and other natural areas tend to be stronger, safer and house residents with a higher attention level. More recent experimentation done at the LHHL suggests that children possessing attention deficits increase their attention level after walking outdoors.\nAccording to this and much other research that has been performed regarding directed attention fatigue, the brain's ability to maintain directed attention is heightened after exposure to nature.\n\nSee also[edit]\nAttention\nAttention span\nEnvironmental psychology\nEgo depletion\nHuman multitasking"

WWB has devised the **PUPAE\nNEST** , which is the most successful way of keeping pupae moist, safe and\nable to be examined whenever required. The **Pupae Nest** is suitable for all\npupae, but is particularly ideal for pupae that live on or under the ground.\nPupae are arranged in depressions in specially formed foam sheets, which keeps\nthe pupae separate, moist, and in hygienic conditions. Please see the **Pupae\nNest** in the section for Plastic Rearing Containers.\n\nFor the Field Naturalist there is the new **Spring Frame Pocket Net.** Please\nsee this in the **Equipment section of this website.** The design is\npractical, construction rugged, and the net fits nicely in the pocket, but can\nbe deployed in seconds when required. This keeps both hands free for\nexamination and photography, when the net is not in current use.\n\n**Osier Willow _S. viminalis._ ** Years ago we planted a stick that was\nfloating down a river in Wiltshire. That was in 1954! It grew - rapidly -\nproducing a wealth of leaves. We tried it as a foodplant and discovered that\nnot only did British species do well on it, but exotic silkmoth larvae as\nwell. An amazing foodplant that grows prodigeously, looks most attractive\ngrown formally in a garden, or in a wild setting.\n\n**Moonlander Moth Trap and Goodden GemLight.** No other trap is so compact and\nlightweight for travel. The only ultra compact trap and light for travel and\nsampling insects in remote habitats.\n\n**Rearing Cages** There are cages for travel, small ones for starters, Giant\nfor larger breeding programmes and the range of  **Pyjama Cages** in three\nsizes.  **Pyjama Cages** are practical in use and  one of the most important\nfeatures is that, a used cage can be renovated to almost new state in only a\nfew minutes. No need to replace netting that is worn or dirty, simply by\nremoving the entire netting cover and replacing with a new or freshly washed\none.\n\n**Sleeves.** Sleeving is the most natural method for rearing larvae, proving\nconstantly fresh food, with protection from parasites and predators, and\npreventing escape. The WWB sleeves uniquely have zip access which is a great\nconvenience and time-saver. Five sizes from small to giant.\n\n**This RECOMMENDED section is constantly evolving.

    "content": "\n\n09-18-2017 Largest and smallest animals at the highest risk of extinction By Eric Ralls Earth.com staff writer Researchers developed a global study to take a closer look at the sizes of endangered vertebrate animal species. An analysis of the body masses of thousands of animals revealed that the largest and smallest species of animals are at a higher risk of extinction than those in between. \u201cKnowing how animal body size correlates with the likelihood of a species being threatened provides us with a tool to assess extinction risk for the many species we know very little about,\u201d said lead author William Ripple of Oregon State University . The research team scrutinized over 27,000 vertebrate animals that had been assessed for the Red List of Threatened Species. Mammals , birds, reptiles, amphibians, bony fishes, and cartilaginous fishes were all evaluated for the study. Approximately 4,400 of the animals observed are threatened with extinction. \u201cMany of the larger species are being killed and consumed by humans, and about 90 percent of all threatened species larger than 2.2 pounds in size are being threatened by harvesting,\u201d said Ripple. \u201cHarvesting of these larger animals takes a variety of forms including regulated and unregulated fishing, hunting and trapping for meat consumption, the use of body parts as medicine and killing due to unintentional bycatch,\u201d explained the authors of the study. The researchers believe that the risks faced by the smallest species are greatly underestimated. The smallest species with high extinction risk consist of tiny vertebrate animals generally less than about 3 ounces in body weight. They are mostly threatened by loss or modification of habitat, and small species that require freshwater habitats are the most at risk. Some of the smaller species that are threatened include the Clarke\u2019s banana frog, sapphire-bellied hummingbird, gray gecko, hog-nosed bat and the waterfall climbing cave fish. The authors said that different conservation strategies will be needed to face the threats to the largest and smallest animals. While some large mammals such as whales, elephants, rhinos, and lions are well known and get more attention, conservation is also needed for large-bodied species that are not mammals such as large fish, birds, amphibians and reptiles.

    "content": "\nThe RGB color model (UK spelling: RGB colour model) is an additive color model in which the red, green and blue primary colors of light are added together in various ways to reproduce a broad array of colors. The name of the model comes from the initials of the three additive primary colors, red, green, and blue.\nThe main purpose of the RGB color model is for the sensing, representation, and display of images in electronic systems, such as televisions and computers, though it has also been used in conventional photography. Before the electronic age, the RGB color model already had a solid theory behind it, based in human perception of colors.\nRGB is a device-dependent color model: different devices detect or reproduce a given RGB value differently, since the color elements (such as phosphors or dyes) and their response to the individual red, green, and blue levels vary from manufacturer to manufacturer, or even in the same device over time. Thus an RGB value does not define the same color across devices without some kind of color management.\nTypical RGB input devices are color TV and video cameras, image scanners, and digital cameras. Typical RGB output devices are TV sets of various technologies (CRT, LCD, plasma, OLED, quantum dots, etc.), computer and mobile phone displays, video projectors, multicolor LED displays and large screens such as the Jumbotron. Color printers, on the other hand, are not RGB devices, but subtractive color devices typically using the CMYK color model.\n\nAdditive colors[edit]\nAdditive color mixing: projecting primary color lights on a white surface shows secondary colors where two overlap; the combination of all three primaries in equal intensities makes white.\nTo form a color with RGB, three light beams (one red, one green, and one blue) must be superimposed (for example by emission from a black screen or by reflection from a white screen). Each of the three beams is called a component of that color, and each of them can have an arbitrary intensity, from fully off to fully on, in the mixture.\nThe RGB color model is additive in the sense that if light beams of differing color (frequency) are superposed in space their light spectra adds up, wavelength for wavelength, to make up a resulting, total spectrum. This is essentially opposite to the subtractive color model, particularly the CMY color model, which applies to paints, inks, dyes and other substances whose color depends on reflecting certain components (frequencies) of the light under which we see them. In the additive model, if the resulting spectrum, e.g. of superposing three colors, is flat, white color is perceived by the human eye upon direct incidence on the retina. This is in stark contrast to the subtractive model, where the perceived resulting spectrum is what reflecting surfaces, such as dyed surfaces, emit. Simply put, a dye filters out all colors but its own; two blended dyes filter out all colors but the common color component between them, e.g. green as the common component between yellow and cyan, red as the common component between magenta and yellow, and blue-violet as the common component between magenta and cyan. It so happens that there is no color component among magenta, cyan and yellow, thus rendering a spectrum of zero intensity, black.\nZero intensity for each component gives the darkest color (no light, considered the black), and full intensity of each gives a white; the quality of this white depends on the nature of the primary light sources, but if they are properly balanced, the result is a neutral white matching the system's white point. When the intensities for all the components are the same, the result is a shade of gray, darker or lighter depending on the intensity. When the intensities are different, the result is a colorized hue, more or less saturated depending on the difference of the strongest and weakest of the intensities of the primary colors employed.\nWhen one of the components has the strongest intensity, the color is a hue near this primary color (red-ish, green-ish, or blue-ish), and when two components have the same strongest intensity, then the color is a hue of a secondary color (a shade of cyan, magenta or yellow). A secondary color is formed by the sum of two primary colors of equal intensity: cyan is green+blue, magenta is blue+red, and yellow is red+green.  Every secondary color is the complement of one primary color: cyan complements red, magenta complements green, and yellow complements blue. When all the primary colors are mixed in equal intensities, the result is white.\nThe RGB color model itself does not define what is meant by red, green, and blue colorimetrically, and so the results of mixing them are not specified as absolute, but relative to the primary colors. When the exact chromaticities of the red, green, and blue primaries are defined, the color model then becomes an absolute color space, such as sRGB or Adobe RGB; see RGB color space for more details.\n\nPhysical principles for the choice of red, green, and blue[edit]\nA set of primary colors, such as the sRGB primaries, define a color triangle; only colors within this triangle can be reproduced by mixing the primary colors.  Colors outside the color triangle are therefore shown here as gray.  The primaries and the D65 white point of sRGB are shown.  The background figure is the CIE xy chromaticity diagram.\nThe choice of primary colors is related to the physiology of the human eye; good primaries are stimuli that maximize the difference between the responses of the cone cells of the human retina to light of different wavelengths, and that thereby make a large color triangle.\nThe normal three kinds of light-sensitive photoreceptor cells in the human eye (cone cells) respond most to yellow (long wavelength or L), green (medium or M), and violet (short or S) light (peak wavelengths near 570\u00a0nm, 540\u00a0nm and 440\u00a0nm, respectively). The difference in the signals received from the three kinds allows the brain to differentiate a wide gamut of different colors, while being most sensitive (overall) to yellowish-green light and to differences between hues in the green-to-orange region.\nAs an example, suppose that light in the orange range of wavelengths (approximately 577\u00a0nm to 597\u00a0nm) enters the eye and strikes the retina. Light of these wavelengths would activate both the medium and long wavelength cones of the retina, but not equally\u2014the long-wavelength cells will respond more. The difference in the response can be detected by the brain, and this difference is the basis of our perception of orange. Thus, the orange appearance of an object results from light from the object entering our eye and stimulating the different cones simultaneously but to different degrees.\nUse of the three primary colors is not sufficient to reproduce all colors; only colors within the color triangle defined by the chromaticities of the primaries can be reproduced by additive mixing of non-negative amounts of those colors of light.\n\n\nHistory of RGB color model theory and usage[edit]\nThe RGB color model is based on the Young\u2013Helmholtz theory of trichromatic color vision, developed by Thomas Young and Hermann von Helmholtz in the early to mid-nineteenth century, and on James Clerk Maxwell's color triangle that elaborated that theory (c.\u20091860).\nEarly color photographsThe first permanent color photograph, taken by Thomas Sutton in 1861 using James Clerk Maxwell's proposed method of three filters, specifically red, green, and violet-blueA photograph of Mohammed Alim Khan (1880\u20131944), Emir of Bukhara, taken in 1911 by Sergey Prokudin-Gorsky using three exposures with blue, green, and red filters\nPhotography[edit]\nThe first experiments with RGB in early color photography were made in 1861 by Maxwell himself, and involved the process of combining three color-filtered separate takes. To reproduce the color photograph, three matching projections over a screen in a dark room were necessary.\nThe additive RGB model and variants such as orange\u2013green\u2013violet were also used in the Autochrome Lumi\u00e8re color plates and other screen-plate technologies such as the Joly color screen and the Paget process in the early twentieth century. Color photography by taking three separate plates was used by other pioneers, such as the Russian Sergey Prokudin-Gorsky in the period 1909 through 1915. Such methods lasted until about 1960 using the expensive and extremely complex tri-color carbro Autotype process.\nWhen employed, the reproduction of prints from three-plate photos was done by dyes or pigments using the complementary CMY model, by simply using the negative plates of the filtered takes: reverse red gives the cyan plate, and so on.\nTelevision[edit]\nBefore the development of practical electronic TV, there were patents on mechanically scanned color systems as early as 1889 in Russia. The color TV pioneer John Logie Baird demonstrated the world's first RGB color transmission in 1928, and also the world's first color broadcast in 1938, in London. In his experiments, scanning and display were done mechanically by spinning colorized wheels.\nThe Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) began an experimental RGB field-sequential color system in 1940. Images were scanned electrically, but the system still used a moving part: the transparent RGB color wheel rotating at above 1,200 rpm in synchronism with the vertical scan. The camera and the cathode-ray tube (CRT) were both monochromatic. Color was provided by color wheels in the camera and the receiver.\nMore recently, color wheels have been used in field-sequential projection TV receivers based on the Texas Instruments monochrome DLP imager.\nThe modern RGB shadow mask technology for color CRT displays was patented by Werner Flechsig in Germany in 1938.\nPersonal computers[edit]\nPersonal computers of the late 1970s and early 1980s, such as the Apple II and VIC-20, used composite video. The Commodore 64 and the Atari 8-bit family used S-Video derivatives. IBM introduced a 16-color scheme (four bits\u2014one bit each for red, green, blue, and intensity) with the Color Graphics Adapter (CGA) for its IBM PC in 1981, later improved with the Enhanced Graphics Adapter (EGA) in 1984. The first manufacturer of a truecolor graphics card for PCs (the TARGA) was Truevision in 1987, but it was not until the arrival of the Video Graphics Array (VGA) in 1987 that RGB became popular, mainly due to the analog signals in the connection between the adapter and the monitor which allowed a very wide range of RGB colors. Actually, it had to wait a few more years because the original VGA cards were palette-driven just like EGA, although with more freedom than VGA, but because the VGA connectors were analog, later variants of VGA (made by various manufacturers under the informal name Super VGA) eventually added true-color. In 1992, magazines heavily advertised true-color Super VGA hardware.\n\nRGB devices[edit]\nRGB and displays[edit]\nCutaway rendering of a color CRT: 1.\u00a0Electron guns 2.\u00a0Electron beams 3.\u00a0Focusing coils 4.\u00a0Deflection coils 5.\u00a0Anode connection 6.\u00a0Mask for separating beams for red, green, and blue part of displayed image 7.\u00a0Phosphor layer with red, green, and blue zones 8.\u00a0Close-up of the phosphor-coated inner side of the screen\nColor wheel with RGB pixels of the colors\nRGB phosphor dots in a CRT monitor\nRGB sub-pixels in an LCD TV (on the right: an orange and a blue color; on the left: a close-up)\nOne common application of the RGB color model is the display of colors on a cathode-ray tube (CRT), liquid-crystal display (LCD), plasma display, or organic light emitting diode (OLED) display such as a television, a computer's monitor, or a large scale screen. Each pixel on the screen is built by driving three small and very close but still separated RGB light sources. At common viewing distance, the separate sources are indistinguishable, which the eye interprets as a given solid color. All the pixels together arranged in the rectangular screen surface conforms the color image.\nDuring digital image processing each pixel can be represented in the computer memory or interface hardware (for example, a graphics card) as binary values for the red, green, and blue color components. When properly managed, these values are converted into intensities or voltages via gamma correction to correct the inherent nonlinearity of some devices, such that the intended intensities are reproduced on the display.\nThe Quattron released by Sharp uses RGB color and adds yellow as a sub-pixel, supposedly allowing an increase in the number of available colors.\nVideo electronics[edit]\n\nMain article: Component_video \u00a7\u00a0RGB_analog_component_video\nRGB is also the term referring to a type of component video signal used in the video electronics industry. It consists of three signals\u2014red, green, and blue\u2014carried on three separate cables/pins. RGB signal formats are often based on modified versions of the RS-170 and RS-343 standards for monochrome video. This type of video signal is widely used in Europe since it is the best quality signal that can be carried on the standard SCART connector. This signal is known as RGBS (4 BNC/RCA terminated cables exist as well), but it is directly compatible with RGBHV used for computer monitors (usually carried on 15-pin cables terminated with 15-pin D-sub or 5 BNC connectors), which carries separate horizontal and vertical sync signals.\nOutside Europe, RGB is not very popular as a video signal format; S-Video takes that spot in most non-European regions. However, almost all computer monitors around the world use RGB.\nVideo framebuffer[edit]\nA framebuffer is a digital device for computers which stores data in the so-called video memory (comprising an array of Video RAM or similar chips). This data goes either to three digital-to-analog converters (DACs) (for analog monitors), one per primary color or directly to digital monitors. Driven by software, the CPU (or other specialized chips) write the appropriate bytes into the video memory to define the image. Modern systems encode pixel color values by devoting eight bits to each of the R, G, and B components. RGB information can be either carried directly by the pixel bits themselves or provided by a separate color look-up table (CLUT) if indexed color graphic modes are used.\nA CLUT is a specialized RAM that stores R, G, and B values that define specific colors. Each color has its own address (index)\u2014consider it as a descriptive reference number that provides that specific color when the image needs it. The content of the CLUT is much like a palette of colors. Image data that uses indexed color specifies addresses within the CLUT to provide the required R, G, and B values for each specific pixel, one pixel at a time. Of course, before displaying, the CLUT has to be loaded with R, G, and B values that define the palette of colors required for each image to be rendered. Some video applications store such palettes in PAL files (Age of Empires game, for example, uses over half-a-dozen) and can combine CLUTs on screen.\nRGB24 and RGB32\nThis indirect scheme restricts the number of available colors in an image CLUT\u2014typically 256-cubed (8 bits in three color channels with values of 0\u2013255)\u2014although each color in the RGB24 CLUT table has only 8 bits representing 256 codes for each of the R, G, and B primaries, making 16,777,216 possible colors. However, the advantage is that an indexed-color image file can be significantly smaller than it would be with only 8 bits per pixel for each primary.\nModern storage, however, is far less costly, greatly reducing the need to minimize image file size. By using an appropriate combination of red, green, and blue intensities, many colors can be displayed. Current typical display adapters use up to 24-bits of information for each pixel: 8-bit per component multiplied by three components (see the Numeric representations section below (24bits = 256, each primary value of 8 bits with values of 0\u2013255). With this system, 16,777,216 (256 or 2) discrete combinations of R, G, and B values are allowed, providing millions of different (though not necessarily distinguishable) hue, saturation and lightness shades. Increased shading has been implemented in various ways, some formats such as .png and .tga files among others using a fourth greyscale color channel as a masking layer, often called RGB32.\nFor images with a modest range of brightnesses from the darkest to the lightest, eight bits per primary color provides good-quality images, but extreme images require more bits per primary color as well as the advanced display technology. For more information see High Dynamic Range (HDR) imaging.\nNonlinearity[edit]\n\nMain article: Gamma correction\nIn classic CRT devices, the brightness of a given point over the fluorescent screen due to the impact of accelerated electrons is not proportional to the voltages applied to the electron gun control grids, but to an expansive function of that voltage. The amount of this deviation is known as its gamma value (\n\n\n\n\u03b3\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\gamma }\n\n), the argument for a power law function, which closely describes this behavior. A linear response is given by a gamma value of 1.0, but actual CRT nonlinearities have a gamma value around 2.0 to 2.5.\nSimilarly, the intensity of the output on TV and computer display devices is not directly proportional to the R, G, and B applied electric signals (or file data values which drive them through digital-to-analog converters). On a typical standard 2.2-gamma CRT display, an input intensity RGB value of (0.5,\u00a00.5,\u00a00.5) only outputs about 22% of full brightness (1.0,\u00a01.0,\u00a01.0), instead of 50%. To obtain the correct response, a gamma correction is used in encoding the image data, and possibly further corrections as part of the color calibration process of the device. Gamma affects black-and-white TV as well as color. In standard color TV, broadcast signals are gamma corrected.\nRGB and cameras[edit]\nThe Bayer filter arrangement of color filters on the pixel array of a digital image sensor\nIn color television and video cameras manufactured before the 1990s, the incoming light was separated by prisms and filters into the three RGB primary colors feeding each color into a separate video camera tube (or pickup tube). These tubes are a type of cathode-ray tube, not to be confused with that of CRT displays.\nWith the arrival of commercially viable charge-coupled device (CCD) technology in the 1980s, first, the pickup tubes were replaced with this kind of sensor. Later, higher scale integration electronics was applied (mainly by Sony), simplifying and even removing the intermediate optics, thereby reducing the size of home video cameras and eventually leading to the development of full camcorders. Current webcams and mobile phones with cameras are the most miniaturized commercial forms of such technology.\nPhotographic digital cameras that use a CMOS or CCD image sensor often operate with some variation of the RGB model. In a Bayer filter arrangement, green is given twice as many detectors as red and blue (ratio 1:2:1) in order to achieve higher luminance resolution than chrominance resolution. The sensor has a grid of red, green, and blue detectors arranged so that the first row is RGRGRGRG, the next is GBGBGBGB, and that sequence is repeated in subsequent rows. For every channel, missing pixels are obtained by interpolation in the demosaicing process to build up the complete image. Also, other processes used to be applied in order to map the camera RGB measurements into a standard RGB color space as sRGB.\nRGB and scanners[edit]\nIn computing, an image scanner is a device that optically scans images (printed text, handwriting, or an object) and converts it to a digital image which is transferred to a computer. Among other formats, flat, drum and film scanners exist, and most of them support RGB color. They can be considered the successors of early telephotography input devices, which were able to send consecutive scan lines as analog amplitude modulation signals through standard telephonic lines to appropriate receivers; such systems were in use in press since the 1920s to the mid-1990s. Color telephotographs were sent as three separated RGB filtered images consecutively.\nCurrently available scanners typically use CCD or contact image sensor (CIS) as the image sensor, whereas older drum scanners use a photomultiplier tube as the image sensor. Early color film scanners used a halogen lamp and a three-color filter wheel, so three exposures were needed to scan a single color image. Due to heating problems, the worst of them being the potential destruction of the scanned film, this technology was later replaced by non-heating light sources such as color LEDs.\n\nNumeric representations[edit]\n#FFCCCC\n\n#FFC0C0\n\n#FF9999\n\n#FF8080\n\n#FF6666\n\n#FF4040\n\n#FF3333\n\n#FF0000\n\n\n#FFE5CC\n\n#FFE0C0\n\n#FFCC99\n\n#FFC080\n\n#FFB266\n\n#FFA040\n\n#FF9933\n\n#FF8000\n\n\n#FFFFCC\n\n#FFFFC0\n\n#FFFF99\n\n#FFFF80\n\n#FFFF66\n\n#FFFF40\n\n#FFFF33\n\n#FFFF00\n\n\n#FFFFE5\n\n#FFFFE0\n\n#FFFFCC\n\n#FFFFC0\n\n#FFFFB2\n\n#FFFFA0\n\n#FFFF99\n\n#FFFF80\n\n\n#E5FFCC\n\n#E0FFC0\n\n#CCFF99\n\n#C0FFA0\n\n#B2FF66\n\n#A0FF40\n\n#99FF33\n\n#80FF00\n\n\n#CCFFCC\n\n#C0FFC0\n\n#99FF99\n\n#80FF80\n\n#66FF66\n\n#40FF40\n\n#33FF33\n\n#00FF00\n\n\n#E5FFE5\n\n#E0FFE0\n\n#CCFFCC\n\n#C0FFC0\n\n#B2FFB2\n\n#A0FFA0\n\n#99FF99\n\n#80FF80\n\n\n#CCE5CC\n\n#C0E0C0\n\n#99CC99\n\n#80C080\n\n#66B266\n\n#40A040\n\n#339933\n\n#008000\n\n\n#CCFFE5\n\n#C0FFE0\n\n#99FFCC\n\n#80FFC0\n\n#66FFB2\n\n#40FFA0\n\n#33FF99\n\n#00FF80\n\n\n#CCFFFF\n\n#C0FFFF\n\n#99FFFF\n\n#80FFFF\n\n#66FFFF\n\n#40FFFF\n\n#33FFFF\n\n#00FFFF\n\n\n#E5FFFF\n\n#E0FFFF\n\n#CCFFFF\n\n#C0FFFF\n\n#B2FFFF\n\n#A0FFFF\n\n#99FFFF\n\n#80FFFF\n\n\n#CCE5E5\n\n#C0E0E0\n\n#99CCCC\n\n#80C0C0\n\n#66B2B2\n\n#40A0A0\n\n#339999\n\n#008080\n\n\n#CCE5FF\n\n#C0E0FF\n\n#99CCFF\n\n#80C0FF\n\n#66B2FF\n\n#40A0FF\n\n#3399FF\n\n#0080FF\n\n\n#CCCCFF\n\n#C0C0FF\n\n#9999FF\n\n#8080FF\n\n#6666FF\n\n#4040FF\n\n#3333FF\n\n#0000FF\n\n\n#CCCCE5\n\n#C0C0E0\n\n#9999CC\n\n#8080C0\n\n#6666B2\n\n#4040A0\n\n#333399\n\n#000080\n\n\n#E5E5FF\n\n#E0E0FF\n\n#CCCCFF\n\n#C0C0FF\n\n#B2B2FF\n\n#A0A0FF\n\n#9999FF\n\n#8080FF\n\n\n#E5CCFF\n\n#E0C0FF\n\n#CC99FF\n\n#C080FF\n\n#B266FF\n\n#A040FF\n\n#9933FF\n\n#8000FF\n\n\n#E5CCE5\n\n#E0C0E0\n\n#CC99CC\n\n#C080C0\n\n#B266B2\n\n#A040A0\n\n#993399\n\n#800080\n\n\n#FFCCFF\n\n#FFC0FF\n\n#FF99FF\n\n#FF80FF\n\n#FF66FF\n\n#FF40FF\n\n#FF33FF\n\n#FF00FF\n\n\n#FFE5FF\n\n#FFE0FF\n\n#FFCCFF\n\n#FFC0FF\n\n#FFB2FF\n\n#FFA0FF\n\n#FF99FF\n\n#FF80FF\n\n\n#FFCCE5\n\n#FFC0E0\n\n#FF99CC\n\n#FF80C0\n\n#FF66B2\n\n#FF40A0\n\n#FF3399\n\n#FF0080\n\n\n#FFE5E5\n\n#FFE0E0\n\n#FFCCCC\n\n#FFC0C0\n\n#FFB2B2\n\n#FFA0A0\n\n#FF9999\n\n#FF8080\n\n\n#E5CCCC\n\n#E0C0C0\n\n#CC9999\n\n#C08080\n\n#B26666\n\n#A04040\n\n#993333\n\n#800000\n\n\n#E5E5CC\n\n#E0E0C0\n\n#CCCC99\n\n#C0C080\n\n#B2B266\n\n#A0A040\n\n#999933\n\n#808000\n\n\n#E5E5E5\n\n#E0E0E0\n\n#CCCCCC\n\n#C0C0C0\n\n#B2B2B2\n\n#A0A0A0\n\n#999999\n\n#808080\n#FF0000\n\n#CC0000\n\n#C00000\n\n#990000\n\n#800000\n\n#660000\n\n#400000\n\n#330000\n\n\n#FF8000\n\n#CC6600\n\n#C06000\n\n#994C00\n\n#804000\n\n#663300\n\n#402000\n\n#331900\n\n\n#FFFF00\n\n#CCCC00\n\n#C0C000\n\n#999900\n\n#808000\n\n#666600\n\n#404000\n\n#333300\n\n\n#FFFF80\n\n#CCCC66\n\n#C0C060\n\n#99994C\n\n#808040\n\n#666633\n\n#404020\n\n#333319\n\n\n#80FF00\n\n#66CC00\n\n#60C000\n\n#4C9900\n\n#408000\n\n#336600\n\n#204000\n\n#193300\n\n\n#00FF00\n\n#00CC00\n\n#00C000\n\n#009900\n\n#008000\n\n#006600\n\n#004000\n\n#003300\n\n\n#80FF80\n\n#66CC66\n\n#60C060\n\n#4C994C\n\n#408040\n\n#336633\n\n#204020\n\n#193319\n\n\n#008000\n\n#006600\n\n#006000\n\n#004C00\n\n#004000\n\n#003300\n\n#002000\n\n#001900\n\n\n#00FF80\n\n#00CC66\n\n#00C060\n\n#00994C\n\n#008040\n\n#006633\n\n#004020\n\n#003319\n\n\n#00FFFF\n\n#00CCCC\n\n#00C0C0\n\n#009999\n\n#008080\n\n#006666\n\n#004040\n\n#003333\n\n\n#80FFFF\n\n#66CCCC\n\n#60C0C0\n\n#4C9999\n\n#408080\n\n#336666\n\n#204040\n\n#193333\n\n\n#008080\n\n#006666\n\n#006060\n\n#004C4C\n\n#004040\n\n#003333\n\n#002020\n\n#001919\n\n\n#0080FF\n\n#0066CC\n\n#0060C0\n\n#004C99\n\n#004080\n\n#003366\n\n#002040\n\n#001933\n\n\n#0000FF\n\n#0000CC\n\n#0000C0\n\n#000099\n\n#000080\n\n#000066\n\n#000040\n\n#000033\n\n\n#000080\n\n#000066\n\n#000060\n\n#00004C\n\n#000040\n\n#000033\n\n#000020\n\n#000019\n\n\n#8080FF\n\n#6666CC\n\n#6060C0\n\n#4C4C99\n\n#404080\n\n#333366\n\n#202040\n\n#191933\n\n\n#8000FF\n\n#6600CC\n\n#6000C0\n\n#4C0099\n\n#400080\n\n#330066\n\n#200040\n\n#190033\n\n\n#800080\n\n#660066\n\n#600060\n\n#4C004C\n\n#400040\n\n#330033\n\n#200020\n\n#190019\n\n\n#FF00FF\n\n#CC00CC\n\n#C000C0\n\n#990099\n\n#800080\n\n#660066\n\n#400040\n\n#330033\n\n\n#FF80FF\n\n#CC66CC\n\n#C060C0\n\n#994C99\n\n#804080\n\n#663366\n\n#402040\n\n#331933\n\n\n#FF0080\n\n#CC0066\n\n#C00060\n\n#99004C\n\n#800040\n\n#660033\n\n#400020\n\n#330019\n\n\n#FF8080\n\n#CC6666\n\n#C06060\n\n#994C4C\n\n#804040\n\n#663333\n\n#402020\n\n#331919\n\n\n#800000\n\n#660000\n\n#600000\n\n#4C0000\n\n#400000\n\n#330000\n\n#200000\n\n#190000\n\n\n#808000\n\n#666600\n\n#606000\n\n#4C4C00\n\n#404000\n\n#333300\n\n#202000\n\n#191900\n\n\n#808080\n\n#666666\n\n#606060\n\n#4C4C4C\n\n#404040\n\n#333333\n\n#202020\n\n#191919\nA typical RGB color selector in graphics software. Each slider ranges from 0 to 255.\nHexadecimal 8-bit RGB representations of the main 125 colors\nA color in the RGB color model is described by indicating how much of each of the red, green, and blue is included. The color is expressed as an RGB triplet (r,g,b), each component of which can vary from zero to a defined maximum value. If all the components are at zero the result is black; if all are at maximum, the result is the brightest representable white.\nThese ranges may be quantified in several different ways:\nFrom 0 to 1, with any fractional value in between.  This representation is used in theoretical analyses, and in systems that use floating point representations.\nEach color component value can also be written as a percentage, from 0% to 100%.\nIn computers, the component values are often stored as unsigned integer numbers in the range 0 to 255, the range that a single 8-bit byte can offer. These are often represented as either decimal or hexadecimal numbers.\nHigh-end digital image equipment are often able to deal with larger integer ranges for each primary color, such as 0..1023 (10 bits), 0..65535 (16 bits) or even larger, by extending the 24-bits (three 8-bit values) to 32-bit, 48-bit, or 64-bit units (more or less independent from the particular computer's word size).\nFor example, brightest saturated red is written in the different RGB notations as:\nNotation\n\nRGB triplet\n\n\nArithmetic\n\n(1.0, 0.0, 0.0)\n\n\nPercentage\n\n(100%, 0%, 0%)\n\n\nDigital 8-bit per channel\n\n(255, 0, 0) #FF0000 (hexadecimal)\n\n\nDigital 12-bit per channel\n\n(4095, 0, 0) #FFF000000\n\n\nDigital 16-bit per channel\n\n(65535, 0, 0) #FFFF00000000\n\n\nDigital 24-bit per channel\n\n(16777215, 0, 0) #FFFFFF000000000000\n\n\nDigital 32-bit per channel\n\n(4294967295, 0, 0) #FFFFFFFF0000000000000000\nIn many environments, the component values within the ranges are not managed as linear (that is, the numbers are nonlinearly related to the intensities that they represent), as in digital cameras and TV broadcasting and receiving due to gamma correction, for example. Linear and nonlinear transformations are often dealt with via digital image processing.  Representations with only 8 bits per component are considered sufficient if gamma correction is used.\nFollowing is the mathematical relationship between RGB space to HSI space (hue, saturation, and intensity: HSI color space):\nI\n\n\n\n=\n\n\n\nR\n+\nG\n+\nB\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nS\n\n\n\n=\n1\n\n\u2212\n\n\n\n3\n\n(\nR\n+\nG\n+\nB\n)\n\n\n\n\nmin\n(\nR\n,\nG\n,\nB\n)\n\n\n\n\nH\n\n\n\n=\n\ncos\n\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n\u2061\n\n(\n\n\n\n(\nR\n\u2212\nG\n)\n+\n(\nR\n\u2212\nB\n)\n\n\n2\n\n\n(\nR\n\u2212\nG\n\n)\n\n2\n\n\n+\n(\nR\n\u2212\nB\n)\n(\nG\n\u2212\nB\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\nassuming\u00a0\n\nG\n>\nB\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\begin{aligned}I&={\\frac {R+G+B}{3}}\\\\S&=1\\,-\\,{\\frac {3}{(R+G+B)}}\\,\\min(R,G,B)\\\\H&=\\cos ^{-1}\\left({\\frac {(R-G)+(R-B)}{2{\\sqrt {(R-G)^{2}+(R-B)(G-B)}}}}\\right)\\qquad {\\text{assuming  }}G>B\\end{aligned}}}\nIf \n\n\n\nB\n>\nG\n\n\n{\\displaystyle B>G}\n\n , then \n\n\n\nH\n=\n360\n\u2212\nH\n\n\n{\\displaystyle H=360-H}\n\n.\nColor depth[edit]\n\nMain article: Color depth\nThe RGB color model is one of the most common ways to encode color in computing, and several different digital representations are in use. The main characteristic of all of them is the quantization of the possible values per component (technically a sample ) by using only integer numbers within some range, usually from 0 to some power of two minus one (2\u00a0\u2212\u00a01) to fit them into some bit groupings. Encodings of 1, 2, 4, 5, 8 and 16 bits per color are commonly found; the total number of bits used for an RGB color is typically called the color depth.\n\nGeometric representation[edit]\n\nSee also: RGB color spaces\nThe RGB color model mapped to a cube. The horizontal x-axis as red values increasing to the left, y-axis as blue increasing to the lower right and the vertical z-axis as green increasing towards the top. The origin, black is the vertex hidden from view.\nSince colors are usually defined by three components, not only in the RGB model, but also in other color models such as CIELAB and Y'UV, among others, then a three-dimensional volume is described by treating the component values as ordinary Cartesian coordinates in a Euclidean space. For the RGB model, this is represented by a cube using non-negative values within a 0\u20131 range, assigning black to the origin at the vertex (0, 0, 0), and with increasing intensity values running along the three axes up to white at the vertex (1, 1, 1), diagonally opposite black.\nAn RGB triplet (r,g,b) represents the three-dimensional coordinate of the point of the given color within the cube or its faces or along its edges. This approach allows computations of the color similarity of two given RGB colors by simply calculating the distance between them: the shorter the distance, the higher the similarity. Out-of-gamut computations can also be performed this way.\n\nColors in web-page design[edit]\n\nMain article: Web colors\nInitially, the limited color depth of most video hardware led to a limited color palette of 216 RGB colors, defined by the Netscape Color Cube. The web-safe color palette consists of the 216 (6) combinations of red, green, and blue where each color can take one of six values (in hexadecimal): #00, #33, #66, #99, #CC or #FF (based on the 0 to 255 range for each value discussed above). These hexadecimal values = 0, 51, 102, 153, 204, 255 in decimal, which = 0%, 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, 100% in terms of intensity. This seems fine for splitting up 216 colors into a cube of dimension 6.  However, lacking gamma correction, the perceived intensity on a standard 2.5 gamma CRT / LCD is only: 0%, 2%, 10%, 28%, 57%, 100%. See the actual web safe color palette for a visual confirmation that the majority of the colors produced are very dark.\nWith the predominance of 24-bit displays, the use of the full 16.7\u00a0million colors of the HTML RGB color code no longer poses problems for most viewers.  The sRGB color space (a device-independent color space) for HTML was formally adopted as an Internet standard in HTML 3.2, though it had been in use for some time before that. All images and colors are interpreted as being sRGB (unless another color space is specified) and all modern displays can display this color space (with color management being built in into browsers or operating systems).\nThe syntax in CSS is:\nrgb(#,#,#)\nwhere # equals the proportion of red, green, and blue respectively. This syntax can be used after such selectors as \"background-color:\" or (for text) \"color:\".\nWide gamut color is possible in modern CSS, being supported by all major browsers since 2023.\nFor example, a color on the DCI-P3 color space can be indicated as\u00a0:\ncolor(display-p3 # # #)\nwhere # equals the proportion of red, green, and blue in 0.0 to 1.0 respectively.\n\nColor management[edit]\n\nMain article: Color management\nProper reproduction of colors, especially in professional environments, requires color management of all the devices involved in the production process, many of them using RGB. Color management results in several transparent conversions between device-independent (sRGB, XYZ, L*a*b*) and device-dependent color spaces (RGB and others, as CMYK for color printing) during a typical production cycle, in order to ensure color consistency throughout the process. Along with the creative processing, such interventions on digital images can damage the color accuracy and image detail, especially where the gamut is reduced. Professional digital devices and software tools allow for 48 bpp (bits per pixel) images to be manipulated (16 bits per channel), to minimize any such damage.\nICC profile compliant applications, such as Adobe Photoshop, use either the Lab color space or the CIE 1931 color space as a Profile Connection Space when translating between color spaces.\n\nRGB model and luminance\u2013chrominance formats relationship[edit]\nAll luminance\u2013chrominance formats used in the different TV and video standards such as YIQ for NTSC, YUV for PAL, YDBDR for SECAM, and YPBPR for component video use color difference signals, by which RGB color images can be encoded for broadcasting/recording and later decoded into RGB again to display them. These intermediate formats were needed for compatibility with pre-existent black-and-white TV formats. Also, those color difference signals need lower data bandwidth compared to full RGB signals.\nSimilarly, current high-efficiency digital color image data compression schemes such as JPEG and MPEG store RGB color internally in YCBCR format, a digital luminance\u2013chrominance format based on YPBPR. The use of YCBCR also allows computers to perform lossy subsampling with the chrominance channels (typically to 4:2:2 or 4:1:1 ratios), which reduces the resultant file size.\n\nSee also[edit]\nCMY color model\nCMYK color model\nColor theory\nColour banding\nComplementary colors\nDCI-P3 \u2013 a common RGB color space\nList of color palettes\nProPhoto RGB color space\nRG color models\nRGBA color model\nscRGB\nTSL color space"

Ever  since  we  first  slept  together,  he  only  lasts  in\nbetween  20-40  seconds  when  having  sex  (if  having  sex  for  the  first\ntime  that  day  and  at  a  normal  pace,  eg.  not  too  fast  but  not\nslow).  If  we've  already  had  sex  once  that  day  and  we  do  it  a\nsecond  time,  it  might  reach  a  maximum  of  2  minutes.  \n  \nHe  says  that  he's  been  like  this  his  whole  life  and  even  with\ngirls  before  me.  I  know  it's  common  for  boys  to  ejaculate  quickly\nwhen  they're  young,  but  he's  22  and  we've  been  together  for  3\nyears  so  he's  had  plenty  of  practice,  but  the  problem  is  not\nimproving  in  the  slightest.  He'll  last  longer  if  masturbating,  but\nagain  it  is  still  quick,  around  2  minutes.  It  has  got  to  the\npoint  where  we'll  have  sex  at  a  ridiculous  slow  pace,  or  he'll\njust  keep  stopping  during  it  to  try  and  last  longer;  it  makes\neverything  so  awkward.  \n  \nI  know  I  probably  sound  insensitive  and  that  there's  more  than  sex\nto  a  relationship,  but  this  has  been  going  on  for  so  long  and  I\nreally  feel  it's  beginning  to  take  a  toll  on  our  relationship\nbecause  it  frustrates  me  so,  so  much,  and  then  that  makes  me  feel\nbad  because  it's  not  his  fault.  I  told  him  the  other  day  that  it\nwas  affecting  me,  and  he  looked  so  upset  and  said  that  I  deserved\na  better  boyfriend,  which  made  me  feel  awful  for  even  saying\nanything  in  the  first  place.  I've  told  him  to  go  to  the  doctors\nand  that  I  would  accompany  him,  but  he  says  he's  too  embarrassed.  \n  \nI  know  that  he  can  do  'stuff'  to  me,  but  I  don't  enjoy  it  all\nthat  much  and  would  prefer  to  just  have  sex.  I  now  feel  as  though\nI  don't  even  want  to  have  sex  with  him,  because  it  just  feels\nlike  there's  no  point  to  it.  Even  though  it's  over  quickly  for\nhim,  he's  still  getting  some  pleasure  out  of  it  whereas  I  get\nabsolutely  nothing.  I  know  that  it  must  make  him  feel  really\ninadequate  which  is  why  I  have  tried  not  to  make  an  issue  out  of\nit  for  three  years,  but  it's  really  getting  me  down  now.  \n  \nDoes  anyone  have  any  advice  on  what  we  could  do  to  improve  the\nproblem,  or  any  tablets  we  can  buy?  Anything,  basically!\n\n1  Report\n\nScroll to see replies\n\n  * 1 \n  * 2 \n  * Next \n\nReply 1\n\n11 years ago\n\nunprinted\n\n19\n\nHe's  not  the  only  one  and  there  are  plenty  of  threads  about  this\nhere.  \n  \nWhat  he  needs  to  do  is  become  aware  of  when  he's  getting  close  to\ncoming  and  then  do  something  to  delay  it.\n\n0  Report\n\nReply 2\n\n11 years ago\n\nIdle\n\n2\n\nIf  you  don't  use  condoms  maybe  try  them,  if  you  do  then  thicker\nones  to  make  the  feeling  less  for  him.

So  keeping  your  PC  muscle\nloose  allows  you  to  have  a  more  forceful  ejactulation  when  you  do\norgasm  \n  \nNote  :  This  is  just  stuff  I  have  a  read  and  found  out\nexperimenting  with  myself,  I  have  no  formal  medical  or  sex  training.  \n  \nAlso  you  should  be  able  to  feel  your  PC  muscle.  When  you  go  for\nwee  put  your  finger  inbetween  your  anus/testis  and  push  the  pee  out\nhard,  you  should  feel  the  PC  muscle  drop,  then  cut  off  the  flow\nof  pee  and  the  PC  muscle  will  tense  up.  \n  \nIf  you  need  any  more  proof,  when  guys  pee  they  will  loosen  their\nPC  muscle,  howevever  when  it  comes  to  the  last  few  drops  they  try\nto  squeeze  out,  they  will  tense  up  their  PC  muscle.  The  motion  of\nthe  penis  when  doing  this  will  be  very  similar  to  when  a  guy\nejactulates,  notice  how  the  penis  seems  to  jump  up.  \n  \nAnyway  there  is  my  ramble  on  the  topic,  I  really  hope  this  helps.\n\n(edited 11 years ago)\n\n3  Report\n\nReply 6\n\n11 years ago\n\nAnonymous #2\n\nI  know  how  he  feels.  \n  \ni  had  this  problem  but  well  into  the  relationship.

Should  give  him\nan  extra  minute  or  two.\n\n2  Report\n\nReply 19\n\n11 years ago\n\nshirley7\n\n11\n\nOriginal post  by  Classical Liberal\n\nHas  he  tried  \"reverse  kegels\"?  \n  \nI  am  under  the  impression,  I  don't  actually  know  and  rarely  talk\nto  guys  about  things  like  this  (for  all  guy  bravado  with  regards\nto  sex  they  will  not  talk  about  it),  that  most  involuntary\nejactulation  is  caused  by  the  \"PC\"  muscle  (the  muscle  that  controls\npeeing,  pooing  and  ejactulation)  is  too  tense.  The  muscle  being\ntensed  up  stimulates  the  male  \"g  spot\"  (no  idea  where  this  actually\nis  but  I  can  definitely  feel  the  sensation  myself)  which  causes  a\nguy  to  ejactulate.  \n  \nYou  can  tense  up  the  PC  muscle  when  peeing.  Try  and  stop  the  flow\nof  pee.  You  can  relax  the  PC  muscle  by  doing  the  opposite.  By\ntrying  to  force  out  your  pee  as  hard  as  is  possible.  You  can  also\nloosen  up  the  PC  muscle  by  simulating  taking  a  poo.  \n  \nI  know  it  sounds  wierd  but  get  your  boyfriend  to  try  simulate\nhaving  a  ****/farting  during  sex/masturbating.  This  should  release  the\ntension  on  the  PC  muscle  (stretch  it  out)  and  reduce  the\nstimulation  that  leads  to  ejactulation.  Ideally  he  should  try  to\nsimulate  trying  to  take  a  ****  and  then  simulate  trying  to  pee\nhard,  however  the  latter  is  quite  tricky  without  any  urine.  He  will\nalso  probably  find  it  hard  to  breathe  doing  this  and  should  feel\nhis  abs  flexing.  Ideally  with  practice  he  should  be  able  to  learn\nhow  to  breathe  and  not  flex  his  abs.  \n  \nI  suspect  that  when  guys  start  feeling  that  sensation  of  just  being\nabout  to  ejactulate,  they  desperately  tense  up  the  PC  muscle  to  try\nand  block  the  semen  (just  like  trying  to  stop  the  flow  of  pee)\nhowever  this  just  makes  everything  worse  because  it  just  stimulates\nyou  even  more.  \n  \nAs  an  added  bonus  to  being  able  to  last  longer  by  stretching  out\n(removing  the  tension)  the  PC  muscle  he  will  also  be  able  to  have\nmore  forceful  orgasms.  Take  your  arm  and  imagine  you  do  not  have  a\ntricep  (only  a  bicep).  If  you  tense  up  your  bicep  your  arm  bends.\nWithout  your  tricep  the  only  way  to  straighten  out  your  arm  would\nbe  to  remove  the  tension  from  your  bicep.  Your  PC  muscle  works\nlike  this  (girls  have  them  too).  If  you  had  your  bicep  without  any\ntension  and  then  you  suddenly  tensed  it  as  much  as  possible,  your\narm  would  go  through  a  large  range  of  motion  with  a  lot  of  force.\nCompare  this  to  if  you  had  your  bicep  already  a  bit  tense  and\nthen  tensed  it  as  much  as  possible.  There  would  be  less  force  and\na  smaller  range  of  motion  compared  to  if  there  was  no  tension  in\nthis  bicep.  It  is  this  tensing  up  of  the  PC  muscle  that  forces\nout  the  semen.  And  the  larger  the  range  of  motion  of  the  PC\nmuscle  the  more  forceful  the  ejactulation.  So  keeping  your  PC  muscle\nloose  allows  you  to  have  a  more  forceful  ejactulation  when  you  do\norgasm  \n  \nNote  :  This  is  just  stuff  I  have  a  read  and  found  out\nexperimenting  with  myself,  I  have  no  formal  medical  or  sex  training.  \n  \nAlso  you  should  be  able  to  feel  your  PC  muscle.

    "content": "|  [Home]  [For Kids]  [Bugfood!]  [Mystery Bug]  [Insects All Year]  [Insect\nStories]  [Bug Fun!]  [Read More About Bugs]  [For Teachers and Parents]\nUniversity of Kentucky Department of Entomology\n\n* * *  \n  \n---|---  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n|  | \n\n##  The Secret Lives of Ants\n\n####  by Stephanie Bailey  \nEntomology Extension Specialist  \nrevised by Patricia Dillon\n\n* * *\n\n####  ACTIVITY #1 - Introduction\n\nEven though ants are tiny, as a group they have a big impact on the natural\nworld. All together, ants have the largest biomass of any group of animals on\nthe earth. Ants are champion earthmovers--they move more earth than any other\norganism including earthworms (who are no slouches in the dirt-moving\nbusiness, as you may know!).  Have kids draw or tell what they think is going\non underneath the soil in an ant nest. What jobs do they do? What do they do\nfor fun?  Then read a book such as  Ant Cities  , by A. Dorros,  Ants  by W.\nGoetsch, or  Insect Societies  by E. O. Wilson.\n\n####  ACTIVITY #2 - Ant Trails\n\nWatch the ants coming and going in an outdoor ant colony. Encourage the\nstudents to form ideas about their movement:\n\n  * Do they seem to follow each other? \n  * How do they know where to go? \n  * What advantage(s) would come from following another ant? \n\nForm hypotheses and test some of these ideas.  Here is an example of how to\nexplore ideas about how the ants know where to go.  Observation:  Many ants\nseem to be following the same path as the ant in front of them.  Question:\nHow do they know where to go?  Possible Answers:  They can see the ant in\nfront of them; they know the way from having gone there before; there is some\nkind of signal on the trail that they are following; etc. (Try to think of as\nmany ideas as possible here.)  Hypothesis (constructed from one or part of one\n\"possible answer\" from the previous step):  The ants are following some kind\nof signal on the trail. If this is true, we would expect that if we change the\ndirection of the trail, the ants will go in the new direction.  Test:\n\n  1. Place a small piece of paper over an existing ant trail. \n  2. let ants relearn the trail over the paper, and \n  3. then rotate the paper. What happens to the trail? What do the ants do? \n  4. Rotate the paper back. What do the ants do? \n\nConclusions:  What conclusions can you draw from these observations?  It turns\nout that when ants find food, they secrete an invisible chemical called \"trail\npheromone\" as they return to the next. This trail leads directly from the nest\nto the food source. Other worker ants then follow the trail right to the food.\nEach worker then reinforces the trail on the way back. When all the food is\ngone, the workers no longer secrete trail pheromone and eventually the trail\nfades away.  Younger students may enjoy pretending they are ants and making\ntheir own trails, using yarn, string, or pieces of paper to mark the trail for\nother \"ants\" to follow.  Student interest might lead to a more in-depth study\nof  pheromones  -chemicals which are used to help ants (and other insects)\ncommunicate. Besides pheromones for  trail and territory markings  , there are\n\n  * sex pheromones  which help males and females of the same species find each other over long distances, \n  * alarm pheromones  (aphids, social insects) which warn the colony or group of danger, \n  * primer pheromones  which influence caste development (who will be workers and who will be reproductives) and \n  * aggregation pheromones  (bark beetles, cockroaches) that cause insects to group together in a suitable habitat, although they do not form a colony. \n\nA good reference is  How Insects Communicate  by D. Patent.  Farmers and fruit\ngrowers use sex pheromones to monitor for pests that would attack their crops.\nThey place traps baited with a synthetic version of the sex pheromone for a\nparticular pest insect near their crops. When adult moths, attracted by the\nscent and coming in to mate, are trapped, then the farmer knows to be on the\nalert to protect the crop. A short article written by Dr. Rudy Scheibner of\nthe University of Kentucky contains more information on  using pheromones in\nagriculture  .  You might want to make or purchase a pheromone trap, and set\nit up (out of reach) outdoors, then see what you catch. A commercial Japanese\nbeetle trap, available from most lawn and garden shops, would illustrate the\npoint--it contains a combination flower (food) and sex pheromone lure that\nattracts Japanese beetles from great distances! Check with the local county\nextension office to be sure that it's placed outside when the insects are\nlikely to be active.\n\n####  ACTIVITY #3 - Seeing is Believing\n\nPurchase an ant farm from a toy store or, if an old frame is available, find\nan ant colony to start an ant farm. Ant colonies are very common. Look in\nrotting logs or near streams. Dig the colony up and place them in a plastic\nbag to transport them to the classroom. Place them in the container. Give the\nants several days to get settled. Feed them dead insects, peanut butter,\nyogurt and/or breadcrumbs.  Once the ants have become settled kids can start\nlisting the ants' activities (e. g. grave builders, food gatherers, tunnel\nmakers, egglayers, soldiers, nursery attendants, etc.), and divide these into\ncastes. Determine ratios or fractions of the colony doing each job. Research\nratios for human job categories at the library.  Insect Fact and Folklore  by\nW. Lucy has several interesting stories about special jobs that different ant\nspecies do.  Discussion/portfolio topic:  How are humans similar to and\ndifferent from ants (and/or other insects)?\n\n####  ACTIVITY #4 - Strength of Ants\n\nWhile watching ants coming and going from an outdoor ant nest, observe the\nsize of food that foraging ants bring back to the colony. How many times their\nsize can they carry? Discuss ways to determine a ratio of food size to ants,\ne. g. measure size (length) of particles versus ants or weigh them (although\nthey are so light, they will not register on most available balances, although\nit may be fun to try to weigh them just to show that point). Compare their\nstrength to that of a human being: we can pull about 60% of our weight, but\nants can pull 50 times their weight. Look up facts about human strength in\nThe Guinness Book of World Records  .\n\n####  ACTIVITY #5 - Ant Traps\n\nSee if you can attract ants with different types of baits, such as oil-based\n(e. g. peanut butter), sugar-based (maple syrup or jelly), or protein-based\n(chunk of meat). Place the bait in an inverted medicine bottle cap, or dab\nsome on a piece of masking tape. Do the ants prefer one type of bait over\nanother? Record how many ants visit each bait in a given amount of time. Do\ndifferent types of ants show up at different baits? What other insects are\nattracted to each bait?\n\n####  ACTIVITY #6 - Closure\n\nHow would life be different if we were the size of insects--what would\nparticular objects look like, what would we be scared of, who or what would we\nbe in control of, and what obstacles would we have? In what ways do our lives\nseem to be like those of ants? Show part of the movie  Honey I Shrunk the Kids\nvideo, continue discussion.  Discussion/portfolio topic:  Ants, unlike human\nbeings, are cold-blooded animals--i.e. their body temperature follows the\ntemperature of their surroundings. They do not maintain a constant body\ntemperature as we do. How do they keep warm in winter and cool in summer? What\nadvantages come from being cold-blooded? What disadvantages? What advantages\nand disadvantages are associated with being warm-blooded? Read the book  Where\nDo Insects Go In the Winter?  .\n\n* * *\n\n####  References\n\n     Dorros, A. 1988.

We spoke with experts\nand dug into the latest research to learn more.\n\n##  Does It Matter Whether You Take a Hot or Cold Shower After a Workout?\n\nThere\u2019s no direct proof indicating that hot or cold showers will make or break\nyour post-workout recovery, says  Corey Simon, PhD  , an associate professor\nin the department of orthopaedic surgery at Duke University, a senior fellow\nin the Duke Aging Center, and a physical therapist.\n\nIn many cases, the perks are anecdotal and mainly proliferate on social media\nrather than peer-reviewed journals. \u201cI see multiple posts per week on cold\nshowers and hot-to-cold contrast showers, touting therapeutic effects that\ninclude faster workout recovery, better skin, etc.,\u201d Simon says. However, he\u2019s\nyet to see these claims backed by scientific evidence.\n\nIn case you\u2019ve heard otherwise\u2014with sources claiming that research does, in\nfact, support the notion that shower temperature affects post-workout\nrecovery\u2014it\u2019s worth taking a closer look at the quality of the referenced\nstudies. They may be decades old or include small sample sizes, and they may\nnot be highly controlled or specific to exercise, Simon explains. \u201cThis means\nthat the findings may be a product of a number of factors aside from the\nintervention itself,\u201d he says.\n\n###  Related Articles\n\n####  Health\n\n4 Ways Infrared Saunas Can Give Your Mind and Body a Boost\n\n####  Stretching + Mobility\n\nCould a Cold Plunge Speed Up Your Workout Recovery?\n\n####  Stretching + Mobility\n\nStill Sore Days After Your Workout? Learn How to Relieve DOMS Pain\n\nFor instance, Simon often sees one  2016 study  cited in which participants\nwho took hot-to-cold contrast showers for 30, 60, or 90 seconds daily for 30\ndays noted fewer self-reported sick days at work compared to a control group.\nHowever, there are a few gaps in this study:\n\n  * Only the sick days from work were logged\u2014not actual days of illness. \n\n  * The sample groups weren\u2019t blinded, so a placebo effect could have played a role. \n\n  * Even if the benefits of hot-to-cold contrast showers were legitimate for staving off illness, the findings don\u2019t correspond to post-workout recovery. \n\nPlus, most of the research on hot or cold therapy as it relates to fitness\nfocuses on  cold water immersions  , cryotherapy,  saunas  , and other\nenvironments that don\u2019t mimic the exact conditions of a casual shower after\nexercising. While some of these recovery methods may have their merits, the\ncommon denominator of temperature doesn\u2019t mean that a hot or cold shower after\na workout will inevitably offer the same recovery perks.\n\nSo why  isn\u2019t  shower temperature all that powerful of a muscle recovery tool?\n\u201cThe tissue most affected by thermal interventions is the skin, and skin\ntemperature is poorly correlated with muscle temperature,\u201d Simon explains.\n\u201cAdd adipose tissue (fat) and the correlation is even worse.\u201d In other words,\nchanging the temperature of your skin with a hot or cold shower after a\nworkout won\u2019t necessarily translate to temperature changes in your\nmuscles\u2014meaning it probably won\u2019t have a big impact on post-exercise recovery.\n(Cold water immersion, on the other hand,  may reduce  delayed onset muscle\nsoreness, aka  DOMS  , by way of temporarily restricting blood flow, allowing\noxygenated blood to circulate after exposure.)\n\nAll that said, while your muscle recovery likely won\u2019t be impacted by a cold\nor hot shower after a workout, your post-exercise shower temperature  can\noffer other potential wellness benefits.\n\n##  The Benefits of Taking a Hot Shower After a Workout\n\nSome studies suggest exercise-related benefits of hot water immersion via\nbaths, from  increased blood flow  to  improved endurance  while training in\nthe heat. However, it\u2019s worth reiterating that this doesn\u2019t mean that hot\nshowers will yield the same results.\n\nTaking a hot shower after working out might not directly expedite recovery\u2014but\nit can potentially complement your exercise regimen and overall well-being.\nHere are a couple of potential benefits of the practice:\n\n###  Less Stress\n\nA hot shower won\u2019t only help you wash away your sweat and grime, but it can\nalso help lower your stress levels. \u201cThose who have taken a warm shower after\nstressful days or high-impact workouts can attest to its calming effects,\u201d\nSimon says. \u201cThe negative impact of stress on health is well established, as\nare the positive health benefits from its removal.\u201d\n\n###  Better Sleep\n\nGetting enough  high-quality shuteye  is crucial, day in and day out. Per a\n2019 entry  in  Sleep Medicine Reviews  , even a 10-minute hot shower, bath,\nor foot bath taken an hour or two before bedtime can improve sleep. Better\nsleep is only one component of post-workout recovery, but a crucial one\nnonetheless.\n\n##  The Benefits of Taking a Cold Shower After a Workout\n\nShowers aside, there\u2019s more evidence on the benefits of thermal interventions\nsuch as cold water immersion and  whole- or partial-body cryo-stimulation  ,\nparticularly for improving muscle soreness, Simon explains. Still, cold\nshowers may stand to benefit some people after exercise, though more robust\nevidence is needed.\n\nWith that in mind, here are a couple of possible benefits of taking a cold\nshower after a workout:\n\n###  Less Stress\n\nSimilar to hot showers, cold showers may also reduce stress levels\u2014so long as\nit\u2019s paired with breathwork. Per a  2022 randomized trial  published in the\njournal  Current Psychology  , participants who paired  pranayama-style\nbreathing exercises  with a 15- to 60-second cold shower daily over 14 days\nreported lower stress levels compared to a control group. \u201cHowever,\nparticipants performing breathing only, or cold shower only, also showed\nimproved stress levels; and the breathing-only group had larger effects than\nthe cold-shower-only group,\u201d Simon explains.\n\nIn short, a cold shower might help you feel less stressed out\u2014but  mindfulness\npractices  may be even more effective.\n\n###  Feel-Good Chemical Release\n\nBraving colder temps will test your limits and push you out of your comfort\nzone. Overcoming the discomfort can garner a sense of accomplishment,\npotentially eliciting a placebo effect that can make you feel powerful. Simon\nis careful to note that this placebo effect isn\u2019t \u201cnothing\u201d and can actually\nhave therapeutic effects: Even expecting an intervention to work can influence\nthe release of feel-good chemicals in your body, he says.\n\n##  How to Decide Between a Hot or Cold Shower After a Workout\n\nMore high-quality studies are needed to determine if taking a cold or hot\nshower (or switching between the two) after a workout can actually promote\nhealing and recovery. With that in mind, you can simply stick to whichever\nshower temperature you prefer most.\n\nFeeling adventurous? You can test the waters (literally) with cold showers to\nsee if a placebo effect takes hold, or try out more vetted types of cold\nexposure therapy such as cold plunging. \u201cAs mentioned, cold water immersion or\nbody cryo-stimulation show promise for reducing  muscle soreness  ,\u201d Simon\nreiterates. However, he adds that more high-quality research is needed to\ngauge safety and efficacy for people of different ages, health statuses,\nlevels of physical fitness, and the like. (At the same time, you\u2019ll want to\navoid going overboard, as excessive cold exposure may run counter to your\ngoals. For instance, \u201cthere is a growing sentiment among researchers that\nusing cold interventions for too long or too frequently can actually delay\nhealing,\u201d Simon says.)\n\nIf recovery is your main goal, experts recommend prioritizing other aspects of\nyour regimen besides your post-exercise shower temperature. \u201cMy advice would\nbe to worry about things such as following a proper training program, eating\nwell, and resting, rather than the temperature of your shower,\u201d says  Jasmine\nMarcus  , a physical therapist based in Ithaca, New York. To  alleviate sore\nmuscles after a workout  , you can also benefit from the likes of  cooldown\nexercises  ,  foam rolling  , and massage.  Staying hydrated  and\nincorporating  rest days  is crucial, too.\n\n##  The Takeaway\n\nWhether you prefer a hot or cold shower after a workout, the water temperature\nprobably won\u2019t impact your exercise recovery timeline much. While other\nthermal interventions such as cold plunging or cryotherapy have been shown to\nimprove muscle recovery, your shower temperature probably won\u2019t have a big\nimpact. That said, cold or hot showers after a workout may offer other\npotential wellness benefits, such as less stress or better Zzzs. But if muscle\nrecovery is your top priority, experts advise focusing on other recovery best\npractices, such as making time for rest, staying hydrated, fueling your body\nwith healthy foods, and following an appropriate training program.\n\nTry the Peloton App for Free\n\nThis content is for informational and educational purposes only and does not\nconstitute individualized advice.

Sleep inertia, or the grogginess felt upon awakening, is\nassociated with significant cognitive performance decrements that dissipate as\ntime awake increases. This impairment in cognitive performance has been\nobserved in both tightly controlled in-laboratory studies and in real-world\nscenarios. Further, these decrements in performance are exaggerated by prior\nsleep loss and the time of day in which a person awakens. This review will\nexamine current insights into the causes of sleep inertia, factors that may\npositively or negatively influence the degree of sleep inertia, the\nconsequences of sleep inertia both in the laboratory and in real-world\nsettings, and lastly discuss potential countermeasures to lessen the impact of\nsleep inertia.\n\n**Keywords:** cognitive performance, countermeasures, grogginess\n\n\n##  Introduction\n\n\u201c \u2026 immediately after getting up, irrespective of the hour, one is not at\none\u2019s best,\u201d Kleitman  1  observed, in perhaps the earliest known description\nof sleep inertia in the sleep literature. Sleep inertia is the term used to\nrefer to the temporary time of sleepiness, disorientation and impaired\ncognitive performance experienced upon awakening.  2  Early investigations  3\n\u2013  8  of the paradoxical phenomenon of \u201cwaking up tired\u201d, although somewhat\nlimited by low participant numbers and methodological design, have had their\nfindings of impaired performance upon awakening supported by a wealth of\nsubsequent, more rigorous studies. Understanding the underlying causes,\nconsequences, and countermeasures to sleep inertia is important for managing\nthis period of impaired performance for those working on-call or napping on-\nshift who are then required to perform safety-critical tasks soon after\nwaking. The aim of this review is to summarize decades of research that have\nled to current insights into the following areas of sleep inertia:\ncharacterization of neurophysiological correlates; contributing factors\ninfluencing severity; neurobehavioral and real-world consequences; and\nfinally, proactive and reactive countermeasures. The review will first define\nsleep inertia as part of the three-process model of sleep regulation  9  and\nthen address each of the topics listed above.\n\n##  Sleep inertia: the third process of sleep regulation\n\nThe propensity for sleep and sleepiness is governed by two main processes: a\nhomeostatic drive or pressure for sleep (Process S), and a circadian rhythm of\narousal (Process C).  10  ,  11  Process S promotes sleepiness as hours of\nwakefulness accumulate and is dissipated with time spent asleep. Process C is\ndriven by a circadian pacemaker, the suprachiasmatic nucleus, to promote sleep\nat night and alertness during the day.  12  Thus, the well-accepted two-\nprocess model of sleep regulation would theoretically predict higher alertness\nand performance following depletion of the homeostatic drive, which often\ncoincides with a rise in the circadian drive for alertness following habitual\nmorning awakenings. What is observed at this time, however, is a short, yet\nsalient, decrease in alertness and performance immediately after waking.  4  \u2013\n6  Therefore, a third-process (Process W; or Process I, in some descriptions)\n9  is necessary to better describe these fluctuations in sleepiness. In a\nthree-process model (  Figure 1  ), sleep inertia (green line) is immediately\npresent at sleep offset, briefly counteracting the low homeostatic drive for\nsleep (red line) and the rising circadian drive for wakefulness (blue line).\n\n[\n![](getfile_article_fulltext.php?filename=article_fulltext%2Fs188000%2F188911/img/NSS_A_188911_O_F0001g_Thumb.jpg)\n](getfile_article_fulltext.php?filename=article_fulltext%2Fs188000%2F188911/img/NSS_A_188911_O_F0001g.jpg)\n|\n\n**Figure 1** A schematic of the three-process model of sleep regulation.\n\n---|---\n\nThe exact function of sleep inertia remains largely unknown.  13  ** ,  ** 14\nFrom an evolutionary perspective, one might posit that the ability to rapidly\nawaken from sleep would be advantageous, for example when awakening in\nresponse to a potential threat.  13  ** ,  ** 14  A more gradual awakening,\nhowever, may also be protective given the complexity of neural circuitry in\ntransitioning from one state to another,  14  as is discussed in the\nneurophysiology section below. Sleep inertia may, therefore, be an adaptive\nmechanism to promote sleep upon awakening so that sleep is maintained when the\nawakening is undesired. For example, as with the timing of the circadian\nnadir,  15  sleep inertia may help to maintain sleep in the later part of a\nnocturnal sleep episode when homeostatic sleep pressure has largely\ndissipated. It is only when the restoration of wakefulness needs to be rapid\nthat the process of sleep inertia appears maladaptive. Vyazovskiy et al  14\nalso propose that the gradual awakening following rapid eye movement (REM)\nsleep may be a \u201creset\u201d function to minimize hypnopompic intrusions into\nwakefulness. These theories as to the function of sleep inertia require\nfurther research. Animal studies investigating the evolutionary progression of\nsleep inertia across species may be useful in addressing this gap in the\nliterature. Currently, neurophysiological studies have provided perhaps the\nbest insights into this area, as summarized in the next section.\n\n##  Neurophysiological basis of sleep inertia\n\nWhile the transition from sleep to wakefulness has received comparatively\nlittle attention relative to the transition from wakefulness to sleep, there\nis growing evidence for the underlying neurophysiological causes of sleep\ninertia. For example, spectral analyses of electroencephalography (EEG) after\nwaking have offered insight into the encephalographic substratum of sleep\ninertia. Compared to pre-sleep wakefulness, post-sleep EEG typically contains\nhigher delta power (associated with deep sleep) and lower beta power\n(associated with wakefulness).  16  \u2013  19  Reported changes in theta power\n(associated with drowsiness or REM sleep) have been less consistent.  16  ,\n17  ,  19  Regional differences in power have also been discovered, with a\ngreater increase in delta waves observed in the posterior regions, which may\nsuggest slower reactivation of these areas after waking.  16  \u2013  18  Further,\na recent study by Vallat et al  19  assessed the functional connectivity of\ndifferent brain regions post-awakening and observed that, compared to those\nwaking from lighter N2 sleep (non-REM stage 2 by Rechtschaffen & Kale\nscoring),  20  participants waking from deeper N3 sleep (non-REM Stage 3 and\n4) had higher connectivity between the default mode network and brain regions\nresponsible for sensory-motor control and attention. The authors posited that\nthis reduction of functional brain network segregation from the default mode\nnetwork, which is also observed during sleep and periods of elevated\nsleepiness,  21  may be responsible for the physical and cognitive effects\nobserved during sleep inertia.\n\nStudies of brain activity upon awakening have observed that cerebral blood\nflow velocity is lower than pre-sleep levels for up to half an hour after\nwaking, reflecting the typical dissipation of cognitive effects.  22  \u2013  24\nAdditional investigation of these changes discovered brain-region dependent\nchanges, with the prefrontal cortical regions (responsible for executive\nfunction) taking longer to return to baseline levels.  23  ,  25  Another\ntheory for the neurological basis of sleep inertia came from Van Dongen et\nal's observation that sleep inertia is suppressed by caffeine consumed just\nprior to the sleep opportunity.  26  Given caffeine acts as an adenosine\nreceptor antagonist, sleep inertia observed following awakenings in sleep\nrestriction scenarios may be partly due to left over adenosine stores that\nhave not been removed during sleep.\n\nWhile there are few animal studies investigating the transition from sleep to\nwake, Vyazovskiy et al  14  looked at neuronal activity in rodents following\nspontaneous arousals from sleep. Their study found lower neuronal activity\nafter waking at a population level, but that individual neurons varied, with a\nsubset of neurons being silent for 1 min after waking. Further, the authors\nobserved that neuronal silence was higher following REM sleep compared to\nwaking from non-REM sleep.\n\nThus, the neurobehavioral impairments observed after waking appear to be due\nto a delay in transitioning several independent neurophysiological processes\nand that this transitional lag is most evident in regions related to higher\norder processes necessary for cognitive tasks.  14  ,  16  \u2013  19  ,  21  \u2013  26\nThese transitions could be targeted in the development of novel interventions\nto enhance the transition from sleep to a fully alert state.\n\n##  Contributing factors: the influence of sleep and circadian rhythms on\nsleep inertia\n\nThere are several factors influencing the severity and duration of sleep\ninertia. However, as is discussed at the end of this section, sleep inertia\ncan still occur in the absence of these exacerbating factors.\n\n###  Waking after prior sleep loss\n\nSleep inertia is worse under conditions of prior sleep loss. In studies\ncomparing sleep inertia following an 8-h sleep opportunity to partial sleep\ndeprivation, performance upon waking was significantly worse after the partial\nsleep deprivation night.  27  ,  28  Extended wakefulness prior to a recovery\nsleep episode can also exacerbate the sleep inertia observed following\nrecovery sleep.  29  ,  30  In a between-subjects design, Dinges et al  30\nallocated a 2-h nap to participants after varying durations of prior\nwakefulness (6, 18, 30, 42 and 54 hrs). Reaction times slowed and the number\nof correct subtractions decreased as time awake prior to the nap increased. In\na within-subjects design, Rosa et al  29  also measured performance after a\n2-h nap opportunity following either 16 hrs of wakefulness, or up to 64 hrs of\nwakefulness, with worse performance observed after waking from the nap\nfollowing 64 hrs. Sleep inertia is also worsened by cumulative sleep loss.\nBalkin and Badia\u2019s  31  observation of increased sleep inertia effects across\nfour nights of disrupted sleep was recently supported by an in-laboratory\nstudy in which participants were studied under conditions of chronic sleep\nrestriction (equivalent to sleep opportunities of 5.6 hrs per 24-h day).\nNotably, compared to a control condition (equivalent to sleep opportunities of\n8 hrs per 24-h day), participants undergoing chronic sleep restriction\nexperienced a 10% worsening of performance immediately upon awakening, with\naverage levels of performance failing to reach baseline levels at 70 mins post\nawakening.  32  Together, these studies suggest that sleep loss, in the form\nof restricted sleep, extended wakefulness, or cumulative sleep loss,\ncontributes to increased sleep inertia effects.\n\n###  Waking during the night\n\nSleep inertia effects are greatest during the biological night, near the\ncircadian low in core body temperature.  30  ,  33  \u2013  35  Using a protocol\ndesigned to spread behaviors evenly across all hours of the 24-h day (ie,\nforced desynchrony protocol), Scheer et al  33  found that circadian rhythms\nsignificantly influenced the number of correct responses on an addition task\nperformed within two minutes of waking. In this study, amplitude in circadian\nvariation observed immediately after waking was greater than that observed at\nlater testing points. This finding suggests that circadian rhythms exert an\neffect on sleep inertia, independent to its effect on background performance.\nThis effect has also been observed in older participants (>55 y).  34\n\nWhile Scheer et al  33  independently assessed the effects of circadian\nrhythms and sleep pressure on sleep inertia, Dinges et al  30  investigated\nthe interaction between the two processes. In their study, participants took a\n2-h nap near the peak (approximately 15:00) or trough (approximately 03:00) of\nthe circadian cycle, following varying amounts of prior sleep loss (6\u201354 hrs\nof prior wakefulness). This study found that during the peak in alertness, the\neffect of prior sleep deprivation on sleep inertia appeared to be attenuated.\nMeanwhile, during the trough, these effects were exacerbated. This interaction\nbetween sleep loss, circadian timing, and performance during sleep inertia has\nalso been found under conditions of chronic sleep restriction.  32  The\nresults of these studies suggest that circadian rhythms have a direct effect\non sleep inertia, and also moderate the effects of sleep deprivation. This\ninteraction creates a non-linear trend in performance as sleep deprivation\nincreases.\n\nStudies designed to systematically assess the impact of circadian rhythms on\nsleep inertia show clear support for a time-of-day influence, with worse\nperformance immediately after waking during the circadian low. This effect has\nalso been demonstrated to be in addition to circadian effects on background\nperformance and to modulate the influence of homeostatic pressure.\n\n###  Waking from deep sleep\n\nMixed observations have been reported on whether the depth of sleep, or the\nstage of sleep, at awakening has a significant effect on sleep inertia. The\nincreased amount of, and greater propensity to wake from, slow wave sleep\n(SWS) under conditions of sleep pressure may be associated with the observed\nincrease in sleep inertia following sleep loss. Similarly, the observation\nthat sleep inertia is less likely to occur after short naps (\u226430 mins)  36  \u2013\n38  may be due to the typical delay in SWS onset of 30 mins.  39  This section\nexplores the evidence for and against the influence of SWS on sleep inertia.\n\nPerhaps the most frequently cited evidence for an effect of sleep depth on\nsleep inertia is Dinges et al's  30  study of 2-h naps during 54 hrs of sleep\ndeprivation. Their study measured reaction time by the speed with which\nparticipants answered a wake-up phone call and showed that increasing sleep\ndepth was associated with slower response speed. This was particularly evident\nfor awakenings from slow wave Stage 4 sleep (now classified as N3 under the\nAASM scoring guidelines).  40  Furthermore, the amount of SWS during the\npreceding nap was associated with worse performance on a descending\nsubtraction task performed immediately after answering the phone. Several\nother studies have also observed sleep stage at awakening as a key predictor\nof performance impairment upon waking. Stampi  41  reported that participants\nwaking from SWS showed a 41% reduction in performance upon awakening compared\nto performance pre-nap, whereas participants waking from Stage 2 (N2) sleep\nshowed similar performance to those who were already awake. Sleep depth as\nassessed by power spectral analysis showed that the amount of delta activity\n(a marker of SWS) in the 10 mins prior to waking from a restricted sleep\nepisode was negatively correlated with performance immediately after waking.\n27  Further, performance on a decision-making task was significantly worse\nupon waking from SWS compared to REM sleep.  42  Together, the results from\nthe above studies suggest a positive relationship between greater sleep depth\nand greater sleep inertia.\n\nMany more-recent studies have also found an association between sleep depth\nand sleep inertia. However, these studies were not necessarily designed to\nsystematically investigate this relationship and therefore rarely support\ntheir observations with statistical analysis.  36  ,  37  ,  43  In\nparticular, studies of afternoon naps showing that the amount of SWS and the\nseverity of sleep inertia increase with nap length have not confirmed the role\nof SWS with further analysis.  36  ,  37  Regardless of the mechanisms\nunderlying the relationship between greater nap length and greater sleep\ninertia, these observations lend support to the use of short naps in an effort\nto minimize sleep inertia.\n\nIn contrast, some studies have reported no association between sleep depth  33\n,  44  ,  45  or sleep stages at awakening  33  ,  45  ,  46  and post-sleep\nperformance. This lack of association has been demonstrated at all times of\nday under controlled prior sleep\u2013wake conditions.  33  and following extended\nwakefulness during the night and day.  45  This lack of association is\nparticularly prevalent in the napping literature (for review see Hilditch et\nal, 2017  47  ).  45  ,  48  \u2013  50  Perhaps the most striking observation\ncomes from Lovato et al  48  who, despite 91% of participants waking from SWS\nand over 50% of the prior sleep period containing SWS, did not observe any\nperformance impairment following a nap taken during a simulated night shift.\n\nThe debate in the literature as to whether sleep depth influences sleep\ninertia may be due to variations in methodologies and definitions of sleep\ndepth. A direct comparison of the studies presented here, however, reveals\nsome common factors that may help to explain the apparent discrepancies. For\nexample, the effects of sleep depth on sleep inertia tend to be observed\nfollowing longer naps (2 hrs)  27  ,  30  compared to shorter naps (20\u201360\nmins),  45  and under higher homeostatic pressure  27  ,  30  but rarely under\nreduced homeostatic pressure.  27  ,  33  ,  51  ,  52  These studies suggest\nthat the influence of sleep depth on sleep inertia may be mediated by the\nlengths of both prior wakefulness and prior sleep. From the limited studies\nreviewed, the effect of time of day does not appear to interact with this\nrelationship;  33  ,  44  ,  45  however, its direct influence on sleep\ninertia  33  might still obscure measurement of the direct influence of sleep\ndepth. Thus, interactions with prior sleep\u2013wake factors appear to change the\nrelative influence of sleep depth on subsequent performance, although a direct\ninvestigation of these interactions has not been conducted.\n\nOverall, it is difficult to synthesize a clear conclusion as to the role of\nSWS in sleep inertia. There is long-standing evidence supporting the\nassociation between greater sleep depth and greater sleep inertia.  27  ,  30\n,  41  This traditional view, however, is now being challenged by more recent\nliterature which suggests that this relationship may not be as robust as\ninitially thought.  33  ,  45  Different study designs and measures of sleep\ndepth make it difficult to compare between studies. However, the current\nliterature suggests that the lengths of prior wakefulness and prior sleep may\ninfluence the association between sleep depth and sleep inertia.\n\n###  Impact of contributing factors on sleep inertia duration\n\nThe majority of studies examining sleep inertia were not designed to directly\nassess the duration of sleep inertia and therefore include too few data points\nto make firm conclusions about the impact of contributing factors on the\nduration of sleep inertia. In addition, most studies directly observing the\ntime course of sleep inertia have not directly compared contributing factors.\nOne study, however, did directly observe the duration of sleep inertia under\ntwo different conditions. Achermann et al's study  44  observed that the time\ncourse of sleep inertia following an 8-h nocturnal sleep episode and a 2-h\nevening nap was the same, suggesting that circadian timing and sleep duration\nunder these conditions did not impact duration. Brooks and Lack  37  compared\nfour different short, afternoon nap lengths and found that while a 10-min nap\nresulted in immediate performance improvements, a 30-min nap did not provide\nimprovements until 35 mins or up to 95 mins after waking, depending on the\ntask. This suggests that the duration of sleep inertia is dependent on both\nlength of nap and type of task. Comparing across studies, Hilditch et al  38\nfound that both a 10-min and 30-min nap terminated at 04:00 following acute\nsleep loss provided no improvements to performance throughout the sleep\ninertia testing period (up to 60 mins) nor across the remainder of the night\n(up to 2.5 hrs).  53  Taken together, these studies suggest that circadian\ntiming and prior sleep-wake history influence sleep inertia duration as well\nas severity, although the relative influence of these factors cannot be\ndetermined from these observations.\n\n###  Sleep inertia in the absence of high homeostatic and circadian pressures\n\nWhile the factors discussed above have been shown to exacerbate sleep inertia\neffects, it is important to note that sleep inertia has been observed even in\nthe absence of these factors. For example, Wertz et al's  54  striking\ndemonstration of the impact of sleep inertia relative to 24 hrs of wakefulness\nwas observed in healthy participants, following an 8-h, habitually-timed sleep\nopportunity. Similarly, studies have demonstrated sleep inertia effects\nlasting at least one hour under unremarkable, well-rested conditions.  44  ,\n51  Results from studies measuring performance and alertness after waking from\ndaytime naps also show signs of sleep inertia, even when the prior night of\nsleep is unrestricted.  44  ,  55  Scheer et al  33  demonstrated the\ncircadian influence on sleep inertia magnitude in non-sleep restricted\nconditions, but also showed that sleep inertia is present, albeit less severe,\nduring times outside of the circadian low. Finally, Hilditch et al  50\nobserved performance impairment immediately following a 10-min nap taken at\n07:00 following extended wakefulness, demonstrating that a short nap,\ndepending on the context, does not always avoid sleep inertia. Together, the\nfindings from these studies suggest that sleep inertia is a ubiquitous\nphenomenon that, while exacerbated by certain factors, can potentially occur\nat any time.\n\n##  Consequences: effects of sleep inertia on neurobehavioral outcomes\n\nDespite its relatively short-acting effects, sleep inertia is a notable cause\nof performance impairment and has been associated with severe, real-world\nconsequences.\n\n###  Time course of sleep inertia effects\n\nStudies comparing sleep inertia to pre-sleep values have typically shown a\nreturn to these levels within 30 mins of awakening  36  ,  37  ,  46  ,  48  ,\n56  and sometimes as soon as 15 mins after awakening.  45  ,  52  ,  57\nStudies that have systematically measured alertness and performance across the\nperiod after waking, however, report an asymptotic dissipation of sleep\ninertia.  9  ,  44  ,  51  While the initial dissipation of impairment is\nrapid, full recovery does not appear to be complete until at least an hour\nafter awakening. Jewett et al  51  investigated the time course of sleep\ninertia in a constant routine protocol in which measures of subjective\nalertness and cognitive throughput were taken regularly from one minute to\nfour hours after scheduled awakening. Under these conditions, Jewett et al  51\nfound, as in the findings of Folkard and \u00c5kerstedt,  9  that subjective\nalertness continued to improve for up to two hours after awakening.\nPerformance impairment on an addition task, however, took up to 3.5 hrs to\ndissipate.  51  These tests were performed following a habitual morning\nawakening, so the influence of the rise in circadian alertness across this\nperiod cannot be extricated from this observation.\n\nInterestingly, subjective alertness recovered faster than objective\nperformance in Jewett et al's  51  study, but was slower in Achermann et al's\n44  study. Achermann et al  44  also reported that there was no correlation\nbetween objective performance and subjective sleepiness. The difference in\ntime course in performance measures between the two studies may be explained\nby differences in the tasks performed. However, the desynchronization of time\ncourse between subjective and objective measures in both studies highlights a\nconcern when using self-assessment after waking, especially if alertness\nrecovers faster than cognitive performance. Subjective ratings of alertness\nand performance have been shown to be inconsistent predictors of objective\nperformance under conditions of partial  58  and chronic  59  sleep loss.\nAchermann et al's  44  study suggests that subjective ratings might also be a\npoor indicator of performance across the dissipation of sleep inertia.\nHilditch et al  38  reported a self-rating scale of performance (as opposed to\nalertness) across the dissipation of sleep inertia and found that despite\nworse objective performance after waking from a 30-min night-time nap compared\nto pre-nap, participants rated their performance as significantly better\nduring this period. These findings highlight the need to measure both\nsubjective and objective outcomes when investigating sleep inertia effects.\nFurthermore, a recent study by Ritchie et al  60  suggests that a\nparticipant\u2019s morning or evening preference (chronotype) should also be\nmeasured when estimating the time course of sleep inertia, with the\nobservation that later chronotypes took longer to recover from sleep inertia\nthan early types.\n\n###  Comparison of the effects of sleep inertia with the effects of sleep loss\n\nDespite a relatively rapid recovery from sleep inertia in the first 15\u201330 mins\nafter waking, impairment during this initial period can be equivalent to, or\nworse than, the effects of sleep loss. For example, Wertz et al  54  showed\nthat performance on an addition test immediately after waking was\nsignificantly more impaired than after one night of sleep deprivation.\nSimilarly, Miccoli et al  28  found no difference in mean response times on a\n10-min psychomotor vigilance test (PVT; a simple response time task) for the\nfirst hour following a night of sleep deprivation compared to waking from a\nnight of restricted sleep. This indicates that any benefits of the three hours\nof sleep in the partial sleep restriction condition were masked by sleep\ninertia for at least an hour after waking. Remarkably, Rosa et al  29  found\nthat waking from two hours of recovery sleep following 64 hrs of sleep\ndeprivation was associated with worse performance on both a memory task and\nauditory reaction time task compared to before the recovery sleep. Performance\nafter waking was also worse than at the same time of day during the prior\nsleep deprivation period (ie after approximately 41 hrs of wakefulness).\n\nIn another study involving 64 hrs of sleep deprivation, a group given 20-min\nnaps every six hours across this period performed worse after waking than the\ntotal sleep deprivation group. Furthermore, the sleep inertia experienced\nafter short naps was so intolerable that six participants in the nap condition\nwithdrew from the study, whereas all participants in the sleep deprivation\ngroup completed the study.  61\n\nTogether, the findings from these studies highlight the potential severity of\nsleep inertia performance deficits relative to extreme sleep loss.\nFurthermore, these results suggest that, at least in the short term,\nperformance impairment after waking from recovery sleep can actually be worse\nthan the impairment caused by the prior sleep loss itself. Therefore,\nfollowing prior sleep loss, observable benefits from recovery sleep may be\ndelayed by sleep inertia for up to an hour after waking.\n\n###  Impact of sleep inertia on different measures of cognitive performance\n\nAs the sleep inertia literature expands, a debate has begun as to whether all\ncognitive tasks are equally affected immediately after waking. Some studies\nhave found that, in contrast to the impairment observed after sleep\ndeprivation, only the reaction time or \u201cspeed\u201d component of tasks is\nnegatively affected during sleep inertia.  28  ,  46  ,  52  ,  55  ,  61  ,\n62  However, several other studies have found equal effects on both speed and\naccuracy  27  ,  31  ,  45  or greater effects on accuracy.  63  Variations\nbetween studies such as task type, time of testing, instructions to the\nparticipants (eg instructed to perform as fast and/or as accurately as\npossible), and the length and timing of sleep may account for these\ndiscrepancies. Two studies have also claimed that, while overall average\nresponse speed may slow as a result of sleep inertia, lapses, which represent\na substantial delay in response speed, are not a neurobehavioral feature of\nsleep inertia, but rather are only associated with sleep loss induced\nmicrosleeps.  28  ,  52\n\nIt has also been argued that higher cognitive tasks that require greater\nattentional load are more susceptible to the effects of sleep inertia than\nsimple tasks.  64  ,  65  Studies have reported the effects of sleep inertia\non complex cognitive performance tasks such as memory,  44  calculations,  30\n,  54  ,  65  decision making,  42  ,  66  and a spatial-configuration visual\nsearch task.  65  However, sleep inertia has also been observed using simple\nreaction time tasks.  26  ,  45  ,  62  Conflicting results have also been\nobtained with regard to effect sizes across different tasks. Santhi et al  62\nshowed the largest effect sizes for simpler tasks such as PVT and a 1-back\nworking memory task compared to a 3-back working memory task. In another\nstudy, medium effect sizes were found for moderately complex tasks such as\naddition and digit-symbol substitution, but the largest effect size was\nreported for cognitive throughput on a higher-order spatial-configuration\ntask.  65  Given the range of methodologies used across these studies, a clear\nhypothesis for the differential effects observed across tasks has yet to be\nput forward.\n\n###  Real-world impacts of sleep inertia\n\nSleep inertia is a challenge to workers who need to perform safety-critical\ntasks, make important decisions, or operate a vehicle soon after waking. To\nthis end, several reviews of alertness management in operational settings have\nhighlighted the need to manage sleep inertia in order to maintain safety.  64\n,  67  \u2013  69\n\nWhile some facets of cognition may be more affected by sleep inertia than\nothers,  62  ,  65  real-world tasks often involve a combination of multiple\ncognitive domains. For example, operating a vehicle safely requires\nsituational awareness, information processing, decision making, memory and, in\nsome instances, rapid response times. Studies of complex psychomotor tasks\nthat better emulate tasks in the real world, for example, a fire management\ntask,  42  a military enemy attack exercise,  66  or putting on a space suit,\n8  have all been shown to be susceptible to the effects of sleep inertia.\nFurther, interviews with nurses  70  and surveys of emergency service pilots\n71  have identified sleep inertia as a prevalent issue amongst on-call and\nnight shift workers. In the military, a retrospective analysis of more than\n400 US Air Force accidents showed that accidents associated with pilot error\nwere most common during the first hour after waking, suggesting a potential\nsleep inertia effect.  72  Sleep inertia has also been cited as a contributing\nfactor in several commercial incidents across multiple industries which have\nresulted in damage,  73  ,  74  injuries,  75  and deaths.  76\n\nTaken together, these findings suggest that the effects of sleep inertia on\nsimple, complex, and operational tasks has the potential to negatively impact\nupon safety-critical activities in the real world.\n\n##  Countermeasures to sleep inertia\n\nOur knowledge of the factors influencing sleep inertia can help to develop\nproactive strategies for managing sleep inertia, such as optimal sleep length\nand timing of awakening. For example, based on the literature summarized\nabove, a planned awakening should take into account as many of the following\ncriteria as possible: limit the duration of the period of wakefulness before\nthe sleep episode; minimize the amount of sleep loss prior to the sleep\nepisode \u2013 both acute and chronic; avoid waking during the circadian low in\nalertness (biological night); and, if waking from a nap, limit sleep duration\nto less than 30 mins. While following these guidelines can reduce the risk of\nsleep inertia, as discussed earlier, they do not guarantee a sleep inertia-\nfree wake up. Thus, the most effective proactive countermeasure appears to be\ncaffeine. When taken before a short nap (eg 20 mins), caffeine has been shown\nto alleviate the symptoms of sleep inertia following the nap.  26  ,  77  The\nlimitation of these proactive strategies is that they often require a planned\nsleep opportunity, a designated wake time, and control over prior sleep-wake\nhistory. For many on-call shift workers it is not always feasible to plan the\nlength and timing of a sleep opportunity, and in many cases prior sleep-wake\nhistory may be poor. Thus, there is a need for countermeasures that can be\nimplemented upon waking (\u201creactive\u201d countermeasures).\n\nHilditch et al  78  recently reviewed the literature investigating reactive\ncountermeasures and concluded that there is currently no clear empirical\nevidence to fully support the use of any reactive countermeasure to provide\nimmediate and objective effects. As mentioned above, when administered before\nsleep, caffeine has been shown to eliminate the effects of sleep inertia.  26\nHowever, there are several limitations to the effectiveness and application of\nthis countermeasure in a reactive scenario. When administered after sleep,\neven in a rapidly-absorbed chewing gum format, the effects of caffeine are\ndelayed such that while the duration of sleep inertia may be truncated, the\ninitial, most severe period of effects are unaffected by caffeine.  79\nFurthermore, while caffeine is indeed a field-deployable and operationally\nviable countermeasure in many cases, the relatively long-lasting stimulant\neffects may be unwanted in situations in which it is preferable for the worker\nto fall back asleep within a few hours of waking.  80\n\nOther countermeasures such as light, sound, and temperature have been\ninvestigated. The outcomes of the trials, however, have been either\nunsuccessful, or uninterpretable due to methodological limitations such as\nlack of a control group, not enough testing points, or no evidence of sleep\ninertia in the control condition.  81  \u2013  86  We below summarize findings of\nthe most commonly investigated countermeasures.\n\nTo date, two studies have investigated the use of brief  81  and sustained  82\nlight exposure after waking to reduce sleep inertia. Bright light exposure has\nbeen shown to directly improve alertness and cognitive performance during the\nday, night and following sleep restriction.  87  Therefore, there is potential\nfor bright light to improve alertness and performance during the sleep inertia\nperiod. One study reported a significant improvement to subjective alertness,\nhowever, neither study observed a significant improvement on objective\nperformance measures. While these results suggest that both brief and\nsustained light exposure after waking is of limited effectiveness in reducing\nsleep inertia effects, it is worth noting that the exposures in these studies\nwere during the day (~07:00 and 13:00). The use of light during nocturnal\nawakenings may, therefore, have a different effect.\n\nNoise can promote arousal and has previously been shown to attenuate hypo-\nvigilance during sleep deprivation.  88  ,  89  Early investigations on the\nuse of sound to reduce sleep inertia effects have been promising. Tassi et al\n83  exposed participants to pink noise after a 1-h nap at 01:00 and observed\nthat pink noise eliminated the sleep inertia effect observed in the no-noise\ngroup. This effect was less obvious when tested at 04:00. The sleep stage at\nwaking was not controlled in this study and may have contributed to the mixed\nresults at different test times. Hayashi et al  84  took a different approach,\nplaying music after waking from a short afternoon nap. While playing music has\nnot been shown to have a long-term alerting effect,  90  its short-term\neffects may be useful in the context of sleep inertia. Indeed, the researchers\nreported that music reduced subjective sleepiness, and that music preferred by\nthe participants led to improved cognitive performance for up to 20 mins after\nwaking. Sound may be an operationally viable (ie delivered through headphones)\nand relatively brief and immediate alerting strategy for use in the field.\n\nWhile the relationship of body temperature to sleep onset has been extensively\ninvestigated, its relationship to sleep offset has received less attention.\nSome studies have shown, however, that changes in the distal-proximal\ntemperature gradient (DPG) after waking correlate with subjective sleepiness.\n85  This relationship has been demonstrated across different circadian phases\nin a multi-nap protocol but has yet to be tested with objective performance\nmeasures.  86  It has been proposed that cooling the extremities immediately\nafter waking may accelerate the DPG changes and, in turn, accelerate recovery\nfrom sleep inertia effects. This theory has yet to be tested with an\nintervention study. Manipulating body temperature may also be a useful\ndeployable strategy, the effects of which may be reversible in situations\nwhere a sleep opportunity is presented later in the night.\n\nWhile there are no studies to our knowledge that have investigated the\neffectiveness of exercise to reduce sleep inertia effects, anecdotally this is\nan avenue that may be worthy of research. Sleep inertia is associated with a\nslow return to waking levels of cerebral blood flow in the anterior cortical\nregions of the brain;  23  therefore, moderate cardiac activity may accelerate\nthis process. Implementation of this strategy would also be relatively\nconvenient in most work place settings.\n\nGiven the potential for catastrophic events associated with sleep inertia, the\nneed to develop preventative strategies and reactive countermeasures to\nminimize both the severity and duration of sleep inertia effects in safety-\ncritical scenarios is crucial.\n\n##  Summary\n\nAs discussed in the previous sections, sleep inertia is characterized by\nimpaired performance and reduced alertness immediately after waking. These\neffects dissipate asymptotically with the most significant effects occurring\nwithin 30 mins of waking. Sleep inertia interacts with the homeostatic and\ncircadian processes to influence performance immediately after waking.\nEvidence suggests that waking after acute or chronic prior sleep loss, during\nthe circadian low, or from deeper stages of sleep can exacerbate sleep\ninertia. Sleep inertia is of great importance as the associated performance\nimpairment can be equivalent to, or greater than, that observed after up to 40\nhrs of sleep deprivation. Sleep inertia effects have been observed on a range\nof tasks from simple reaction time tests to complex cognitive tasks. While\nfield studies of sleep inertia are lacking, evidence of sleep inertia in real-\nworld scenarios has been demonstrated in several operational incidents, often\nwith catastrophic consequences. While there is evidence that caffeine can help\nto reduce the impact of sleep inertia, there is a need for further research\ninto reactive countermeasures that can be deployed in operational scenarios.\n\n##  Acknowledgment\n\nDr. Hilditch is supported by a NASA System Wide Safety grant.

Low ArTH was defined based on PSG indices.\n\n###  Results\n\nOf 5,748 OSA patients, 36.80% met the CC criteria, and 42.88% the APOC\ncriteria, for POSA. The prevalence of POSA was significantly higher in women\nthan men (40.21% and 46.52% vs. 36.13% and 42.18% for CC and APOC,\nrespectively). Chinese POSA patients had a lower apnea hypopnea index (AHI)\nand lower oxygen desaturation index, shorter duration of oxygen saturation\n(SaO  2  ) < 90%, and a higher mean SaO  2  and higher lowest SaO  2  value\ncompared to subjects with non-positional OSA (NPOSA). More than 40% of the\nPOSA patients had a low ArTH; the proportion was extremely high in the supine-\nisolated-POSA (si-POSA) group and APOC I group. In multivariate logistic\nregression analyses, higher mean SaO  2  and lower AHI during sleep were\npositive predictors of POSA.\n\n###  Conclusions\n\nAccording to the CC and APOC criteria, more than 1/3 of our Chinese subjects\nwith OSA had POSA. Chinese POSA patients had less severe OSA and nocturnal\nhypoxia. Compared to NPOSA patients, significantly more patients with POSA had\na low ArTH. A low ArTH may be an important endotype in the pathogenesis of\nPOSA, especially in patients with si-POSA and APOC I. Further studies are\nnecessary to develop personalized management strategies for POSA patients.\n\n_Trial registration:_ Chinese Clinical Trial Registry; URL: [\nhttp://www.chictr.org.cn ](http://www.chictr.org.cn) ; No. ChiCTR1900025714\n(retrospectively registered).\n\n##  Introduction\n\nStudies have shown that as many as 9\u201338% of adults suffer from long-term sleep\ndisorders [ [ 1 ](/articles/10.1186/s12931-022-02141-3#ref-CR1 \"Benjafield AV,\nAyas NT, Eastwood PR, Heinzer R, Ip MSM, Morrell MJ, et al.

OSA can be classified as positional OSA (POSA) or non-positional OSA (NPOSA) according to whether the occurrence of respiratory events is associated with the body position during sleep.

Therefore, the prevalence of POSA in ethnic Chinese populations is likely to differ from that in other races. However, there has been only one previous study of Chinese POSA patients, which used single criterion, had a small sample size and limited subgroup analyses, and did not adjust for confounding factors [ [ 14 ](/articles/10.1186/s12931-022-02141-3#ref-CR14 \"Wang X, Luo J, Huang R, Yi X.

Thus, the prevalence of POSA in the general Chinese population, and the characteristics of those with the condition, remain unknown. Due to the increasing socioeconomic burden of OSA in China, it is essential to identify the clinical characteristics of Chinese POSA patients to provide individualized treatment.\n\nIt is important to elucidate the pathophysiology of POSA to develop optimal\ntreatment methods [ [ 25 ](/articles/10.1186/s12931-022-02141-3#ref-CR25\n\"Taranto-Montemurro L, Messineo L, Wellman A.

J Clin Med. 2019.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.3390/jcm8111846\n\n.\") ]. A low respiratory arousal threshold (ArTH), i.e., easy arousal from sleep in response to relatively mild airway obstruction, is one of the non-anatomical physiological factors associated with OSA [  26  ,  27  , [ 28 ](/articles/10.1186/s12931-022-02141-3#ref-CR28 \"Younes M.

Patients with a low ArTH are unlikely to be adherent to continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment [ [ 29 ](/articles/10.1186/s12931-022-02141-3#ref-CR29 \"Zinchuk AV, Chu JH, Liang J, Celik Y, de Op Beeck S, Redeker NS, et al.

Therefore, it is important to understand the prevalence and effects of non-anatomical traits in OSA. However, data regarding the pathogenesis of POSA, especially with ArTH, in large clinical populations remain scarce. This large-scale study was performed to evaluate the prevalence, clinical characteristics, and ArTH of POSA patients in China, and to identify possible predictors of POSA.\n\n##  Methods\n\n###  Subject recruitment\n\nStudy subjects were enrolled between May 15, 2007, and December 31, 2018, at\nour sleep center as part of the Shanghai Sleep Health Study cohort. This study\nwas conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the study\nprotocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of Shanghai Jiao Tong University\nAffiliated Sixth People\u2019s Hospital (Approval No: 2019-KY-050[K]). The study\nwas registered at the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (No. ChiCTR1900025714).\nAll subjects provided informed consent.\n\nEthnic Chinese participants aged \u2265 18 years with snoring or daytime sleepiness\nand undergoing laboratory polysomnography (PSG), were screened for eligibility\nfor inclusion in the study. OSA subjects who had been treated previously or\nhad other comorbid sleep disorders (insomnia, narcolepsy, upper airway\nresistance syndrome, or restless legs syndrome) were excluded. Subjects taking\nanxiolytics, antidepressants, antipsychotics, or hypnotic drugs were also\nexcluded. Data from participants with total sleep time (TST) \u2265 4 h, sleep time\nin each position \u2265 30 min, and \u2265 10% of the TST in both the best sleeping\nposition (BSP) and worst sleeping position (WSP) were considered suitable for\ninclusion in the study. All subjects completed a comprehensive questionnaire\npertaining to alcohol consumption, smoking, and medication use, before PSG.\n\n###  Clinical evaluation\n\nHeight (m), weight (kg), neck circumference (NC) (cm), waist circumference\n(WC) (cm), hip circumference (HC) (cm), and blood pressure (mmHg) were\nrecorded as the mean values of two consecutive measurements before PSG. Body\nmass index (BMI) was calculated as weight divided by height squared (kg/m  2\n). Fasting blood samples were taken from each subject the morning after PSG.\nThe glycolipid metabolism index was measured in our laboratory. The\nhomeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) index was\ncalculated as fasting insulin (\u03bcU/mL) multiplied by fasting glucose (mmol/L)\nand the result was divided by 22.5 [ [ 30\n](/articles/10.1186/s12931-022-02141-3#ref-CR30 \"Bonora E, Targher G,\nAlberiche M, Bonadonna RC, Saggiani F, Zenere MB, et al.

During\nthe laboratory-based PSG, electroencephalogram, electrooculogram,\nelectrocardiogram, and electromyogram recordings were obtained. Nasal airflow\nwas measured using a nasal pressure cannula, and blood oxygen saturation was\nmeasured by a finger pulse oximeter. A belt containing a piezoelectric\ntransducer was used to record chest and abdominal movements. An accelerator-\nbased position sensor placed at the sternum was used to distinguish among the\nsupine, prone, right, left, and upright positions with simultaneous infrared\nvideo recording (reviewed only in ambiguous cases) [ [ 34\n](/articles/10.1186/s12931-022-02141-3#ref-CR34 \"Hidalgo Armas L, Ingles S,\nVaca R, Cordero-Guevara J, Duran Carro J, Ullate J, et al.

Therefore, the final study sample consisted\nof 7,110 patients (Fig. [ 1 ](/articles/10.1186/s12931-022-02141-3#Fig1) ) of\nwhom the clinical and sleep characteristics were showed in Additional file [ 2\n](/articles/10.1186/s12931-022-02141-3#MOESM2) : Table S1. Of the 5,748 OSA\npatients, 36.80% met the CC criteria, and 42.88% the APOC criteria, for POSA\n(Fig. [ 2 ](/articles/10.1186/s12931-022-02141-3#Fig2) ). The prevalence of\nPOSA was significantly higher in women than men according to both the CC\n(Table [ 1 ](/articles/10.1186/s12931-022-02141-3#Tab1) ) and APOC (Table [ 2\n](/articles/10.1186/s12931-022-02141-3#Tab2) ) criteria (40.21% and 46.52% in\nwomen vs. 36.13%, 42.18% in men, respectively).

As BMI increased, the\nprevalence of POSA decreased (Additional file [ 1\n](/articles/10.1186/s12931-022-02141-3#MOESM1) : Fig. S1), especially in the\nsi-POSA and APOC I groups.\n\nWith regard to sleep structure, the percentages of SWS and REM stage sleep\nwere significantly higher in the POSA than NPOSA group according to the CC\n(Table [ 1 ](/articles/10.1186/s12931-022-02141-3#Tab1) ) and APOC (Table [ 2\n](/articles/10.1186/s12931-022-02141-3#Tab2) ) criteria ( _P_ < 0.01 for SWS,\n_P < _ 0.05 for REM stage sleep [for both criteria sets]). Furthermore, the\nsi-POSA group had a higher percentage of SWS and lower percentage of N1 stage\nsleep than the sp-POSA group. Meanwhile, the percentage of SWS was\nsignificantly higher, and the percentage of N1 stage sleep was significantly\nlower, in the APOC I group than APOC II and APOC III groups. The POSA group\nhad a shorter TST and lower sleep efficiency according to the CC (Table [ 1\n](/articles/10.1186/s12931-022-02141-3#Tab1) ) and APOC (Table [ 2\n](/articles/10.1186/s12931-022-02141-3#Tab2) ) criteria (all _P_ < 0.001).

The POSA group had a higher\nabsolute fraction of hypopneas. The percentages of AHI < 30 events/h, LSaO  2\n> 82.5%, and hypopnea proportion > 58.3%, were higher in the POSA than NPOSA\ngroup, and higher in the si-POSA than sp-POSA group. In the si-POSA and sp-\nPOSA groups, the proportions of low ArTH (71.13% and 31.86%, respectively)\nwere significantly higher compared to the NPOSA group (22.85%) (Table [ 1\n](/articles/10.1186/s12931-022-02141-3#Tab1) ).

As the major determinants of OSA severity in Chinese patients are anatomical, rather than non-anatomical, the ArTH may have been slightly overestimated for a given level of OSA severity which is similar in non-ethnic Chinese population.

As OSA severity exhibits a considerable night-to-night variability, the sleep position that determines the phenotype of POSA might show similar variability. Recording the sleeping position for several consecutive nights may be necessary to confirm the POSA phenotype. Nonetheless, this study adds to the literature by shedding light on the prevalence of POSA in China, and the clinical characteristics and ArTH of Chinese POSA patients.\n\n##  Conclusion\n\nAmong the subjects with OSA included in this study, 36.80% and 42.88% met the\nCC and APOC criteria for POSA, respectively. Chinese POSA patients had less\nsevere OSA and nocturnal hypoxia compared to the si-POSA and APOC I groups. In\ncomparison with NPOSA patients, significantly more patients with POSA had a\nlow ArTH. A low ArTH may be an important endotype in the pathogenesis of POSA.\nFurther studies are necessary to develop personalized management strategies\nfor patients with POSA.\n\n##  Current knowledge/study rationale\n\nThere is strong evidence that the severity of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)\ncan worsen when sleeping in the supine position, which is known as positional\nOSA (POSA). While POSA is prevalent among adults, there are limited data on\nthe presence and characteristics of POSA in China. In addition, studies of\nlarge clinical populations examining how the respiratory arousal threshold\n(ArTH), a key physiological trait, is involved in the pathogenesis of POSA,\nwhich may influence adherence to continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP),\nare lacking. This study was performed to assess the prevalence,\ncharacteristics, and ArTH of POSA in a large Chinese cohort.\n\n##  Study impact\n\nMore than 1/3 of our Chinese subjects with OSA had POSA, which was especially\nprevalent among those with mild OSA. The rate was lower than in Western\nstudies because of the differences in anatomical and non-anatomical factors\nbetween Chinese and Western populations. A low ArTH is more common in patients\nwith POSA compared to those with non-positional OSA (NPOSA). These data\nsuggest that millions of Chinese people have POSA, where assessment of ArTH\ncan help identify patients at risk of poor CPAP adherence, and may inform the\nselection of targeted therapy to improve CPAP use. Personalized treatment,\nsuch as the use of positional therapy devices, should be considered when\ntreating POSA, and may be beneficial for individuals with poor adherence to\nCPAP.\n\n##  Availability of data and materials\n\nThe datasets used and analyzed in this study are available from Hongliang Yi,\nthe corresponding author, on reasonable request.\n\n##  Abbreviations\n\nAASM:\n\n\n\nAmerican Academy of Sleep Medicine\n\nAHI:\n\n\n\nApnea\u2013hypopnea index\n\nAPOC:\n\n\n\nAmsterdam Positional Obstructive Sleep Apnea Classification\n\nArTH:\n\n\n\nRespiratory arousal threshold\n\nBMI:\n\n\n\nBody mass index\n\nBSP:\n\n\n\nBest sleeping position\n\nCC:\n\n\n\nCartwright Classification\n\nCI:\n\n\n\nConfidence interval\n\nCPAP:\n\n\n\nContinuous positive airway pressure\n\nCT90:\n\n\n\nCumulative time of oxygen saturation < 90%\n\nCVD:\n\n\n\nCardiovascular disease\n\nEDS:\n\n\n\nExcessive daytime sleepiness\n\nESS:\n\n\n\nEpworth Sleepiness Scale\n\nHC:\n\n\n\nHip circumference\n\nHOMA-IR:\n\n\n\nHomeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance\n\nLSaO2:\n\n\n\nLowest oxygen saturation\n\nMAI:\n\n\n\nMicroarousal index\n\nMS:\n\n\n\nMetabolic syndrome\n\nNC:\n\n\n\nNeck circumference\n\nNPOSA:\n\n\n\nNon-positional obstructive sleep apnea\n\nNREM:\n\n\n\nNon-rapid eye movement sleep\n\nODI:\n\n\n\nOxygen desaturation index\n\nOR:\n\n\n\nOdds ratio\n\nOSA:\n\n\n\nObstructive sleep apnea\n\nPOSA:\n\n\n\nPositional obstructive sleep apnea\n\nPSG:\n\n\n\nPolysomnography\n\nREM:\n\n\n\nRapid eye movement sleep\n\nSaO2:\n\n\n\nOxygen saturation\n\nsi-POSA:\n\n\n\nSupine-isolated positional obstructive sleep apnea\n\nsp-POSA:\n\n\n\nSupine-predominant positional obstructive sleep apnea\n\nSWS:\n\n\n\nSlow wave sleep\n\nTST:\n\n\n\nTotal sleep time\n\nWC:\n\n\n\nWaist circumference\n\nWSP:\n\n\n\nWorst sleeping position\n\n##  References\n\n1.

Did you\nknow, by the time you are aged 60 you are likely to require three times more\nlight than when you were aged 20?\n\nImproving the lighting in your home doesn't require a lot of difficult or\ncomplicated adaptations. Often, lighting can be improved by:\n\n  * Plugging a table, desk or floor light into existing sockets \n  * Fitting bulbs that give more light \n  * Changing shades and fittings to increase light levels or change the direction of light to reflect from white surfaces \n  * Fitting shades that don't shield light. \n\nLighting in and around the home: A guide to better lighting for people with\nvisual impairment  , written by the Thomas Pocklington Trust, contains more\ninformation on the importance of lighting. It provides advice on the different\ntypes of light bulbs and lighting available, choosing lighting and how to\ncreate a safer home and stay as independent at home as possible.\n\nA full range of lighting products for your home are available to buy in the\nlighting section of the RNIB Online Shop  .\n\n###  Lighting solutions\n\nMake the most of your sight and increase the light in your home with daylight\nbulbs and magnifier lights.

But after that short burst of sweetness, you may worry about how sweets affect your waistline and your overall health. Is sugar really bad for us? How about artificial or low-calorie sweeteners? What have scientists learned about the sweet things that most of us eat and drink every day? Our bodies need one type of sugar, called glucose A type of sugar used by the body for energy. When blood glucose levels get too high, it can damage tissues and organs over time. , to survive. \u201cGlucose is the number one food for the brain, and it\u2019s an extremely important source of fuel throughout the body,\u201d says Dr. Kristina Rother, an NIH pediatrician and expert on sweeteners. But there\u2019s no need to add glucose to your diet, because your body can make the glucose it needs by breaking down food molecules like carbohydrates A class of food molecule that includes sugars, starches, and fibers. , proteins, and fats. Some sugars are found naturally in foods, such as fruits, vegetables, and milk. \u201cThese are healthful additions to your diet,\u201d says Dr. Andrew Bremer, a pediatrician and NIH expert on sweeteners. \u201cWhen you eat an orange, for instance, you\u2019re getting a lot of nutrients and dietary fiber along with the natural sugars.\u201d Although sugar itself isn\u2019t bad, says Rother, \u201csugar has a bad reputation that\u2019s mostly deserved because we consume too much of it. It\u2019s now in just about every food we eat.\u201d Experts agree that Americans eat and drink way too much sugar, and it\u2019s contributing to the obesity epidemic. Much of the sugar we eat isn\u2019t found naturally in food but is added during processing or preparation. About 15% of the calories in the American adult diet come from added sugars. That\u2019s about 22 teaspoons of added sugar a day. Sugars are usually added to make foods and drinks taste better. But such foods can be high in calories and offer none of the healthful benefits of fruits and other naturally sweet foods. Sugar-sweetened beverages like soda, energy drinks, and sports drinks are the leading source of added sugars in the American diet. Juices naturally contain a lot of sugar. But sometimes, even more is added to make them taste sweeter. \u201cJuices offer some vitamins and other nutrients, but I think those benefits are greatly offset by the harmful effects of too much sugar,\u201d says Bremer. Over time, excess sweeteners can take a toll on your health. \u201cSeveral studies have found a direct link between excess sugar consumption and obesity and cardiovascular problems worldwide,\u201d Bremer says. Because of these harmful effects, many health organizations recommend that Americans cut back on added sugars. But added sugars can be hard to identify. On a list of ingredients, they may be listed as sucrose (table sugar), corn sweetener, high-fructose corn syrup, fruit-juice concentrates, nectars, raw sugar, malt syrup, maple syrup, fructose sweeteners, liquid fructose, honey, molasses, anhydrous dextrose, or other words ending in \u201c- ose,\u201d the chemical suffix for sugars. If any of these words are among the first few ingredients on a food label, the food is likely high in sugar. The total amount of sugar in a food is listed under \u201cTotal Carbohydrate\u201d on the Nutrition Facts label. Many people try cutting back on calories by switching from sugar-sweetened to diet foods and drinks that contain low- or no-calorie sweeteners. These artificial sweeteners\u2014also known as sugar substitutes\u2014are many times sweeter than table sugar, so smaller amounts are needed to create the same level of sweetness. People have debated the safety of artificial sweeteners for decades. To date, researchers have found no clear evidence that any artificial sweeteners approved for use in the U.S. cause cancer or other serious health problems in humans. But can they help with weight loss? Scientific evidence is mixed. Some studies suggest that diet drinks can help you drop pounds in the short term, but weight tends to creep back up over time. Rother and other NIH-funded researchers are now working to better understand the complex effects that artificial sweeteners can have on the human body. Studies of rodents and small numbers of people suggest that artificial sweeteners can affect the healthful gut microbes that help us digest food. This in turn can alter the body\u2019s ability to use glucose, which might then lead to weight gain. But until larger studies are done in people, the long-term impact of these sweeteners on gut microbes and weight remains uncertain. \u201cThere\u2019s much controversy about the health effects of artificial sweeteners and the differences between sugars and sweeteners,\u201d says Dr. Ivan de Araujo of Yale University. \u201cSome animal studies indicate that sweeteners can produce physiological effects. But depending on what kind of measurement is taken, including in humans, the outcomes may be conflicting.\u201d De Araujo and others have been studying the effects that sugars and low-calorie sweeteners might have on the brain. His animal studies found that sugar and sweeteners tap differently into the brain\u2019s reward circuitry, with sugars having a more powerful and pleasurable effect. \u201cThe part of the brain that mediates the \u2018I can\u2019t stop\u2019 kinds of behaviors seems to be especially sensitive to sugars and largely insensitive to artificial sweeteners,\u201d de Araujo says. \u201cOur long-term goal is really to understand if sugars or caloric sweeteners drive persistent intake of food. If exposed to too much sugar, does the brain eventually change in ways that lead to excess consumption? That\u2019s what we\u2019d like to know.\u201d Some research suggests that the intensely sweet taste of artificial, low-calorie sweeteners can lead to a \u201csweet tooth,\u201d or a preference for sweet things. This in turn might lead to overeating. But more studies are needed to confirm the relative effects of caloric vs. non-caloric sweeteners. \u201cIn the long run, if you want to lose weight, you need to establish a healthy lifestyle that contains unprocessed foods, moderate calories, and more exercise,\u201d Rother says. When kids grow up eating a lot of sweet foods, they tend to develop a preference for sweets. But if you give them a variety of healthy foods like fruits and vegetables early in life, they\u2019ll develop a liking for them too. \u201cIt\u2019s important for parents to expose children to a variety of tastes early on, but realize that it often takes several attempts to get a child to eat such foods,\u201d says Bremer. \u201cDon\u2019t give up too soon.\u201d The key to good health is eating a well-balanced diet with a variety of foods and getting plenty of physical activity.

Reduce sugar in recipes. If a recipe says 1 cup, use 2/3 cup. To enhance flavor, add vanilla, cinnamon, or nutmeg. Eat fresh, canned, frozen, and dried fruits without added sugar. Choose fruits canned in their own juice rather than syrup. Use fruits to top foods like cereal and pancakes rather than sugars, syrups, or other sweet toppings.

But after that short burst of sweetness, you may worry about how sweets affect your waistline and your overall health. Is sugar really bad for us? How about artificial or low-calorie sweeteners? What have scientists learned about the sweet things that most of us eat and drink every day? Our bodies need one type of sugar, called glucose A type of sugar used by the body for energy. When blood glucose levels get too high, it can damage tissues and organs over time. , to survive. \u201cGlucose is the number one food for the brain, and it\u2019s an extremely important source of fuel throughout the body,\u201d says Dr. Kristina Rother, an NIH pediatrician and expert on sweeteners. But there\u2019s no need to add glucose to your diet, because your body can make the glucose it needs by breaking down food molecules like carbohydrates A class of food molecule that includes sugars, starches, and fibers. , proteins, and fats. Some sugars are found naturally in foods, such as fruits, vegetables, and milk. \u201cThese are healthful additions to your diet,\u201d says Dr. Andrew Bremer, a pediatrician and NIH expert on sweeteners. \u201cWhen you eat an orange, for instance, you\u2019re getting a lot of nutrients and dietary fiber along with the natural sugars.\u201d Although sugar itself isn\u2019t bad, says Rother, \u201csugar has a bad reputation that\u2019s mostly deserved because we consume too much of it. It\u2019s now in just about every food we eat.\u201d Experts agree that Americans eat and drink way too much sugar, and it\u2019s contributing to the obesity epidemic. Much of the sugar we eat isn\u2019t found naturally in food but is added during processing or preparation. About 15% of the calories in the American adult diet come from added sugars. That\u2019s about 22 teaspoons of added sugar a day. Sugars are usually added to make foods and drinks taste better. But such foods can be high in calories and offer none of the healthful benefits of fruits and other naturally sweet foods. Sugar-sweetened beverages like soda, energy drinks, and sports drinks are the leading source of added sugars in the American diet. Juices naturally contain a lot of sugar. But sometimes, even more is added to make them taste sweeter. \u201cJuices offer some vitamins and other nutrients, but I think those benefits are greatly offset by the harmful effects of too much sugar,\u201d says Bremer. Over time, excess sweeteners can take a toll on your health. \u201cSeveral studies have found a direct link between excess sugar consumption and obesity and cardiovascular problems worldwide,\u201d Bremer says. Because of these harmful effects, many health organizations recommend that Americans cut back on added sugars. But added sugars can be hard to identify. On a list of ingredients, they may be listed as sucrose (table sugar), corn sweetener, high-fructose corn syrup, fruit-juice concentrates, nectars, raw sugar, malt syrup, maple syrup, fructose sweeteners, liquid fructose, honey, molasses, anhydrous dextrose, or other words ending in \u201c- ose,\u201d the chemical suffix for sugars. If any of these words are among the first few ingredients on a food label, the food is likely high in sugar. The total amount of sugar in a food is listed under \u201cTotal Carbohydrate\u201d on the Nutrition Facts label. Many people try cutting back on calories by switching from sugar-sweetened to diet foods and drinks that contain low- or no-calorie sweeteners. These artificial sweeteners\u2014also known as sugar substitutes\u2014are many times sweeter than table sugar, so smaller amounts are needed to create the same level of sweetness. People have debated the safety of artificial sweeteners for decades. To date, researchers have found no clear evidence that any artificial sweeteners approved for use in the U.S. cause cancer or other serious health problems in humans. But can they help with weight loss? Scientific evidence is mixed. Some studies suggest that diet drinks can help you drop pounds in the short term, but weight tends to creep back up over time. Rother and other NIH-funded researchers are now working to better understand the complex effects that artificial sweeteners can have on the human body. Studies of rodents and small numbers of people suggest that artificial sweeteners can affect the healthful gut microbes that help us digest food. This in turn can alter the body\u2019s ability to use glucose, which might then lead to weight gain. But until larger studies are done in people, the long-term impact of these sweeteners on gut microbes and weight remains uncertain. \u201cThere\u2019s much controversy about the health effects of artificial sweeteners and the differences between sugars and sweeteners,\u201d says Dr. Ivan de Araujo of Yale University. \u201cSome animal studies indicate that sweeteners can produce physiological effects. But depending on what kind of measurement is taken, including in humans, the outcomes may be conflicting.\u201d De Araujo and others have been studying the effects that sugars and low-calorie sweeteners might have on the brain. His animal studies found that sugar and sweeteners tap differently into the brain\u2019s reward circuitry, with sugars having a more powerful and pleasurable effect. \u201cThe part of the brain that mediates the \u2018I can\u2019t stop\u2019 kinds of behaviors seems to be especially sensitive to sugars and largely insensitive to artificial sweeteners,\u201d de Araujo says. \u201cOur long-term goal is really to understand if sugars or caloric sweeteners drive persistent intake of food. If exposed to too much sugar, does the brain eventually change in ways that lead to excess consumption? That\u2019s what we\u2019d like to know.\u201d Some research suggests that the intensely sweet taste of artificial, low-calorie sweeteners can lead to a \u201csweet tooth,\u201d or a preference for sweet things. This in turn might lead to overeating. But more studies are needed to confirm the relative effects of caloric vs. non-caloric sweeteners. \u201cIn the long run, if you want to lose weight, you need to establish a healthy lifestyle that contains unprocessed foods, moderate calories, and more exercise,\u201d Rother says. When kids grow up eating a lot of sweet foods, they tend to develop a preference for sweets. But if you give them a variety of healthy foods like fruits and vegetables early in life, they\u2019ll develop a liking for them too. \u201cIt\u2019s important for parents to expose children to a variety of tastes early on, but realize that it often takes several attempts to get a child to eat such foods,\u201d says Bremer. \u201cDon\u2019t give up too soon.\u201d The key to good health is eating a well-balanced diet with a variety of foods and getting plenty of physical activity.

But after that short burst of sweetness, you may worry about how sweets affect your waistline and your overall health. Is sugar really bad for us? How about artificial or low-calorie sweeteners? What have scientists learned about the sweet things that most of us eat and drink every day? Our bodies need one type of sugar, called glucose A type of sugar used by the body for energy. When blood glucose levels get too high, it can damage tissues and organs over time. , to survive. \u201cGlucose is the number one food for the brain, and it\u2019s an extremely important source of fuel throughout the body,\u201d says Dr. Kristina Rother, an NIH pediatrician and expert on sweeteners. But there\u2019s no need to add glucose to your diet, because your body can make the glucose it needs by breaking down food molecules like carbohydrates A class of food molecule that includes sugars, starches, and fibers. , proteins, and fats. Some sugars are found naturally in foods, such as fruits, vegetables, and milk. \u201cThese are healthful additions to your diet,\u201d says Dr. Andrew Bremer, a pediatrician and NIH expert on sweeteners. \u201cWhen you eat an orange, for instance, you\u2019re getting a lot of nutrients and dietary fiber along with the natural sugars.\u201d Although sugar itself isn\u2019t bad, says Rother, \u201csugar has a bad reputation that\u2019s mostly deserved because we consume too much of it. It\u2019s now in just about every food we eat.\u201d Experts agree that Americans eat and drink way too much sugar, and it\u2019s contributing to the obesity epidemic. Much of the sugar we eat isn\u2019t found naturally in food but is added during processing or preparation. About 15% of the calories in the American adult diet come from added sugars. That\u2019s about 22 teaspoons of added sugar a day. Sugars are usually added to make foods and drinks taste better. But such foods can be high in calories and offer none of the healthful benefits of fruits and other naturally sweet foods. Sugar-sweetened beverages like soda, energy drinks, and sports drinks are the leading source of added sugars in the American diet. Juices naturally contain a lot of sugar. But sometimes, even more is added to make them taste sweeter. \u201cJuices offer some vitamins and other nutrients, but I think those benefits are greatly offset by the harmful effects of too much sugar,\u201d says Bremer. Over time, excess sweeteners can take a toll on your health. \u201cSeveral studies have found a direct link between excess sugar consumption and obesity and cardiovascular problems worldwide,\u201d Bremer says. Because of these harmful effects, many health organizations recommend that Americans cut back on added sugars. But added sugars can be hard to identify. On a list of ingredients, they may be listed as sucrose (table sugar), corn sweetener, high-fructose corn syrup, fruit-juice concentrates, nectars, raw sugar, malt syrup, maple syrup, fructose sweeteners, liquid fructose, honey, molasses, anhydrous dextrose, or other words ending in \u201c- ose,\u201d the chemical suffix for sugars. If any of these words are among the first few ingredients on a food label, the food is likely high in sugar. The total amount of sugar in a food is listed under \u201cTotal Carbohydrate\u201d on the Nutrition Facts label. Many people try cutting back on calories by switching from sugar-sweetened to diet foods and drinks that contain low- or no-calorie sweeteners. These artificial sweeteners\u2014also known as sugar substitutes\u2014are many times sweeter than table sugar, so smaller amounts are needed to create the same level of sweetness. People have debated the safety of artificial sweeteners for decades. To date, researchers have found no clear evidence that any artificial sweeteners approved for use in the U.S. cause cancer or other serious health problems in humans. But can they help with weight loss? Scientific evidence is mixed. Some studies suggest that diet drinks can help you drop pounds in the short term, but weight tends to creep back up over time. Rother and other NIH-funded researchers are now working to better understand the complex effects that artificial sweeteners can have on the human body. Studies of rodents and small numbers of people suggest that artificial sweeteners can affect the healthful gut microbes that help us digest food. This in turn can alter the body\u2019s ability to use glucose, which might then lead to weight gain. But until larger studies are done in people, the long-term impact of these sweeteners on gut microbes and weight remains uncertain. \u201cThere\u2019s much controversy about the health effects of artificial sweeteners and the differences between sugars and sweeteners,\u201d says Dr. Ivan de Araujo of Yale University. \u201cSome animal studies indicate that sweeteners can produce physiological effects.

    "content": "\nThe respiratory system (also respiratory apparatus, ventilatory system) is a biological system consisting of specific organs and structures used for gas exchange in animals and plants. The anatomy and physiology that make this happen varies greatly, depending on the size of the organism, the environment in which it lives and its evolutionary history. In land animals, the respiratory surface is internalized as linings of the lungs. Gas exchange in the lungs occurs in millions of small air sacs; in mammals and reptiles, these are called alveoli, and in birds, they are known as atria. These microscopic air sacs have a very rich blood supply, thus bringing the air into close contact with the blood. These air sacs communicate with the external environment via a system of airways, or hollow tubes, of which the largest is the trachea, which branches in the middle of the chest into the two main bronchi. These enter the lungs where they branch into progressively narrower secondary and tertiary bronchi that branch into numerous smaller tubes, the bronchioles. In birds, the bronchioles are termed parabronchi. It is the bronchioles, or parabronchi that generally open into the microscopic alveoli in mammals and atria in birds. Air has to be pumped from the environment into the alveoli or atria by the process of breathing which involves the muscles of respiration.\nIn most fish, and a number of other aquatic animals (both vertebrates and invertebrates), the respiratory system consists of gills, which are either partially or completely external organs, bathed in the watery environment. This water flows over the gills by a variety of active or passive means. Gas exchange takes place in the gills which consist of thin or very flat filaments and lammellae which expose a very large surface area of highly vascularized tissue to the water.\nOther animals, such as insects, have respiratory systems with very simple anatomical features, and in amphibians, even the skin plays a vital role in gas exchange. Plants also have respiratory systems but the directionality of gas exchange can be opposite to that in animals. The respiratory system in plants includes anatomical features such as stomata, that are found in various parts of the plant.\n\nMammals\nAnatomy\n\nMain articles: Lung and Respiratory tract\nFig. 1.

The lower respiratory tract, or \"Respiratory Tree\"TracheaMainstem bronchusLobar bronchusSegmental bronchusBronchioleAlveolar ductAlveolus\nIn humans and other mammals, the anatomy of a typical respiratory system is the respiratory tract. The tract is divided into an upper and a lower respiratory tract. The upper tract includes the nose, nasal cavities, sinuses, pharynx and the part of the larynx above the vocal folds. The lower tract (Fig.\u00a02.) includes the lower part of the larynx, the trachea, bronchi, bronchioles and the alveoli.\nThe branching airways of the lower tract are often described as the respiratory tree or tracheobronchial tree (Fig.\u00a02). The intervals between successive branch points along the various branches of \"tree\" are often referred to as branching \"generations\", of which there are, in the adult human, about 23. The earlier generations (approximately generations 0\u201316), consisting of the trachea and the bronchi, as well as the larger bronchioles which simply act as air conduits, bringing air to the respiratory bronchioles, alveolar ducts and alveoli (approximately generations 17\u201323), where gas exchange takes place. Bronchioles  are defined as the small airways lacking any cartilaginous support.\nThe first bronchi to branch from the trachea are the right and left main bronchi. Second, only in diameter to the trachea (1.8\u00a0cm), these bronchi (1 -1.4\u00a0cm in diameter) enter the lungs at each hilum, where they branch into narrower secondary bronchi known as lobar bronchi, and these branch into narrower tertiary bronchi known as segmental bronchi. Further divisions of the segmental bronchi (1 to 6\u00a0mm in diameter) are known as 4th order, 5th order, and 6th order segmental bronchi, or grouped together as subsegmental bronchi.\nCompared to the 23 number (on average) of branchings of the respiratory tree in the adult human, the mouse has only about 13 such branchings.\nThe alveoli are the dead end terminals of the \"tree\", meaning that any air that enters them has to exit via the same route. A system such as this creates dead space, a volume of air (about 150\u00a0ml in the adult human) that fills the airways after exhalation and is breathed back into the alveoli before environmental air reaches them. At the end of inhalation, the airways are filled with environmental air, which is exhaled without coming in contact with the gas exchanger.\nVentilatory volumes\nFig. 3 Output of a 'spirometer'. Upward movement of the graph, read from the left, indicates the intake of air; downward movements represent exhalation.\n\nMain articles: Breathing and Lung volumes\nThe lungs expand and contract during the breathing cycle, drawing air in and out of the lungs. The volume of air moved in or out of the lungs under normal resting circumstances (the resting tidal volume of about 500\u00a0ml), and volumes moved during maximally forced inhalation and maximally forced exhalation are measured in humans by spirometry. A typical adult human spirogram with the names given to the various excursions in volume the lungs can undergo is illustrated below (Fig.\u00a03):\nNot all the air in the lungs can be expelled during maximally forced exhalation(ERV). This is the residual volume(volume of air remaining even after a forced exhalation) of about 1.0-1.5\u00a0liters which cannot be measured by spirometry. Volumes that include the residual volume (i.e. functional residual capacity of about 2.5-3.0\u00a0liters, and total lung capacity of about 6\u00a0liters) can therefore also not be measured by spirometry. Their measurement requires special techniques.\nThe rates at which air is breathed in or out, either through the mouth or nose or into or out of the alveoli are tabulated below, together with how they are calculated. The number of breath cycles per minute is known as the respiratory rate. An average healthy human breathes 12-16 times a minute.\nMeasurement\nEquation\nDescription\n\n\nMinute ventilation\ntidal volume * respiratory rate\nthe total volume of air entering, or leaving, the nose or mouth per minute or normal respiration.\n\n\nAlveolar ventilation\n(tidal volume \u2013 dead space) * respiratory rate\nthe volume of air entering or leaving the alveoli per minute.\n\n\nDead space ventilation\ndead space * respiratory rate\nthe volume of air that does not reach the alveoli during inhalation, but instead remains in the airways, per minute.\nMechanics of breathing\nFig. 6 Real-time magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the chest movements of human thorax during breathing\n\nMain article: Breathing \u00a7\u00a0Mechanics\nThe \"pump handle\" and \"bucket handle movements\" of the ribsFig. 4 The effect of the muscles of inhalation in expanding the rib cage. The particular action illustrated here is called the pump handle movement of the rib cage.Fig. 5 In this view of the rib cage the downward slope of the lower ribs from the midline outwards can be clearly seen. This allows a movement similar to the \"pump handle effect\", but in this case, it is called the bucket handle movement. The color of the ribs refers to their classification, and is not relevant here.\n\nBreathingFig. 7 The muscles of breathing at rest: inhalation on the left, exhalation on the right. Contracting muscles are shown in red; relaxed muscles in blue. Contraction of the diaphragm generally contributes the most to the expansion of the chest cavity (light blue). However, at the same time, the intercostal muscles pull the ribs upwards (their effect is indicated by arrows) also causing the rib cage to expand during inhalation (see diagram on other side of the page). The relaxation of all these muscles during exhalation causes the rib cage and abdomen (light green) to elastically return to their resting positions. Compare with Fig. 6, the MRI video of the chest movements during the breathing cycle.Fig. 8 The muscles of forceful breathing (inhalation and exhalation). The color code is the same as on the left. In addition to a more forceful and extensive contraction of the diaphragm, the intercostal muscles are aided by the accessory muscles of inhalation to exaggerate the movement of the ribs upwards, causing a greater expansion of the rib cage. During exhalation, apart from the relaxation of the muscles of inhalation, the abdominal muscles actively contract to pull the lower edges of the rib cage downwards decreasing the volume of the rib cage, while at the same time pushing the diaphragm upwards deep into the thorax.\nIn mammals, inhalation at rest is primarily due to the contraction of the diaphragm. This is an upwardly domed sheet of muscle that separates the thoracic cavity from the abdominal cavity. When it contracts, the sheet flattens, (i.e. moves downwards as shown in Fig.\u00a07) increasing the volume of the thoracic cavity in the antero-posterior axis. The contracting diaphragm pushes the abdominal organs downwards. But because the pelvic floor prevents the lowermost abdominal organs from moving in that direction, the pliable abdominal contents cause the belly to bulge outwards to the front and sides, because the relaxed abdominal muscles do not resist this movement (Fig.\u00a07). This entirely passive bulging (and shrinking during exhalation) of the abdomen during normal breathing is sometimes referred to as \"abdominal breathing\", although it is, in fact, \"diaphragmatic breathing\", which is not visible on the outside of the body. Mammals only use their abdominal muscles during forceful exhalation (see Fig.\u00a08, and discussion below). Never during any form of inhalation.\nAs the diaphragm contracts, the rib cage is simultaneously enlarged by the ribs being pulled upwards by the intercostal muscles as shown in Fig.\u00a04. All the ribs slant downwards from the rear to the front (as shown in Fig.\u00a04); but the lowermost ribs also slant downwards from the midline outwards (Fig.\u00a05). Thus the rib cage's transverse diameter can be increased in the same way as the antero-posterior diameter is increased by the so-called pump handle movement shown in Fig.\u00a04.\nThe enlargement of the thoracic cavity's vertical dimension by the contraction of the diaphragm, and its two horizontal dimensions by the lifting of the front and sides of the ribs, causes the intrathoracic pressure to fall. The lungs' interiors are open to the outside air and being elastic, therefore expand to fill the increased space, pleura fluid between double-layered pleura covering of lungs helps in reducing friction while lungs expansion and contraction. The inflow of air into the lungs occurs via the respiratory airways (Fig. 2). In a healthy person, these airways begin with the nose. (It is possible to begin with the mouth, which is the backup breathing system. However, chronic mouth breathing leads to, or is a sign of, illness.) It ends in the microscopic dead-end sacs called alveoli, which are always open, though the diameters of the various sections can be changed by the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. The alveolar air pressure is therefore always close to atmospheric air pressure (about 100\u00a0kPa at sea level) at rest, with the pressure gradients because of lungs contraction and expansion cause air to move in and out of the lungs during breathing rarely exceeding 2\u20133\u00a0kPa.\nDuring exhalation, the diaphragm and intercostal muscles relax. This returns the chest and abdomen to a position determined by their anatomical elasticity. This is the \"resting mid-position\" of the thorax and abdomen (Fig.\u00a07) when the lungs contain their functional residual capacity of air (the light blue area in the right hand illustration of Fig.\u00a07), which in the adult human has a volume of about 2.5\u20133.0\u00a0liters (Fig.\u00a03). Resting exhalation lasts about twice as long as inhalation because the diaphragm relaxes passively more gently than it contracts actively during inhalation.\nFig. 9 The changes in the composition of the alveolar air during a normal breathing cycle at rest. The scale on the left, and the blue line, indicate the partial pressures of carbon dioxide in kPa, while that on the right and the red line, indicate the partial pressures of oxygen, also in kPa (to convert kPa into mm Hg, multiply by 7.5).\nThe volume of air that moves in or out (at the nose or mouth) during a single breathing cycle is called the tidal volume. In a resting adult human, it is about 500\u00a0ml per breath. At the end of exhalation, the airways contain about 150\u00a0ml of alveolar air which is the first air that is breathed back into the alveoli during inhalation. This volume air that is breathed out of the alveoli and back in again is known as dead space ventilation, which has the consequence that of the 500\u00a0ml breathed into the alveoli with each breath only 350\u00a0ml (500\u00a0ml - 150\u00a0ml = 350\u00a0ml) is fresh warm and moistened air. Since this 350\u00a0ml of fresh air is thoroughly mixed and diluted by the air that remains in the alveoli after a normal exhalation (i.e. the functional residual capacity of about 2.5\u20133.0\u00a0liters), it is clear that the composition of the alveolar air changes very little during the breathing cycle (see Fig. 9). The oxygen tension (or partial pressure) remains close to 13-14\u00a0kPa (about 100\u00a0mm\u00a0Hg), and that of carbon dioxide very close to 5.3\u00a0kPa (or 40\u00a0mm\u00a0Hg). This contrasts with composition of the dry outside air at sea level, where the partial pressure of oxygen is 21\u00a0kPa (or 160\u00a0mm\u00a0Hg) and that of carbon dioxide 0.04\u00a0kPa (or 0.3\u00a0mmHg).\nDuring heavy breathing (hyperpnea), as, for instance, during exercise, inhalation is brought about by a more powerful and greater excursion of the contracting diaphragm than at rest (Fig. 8). In addition, the \"accessory muscles of inhalation\" exaggerate the actions of the intercostal muscles (Fig. 8). These accessory muscles of inhalation are muscles that extend from the cervical vertebrae and base of the skull to the upper ribs and sternum, sometimes through an intermediary attachment to the clavicles. When they contract, the rib cage's internal volume is increased to a far greater extent than can be achieved by contraction of the intercostal muscles alone. Seen from outside the body, the lifting of the clavicles during strenuous or labored inhalation is sometimes called clavicular breathing, seen especially during asthma attacks and in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.\nDuring heavy breathing, exhalation is caused by relaxation of all the muscles of inhalation. But now, the abdominal muscles, instead of remaining relaxed (as they do at rest), contract forcibly pulling the lower edges of the rib cage downwards (front and sides) (Fig.\u00a08). This not only drastically decreases the size of the rib cage, but also pushes the abdominal organs upwards against the diaphragm which consequently bulges deeply into the thorax (Fig.\u00a08). The end-exhalatory lung volume is now well below the resting mid-position and contains far less air than the resting \"functional residual capacity\". However, in a normal mammal, the lungs cannot be emptied completely. In an adult human, there is always still at least 1 liter of residual air left in the lungs after maximum exhalation.\nThe automatic rhythmical breathing in and out, can be interrupted by coughing, sneezing (forms of very forceful exhalation), by the expression of a wide range of emotions (laughing, sighing, crying out in pain, exasperated intakes of breath) and by such voluntary acts as speech, singing, whistling and the playing of wind instruments. All of these actions rely on the muscles described above, and their effects on the movement of air in and out of the lungs.\nAlthough not a form of breathing, the Valsalva maneuver involves the respiratory muscles. It is, in fact, a very forceful exhalatory effort against a tightly closed glottis, so that no air can escape from the lungs. Instead, abdominal contents are evacuated in the opposite direction, through orifices in the pelvic floor.  The abdominal muscles contract very powerfully, causing the pressure inside the abdomen and thorax to rise to extremely high levels. The Valsalva maneuver can be carried out voluntarily but is more generally a reflex elicited when attempting to empty the abdomen during, for instance, difficult defecation, or during childbirth. Breathing ceases during this maneuver.\nGas exchange\n\nMain article: Gas exchange\n\nMechanism of gas exchangeFig. 11 A highly diagrammatic illustration of the process of gas exchange in the mammalian lungs, emphasizing the differences between the gas compositions of the ambient air, the alveolar air (light blue) with which the pulmonary capillary blood equilibrates, and the blood gas tensions in the pulmonary arterial (blue blood entering the lung on the left) and venous blood (red blood leaving the lung on the right). All the gas tensions are in kPa. To convert to mm Hg, multiply by 7.5.Fig. 12 A diagrammatic histological cross-section through a portion of lung tissue showing a normally inflated alveolus (at the end of a normal exhalation), and its walls containing the pulmonary capillaries (shown in cross-section). This illustrates how the pulmonary capillary blood is completely surrounded by alveolar air. In a normal human lung, all the alveoli together contain about 3 liters of alveolar air. All the pulmonary capillaries contain about 100 ml of blood.\nFig. 10 A histological cross-section through an alveolar wall showing the layers through which the gases have to move between the blood plasma and the alveolar air. The dark blue objects are the nuclei of the capillary endothelial and alveolar type\u00a0I\u00a0epithelial cells (or type\u00a01\u00a0pneumocytes). The two red objects labeled \"RBC\" are red blood cells in the pulmonary capillary blood.\nThe primary purpose of the respiratory system is the equalizing of the partial pressures of the respiratory gases in the alveolar air with those in the pulmonary capillary blood (Fig. 11). This process occurs by simple diffusion, across a very thin membrane (known as the blood\u2013air barrier), which forms the walls of the pulmonary alveoli (Fig.\u00a010). It consists of the alveolar epithelial cells, their basement membranes and the endothelial cells of the alveolar capillaries (Fig.\u00a010). This blood gas barrier is extremely thin (in humans, on average, 2.2\u00a0\u03bcm thick). It is folded into about 300 million small air sacs called alveoli (each between 75 and 300\u00a0\u00b5m in diameter) branching off from the respiratory bronchioles in the lungs, thus providing an extremely large surface area (approximately 145\u00a0m) for gas exchange to occur.\nThe air contained within the alveoli has a semi-permanent volume of about 2.5-3.0\u00a0liters which completely surrounds the alveolar capillary blood (Fig.\u00a012). This ensures that equilibration of the partial pressures of the gases in the two compartments is very efficient and occurs very quickly. The blood leaving the alveolar capillaries and is eventually distributed throughout the body therefore has a partial pressure of oxygen of 13-14\u00a0kPa (100\u00a0mmHg), and a partial pressure of carbon dioxide of 5.3\u00a0kPa (40\u00a0mmHg) (i.e. the same as the oxygen and carbon dioxide gas tensions as in the alveoli). As mentioned in the section above, the corresponding partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the ambient (dry) air at sea level are 21\u00a0kPa (160\u00a0mmHg) and 0.04\u00a0kPa (0.3\u00a0mmHg) respectively.\nThis marked difference between the composition of the alveolar air and that of the ambient air can be maintained because the functional residual capacity is contained in dead-end sacs connected to the outside air by fairly narrow and relatively long tubes (the airways: nose, pharynx, larynx, trachea, bronchi and their branches down to the bronchioles), through which the air has to be breathed both in and out (i.e. there is no unidirectional through-flow as there is in the bird lung). This typical mammalian anatomy combined with the fact that the lungs are not emptied and re-inflated with each breath (leaving a substantial volume of air, of about 2.5-3.0\u00a0liters, in the alveoli after exhalation), ensures that the composition of the alveolar air is only minimally disturbed when the 350\u00a0ml of fresh air is mixed into it with each inhalation. Thus the animal is provided with a very special \"portable atmosphere\", whose composition differs significantly from the present-day ambient air. It is this portable atmosphere (the functional residual capacity) to which the blood and therefore the body tissues are exposed \u2013 not to the outside air.\nThe resulting arterial partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide are homeostatically controlled. A rise in the arterial partial pressure of CO2 and, to a lesser extent, a fall in the arterial partial pressure of O2, will reflexly cause deeper and faster breathing until the blood gas tensions in the lungs, and therefore the arterial blood, return to normal. The converse happens when the carbon dioxide tension falls, or, again to a lesser extent, the oxygen tension rises: the rate and depth of breathing are reduced until blood gas normality is restored.\nSince the blood arriving in the alveolar capillaries has a partial pressure of O2 of, on average, 6\u00a0kPa (45\u00a0mmHg), while the pressure in the alveolar air is 13-14\u00a0kPa (100\u00a0mmHg), there will be a net diffusion of oxygen into the capillary blood, changing the composition of the 3\u00a0liters of alveolar air slightly. Similarly, since the blood arriving in the alveolar capillaries has a partial pressure of CO2 of also about 6\u00a0kPa (45\u00a0mmHg), whereas that of the alveolar air is 5.3\u00a0kPa (40\u00a0mmHg), there is a net movement of carbon dioxide out of the capillaries into the alveoli. The changes brought about by these net flows of individual gases into and out of the alveolar air necessitate the replacement of about 15% of the alveolar air with ambient air every  5\u00a0seconds or so. This is very tightly controlled by the monitoring of the arterial blood gases (which accurately reflect composition of the alveolar air) by the aortic and carotid bodies, as well as by the blood gas and pH sensor on the anterior surface of the medulla oblongata in the brain. There are also oxygen and carbon dioxide sensors in the lungs, but they primarily determine the diameters of the bronchioles and pulmonary capillaries, and are therefore responsible for directing the flow of air and blood to different parts of the lungs.\nIt is only as a result of accurately maintaining the composition of the 3\u00a0liters of alveolar air that with each breath some carbon dioxide is discharged into the atmosphere and some oxygen is taken up from the outside air. If more carbon dioxide than usual has been lost by a short period of hyperventilation, respiration will be slowed down or halted until the alveolar partial pressure of carbon dioxide has returned to 5.3\u00a0kPa (40\u00a0mmHg). It is therefore strictly speaking untrue that the primary function of the respiratory system is to rid the body of carbon dioxide \u201cwaste\u201d. The carbon dioxide that is breathed out with each breath could probably be more correctly be seen as a byproduct of the body's extracellular fluid carbon dioxide and  pH homeostats\nIf these homeostats are compromised, then a respiratory acidosis, or a respiratory alkalosis will occur. In the long run these can be compensated by renal adjustments to the H and HCO3 concentrations in the plasma; but since this takes time, the hyperventilation syndrome can, for instance, occur when agitation or anxiety cause a person to breathe fast and deeply thus causing a distressing respiratory alkalosis through the blowing off of too much CO2 from the blood into the outside air.\nOxygen has a very low solubility in water, and is therefore carried in the blood loosely combined with hemoglobin. The oxygen is held on the hemoglobin by four ferrous iron-containing heme groups per hemoglobin molecule. When all the heme groups carry one O2 molecule each the blood is said to be \u201csaturated\u201d with oxygen, and no further increase in the partial pressure of oxygen will meaningfully increase the oxygen concentration of the blood. Most of the carbon dioxide in the blood is carried as bicarbonate ions (HCO3) in the plasma. However the conversion of dissolved CO2 into HCO3 (through the addition of water) is too slow for the rate at which the blood circulates through the tissues on the one hand, and through alveolar capillaries on the other. The reaction is therefore catalyzed by carbonic anhydrase, an enzyme inside the red blood cells. The reaction can go in both directions depending on the prevailing partial pressure of CO2. A small amount of carbon dioxide is carried on the protein portion of the hemoglobin molecules as carbamino groups. The total concentration of carbon dioxide (in the form of bicarbonate ions, dissolved CO2, and carbamino groups) in arterial blood (i.e. after it has equilibrated with the alveolar air) is about 26\u00a0mM (or 58\u00a0ml/100 ml), compared to the concentration of oxygen in saturated arterial blood of about 9\u00a0mM (or 20\u00a0ml/100 ml blood).\nControl of ventilation\n\nMain article: Control of ventilation\nVentilation of the lungs in mammals occurs via the respiratory centers in the medulla oblongata and the pons of the brainstem. These areas form a series of neural pathways which receive information about the partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the arterial blood.  This information determines the average rate of ventilation of the alveoli of the lungs, to keep these pressures constant. The respiratory center does so via motor nerves which activate the diaphragm and other muscles of respiration.\nThe breathing rate increases when the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the blood increases. This is detected by central blood gas chemoreceptors on the anterior surface of the medulla oblongata. The aortic and carotid bodies, are the peripheral blood gas chemoreceptors which are particularly sensitive to the arterial partial pressure of O2 though they also respond, but less strongly, to the partial pressure of CO2. At sea level, under normal circumstances, the breathing rate and depth, is determined primarily by the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide rather than by the arterial partial pressure of oxygen, which is allowed to vary within a fairly wide range before the respiratory centers in the medulla oblongata and pons respond to it to change the rate and depth of breathing.\nExercise increases the breathing rate due to the extra carbon dioxide produced by the enhanced metabolism of the exercising muscles. In addition, passive movements of the limbs also reflexively produce an increase in the breathing rate.\nInformation received from stretch receptors in the lungs' limits tidal volume (the depth of inhalation and exhalation).\nResponses to low atmospheric pressures\nThe alveoli are open (via the airways) to the atmosphere, with the result that alveolar air pressure is exactly the same as the ambient air pressure at sea level, at altitude, or in any artificial atmosphere (e.g. a diving chamber, or decompression chamber) in which the individual is breathing freely. With expansion of the lungs the alveolar air occupies a larger volume, and its pressure falls proportionally, causing air to flow in through the airways, until the pressure in the alveoli is again at the ambient air pressure. The reverse happens during exhalation. This process (of inhalation and exhalation) is exactly the same at sea level, as on top of Mt. Everest, or in a diving chamber or decompression chamber.\nFig. 14 A graph showing the relationship between total atmospheric pressure and altitude above sea level.\nHowever, as one rises above sea level the density of the air decreases exponentially (see Fig.\u00a014), halving approximately with every 5500\u00a0m rise in altitude. Since the composition of the atmospheric air is almost constant below 80\u00a0km, as a result of the continuous mixing effect of the weather, the concentration of oxygen in the air (mmols O2 per liter of ambient air) decreases at the same rate as the fall in air pressure with altitude. Therefore, in order to breathe in the same amount of oxygen per minute, the person has to inhale a proportionately greater volume of air per minute at altitude than at sea level. This is achieved by breathing deeper and faster (i.e. hyperpnea) than at sea level (see below).\nFig. 13 Aerial photo of Mount Everest from the south, behind Nuptse and Lhotse.\nThere is, however, a complication that increases the volume of air that needs to be inhaled per minute (respiratory minute volume) to provide the same amount of oxygen to the lungs at altitude as at sea level. During inhalation, the air is warmed and saturated with water vapor during its passage through the nose passages and pharynx. Saturated water vapor pressure is dependent only on temperature. At a body core temperature of 37\u00a0\u00b0C  it is 6.3\u00a0kPa (47.0\u00a0mmHg), irrespective of any other influences, including altitude. Thus at sea level, where the ambient atmospheric pressure is about 100\u00a0kPa, the moistened air that flows into the lungs from the trachea consists of water vapor (6.3\u00a0kPa), nitrogen (74.0\u00a0kPa), oxygen (19.7\u00a0kPa) and trace amounts of carbon dioxide and other gases (a total of 100\u00a0kPa). In dry air the partial pressure of O2 at sea level is 21.0\u00a0kPa (i.e. 21% of 100\u00a0kPa), compared to the 19.7\u00a0kPa of oxygen entering the alveolar air. (The tracheal partial pressure of oxygen is 21% of [100\u00a0kPa \u2013 6.3\u00a0kPa] = 19.7\u00a0kPa).  At the summit of Mt. Everest (at an altitude of 8,848\u00a0m or 29,029\u00a0ft), the total atmospheric pressure is 33.7\u00a0kPa, of which 7.1\u00a0kPa (or 21%) is oxygen. The air entering the lungs also has a total pressure of 33.7\u00a0kPa, of which 6.3\u00a0kPa is, unavoidably, water vapor (as it is at sea level). This reduces the partial pressure of oxygen entering the alveoli to 5.8\u00a0kPa (or 21% of [33.7\u00a0kPa \u2013 6.3\u00a0kPa] = 5.8\u00a0kPa). The reduction in the partial pressure of oxygen in the inhaled air is therefore substantially greater than the reduction of the total atmospheric pressure at altitude would suggest (on Mt Everest: 5.8\u00a0kPa vs. 7.1\u00a0kPa).\nA further minor complication exists at altitude. If the volume of the lungs were to be instantaneously doubled at the beginning of inhalation, the air pressure inside the lungs would be halved. This happens regardless of altitude. Thus, halving of the sea level air pressure (100\u00a0kPa) results in an intrapulmonary air pressure of 50\u00a0kPa. Doing the same at 5500\u00a0m, where the atmospheric pressure is only 50\u00a0kPa,  the intrapulmonary air pressure falls to 25\u00a0kPa. Therefore, the same change in lung volume at sea level results in a 50\u00a0kPa difference in pressure between the ambient air and the intrapulmonary air, whereas it result in a difference of only 25\u00a0kPa at 5500\u00a0m. The driving pressure forcing air into the lungs during inhalation is therefore halved at this altitude. The rate of inflow of air into the lungs during inhalation at sea level is therefore twice that which occurs at 5500\u00a0m. However, in reality, inhalation and exhalation occur far more gently and less abruptly than in the example given. The differences between the atmospheric and intrapulmonary pressures, driving air in and out of the lungs during the breathing cycle, are in the region of only 2\u20133\u00a0kPa. A doubling or more of these small pressure differences could be achieved only by very major changes in the breathing effort at high altitudes.\nAll of the above influences of low atmospheric pressures on breathing are accommodated primarily by breathing deeper and faster (hyperpnea).  The exact degree of hyperpnea is determined by the blood gas homeostat, which regulates the partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the arterial blood. This homeostat prioritizes the regulation of the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide over that of oxygen at sea level. That is to say, at sea level the arterial partial pressure of CO2 is maintained at very close to 5.3\u00a0kPa (or 40\u00a0mmHg) under a wide range of circumstances, at the expense of the arterial partial pressure of O2, which is allowed to vary within a very wide range of values, before eliciting a corrective ventilatory response.  However, when the atmospheric pressure (and therefore the partial pressure of O2 in the ambient air) falls to below 50-75% of its value at sea level, oxygen homeostasis is given priority over carbon dioxide homeostasis. This switch-over occurs at an elevation of about 2500\u00a0m (or about 8000\u00a0ft). If this switch occurs relatively abruptly, the hyperpnea at high altitude will cause a severe fall in the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide, with a consequent rise in the pH of the arterial plasma. This is one contributor to high altitude sickness. On the other hand, if the switch to oxygen homeostasis is incomplete, then hypoxia may complicate the clinical picture with potentially fatal results.\nThere are oxygen sensors in the smaller bronchi and bronchioles. In response to low partial pressures of oxygen in the inhaled air these sensors reflexively cause the pulmonary arterioles to constrict. (This is the exact opposite of the corresponding reflex in the tissues, where low arterial partial pressures of O2 cause arteriolar vasodilation.) At altitude this causes the pulmonary arterial pressure to rise resulting in a much more even distribution of blood flow to the lungs than occurs at sea level. At sea level, the pulmonary arterial pressure is very low, with the result that the tops of the lungs receive far less blood than the bases, which are relatively over-perfused with blood. It is only in the middle of the lungs that the blood and air flow to the alveoli are ideally matched. At altitude, this variation in the ventilation/perfusion ratio of alveoli from the tops of the lungs to the bottoms is eliminated, with all the alveoli perfused and ventilated in more or less the physiologically ideal manner. This is a further important contributor to the acclimatatization to high altitudes and low oxygen pressures.\nThe kidneys measure the oxygen content (mmol\u00a0O2/liter blood, rather than the partial pressure of O2) of the arterial blood. When the oxygen content of the blood is chronically low, as at high altitude, the oxygen-sensitive kidney cells secrete erythropoietin (EPO) into the blood. This hormone stimulates the red bone marrow to increase its rate of red cell production, which leads to an increase in the hematocrit of the blood, and a consequent increase in its oxygen carrying capacity (due to the now high hemoglobin content of the blood). In other words, at the same arterial partial pressure of O2, a person with a high hematocrit carries more oxygen per liter of blood than a person with a lower hematocrit does. High altitude dwellers therefore have higher hematocrits than sea-level residents.\nOther functions of the lungs\nLocal defenses\nIrritation of nerve endings within the nasal passages or airways, can induce a cough reflex and sneezing. These responses cause air to be expelled forcefully from the trachea or nose, respectively. In this manner, irritants caught in the mucus which lines the respiratory tract are expelled or moved to the mouth where they can be swallowed. During coughing, contraction of the smooth muscle in the airway walls narrows the trachea by pulling the ends of the cartilage plates together and by pushing soft tissue into the lumen. This increases the expired airflow rate to dislodge and remove any irritant particle or mucus.\nRespiratory epithelium can secrete a variety of molecules that aid in the defense of the lungs. These include secretory immunoglobulins (IgA), collectins, defensins and other peptides and proteases, reactive oxygen species, and reactive nitrogen species. These secretions can act directly as antimicrobials to help keep the airway free of infection. A variety of chemokines and cytokines are also secreted that recruit the traditional immune cells and others to the site of infections.\nSurfactant immune function is primarily attributed to two proteins: SP-A and SP-D. These proteins can bind to sugars on the surface of pathogens and thereby opsonize them for uptake by phagocytes. It also regulates inflammatory responses and interacts with the adaptive immune response. Surfactant degradation or inactivation may contribute to enhanced susceptibility to lung inflammation and infection.\nMost of the respiratory system is lined with mucous membranes that contain mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue, which produces white blood cells such as lymphocytes.\nPrevention of alveolar collapse\n\nMain article: Pulmonary surfactant\nThe lungs make a surfactant, a surface-active lipoprotein complex (phospholipoprotein) formed by type II alveolar cells. It floats on the surface of the thin watery layer which lines the insides of the alveoli, reducing the water's surface tension.\nThe surface tension of a watery surface (the water-air interface) tends to make that surface shrink. When that surface is curved as it is in the alveoli of the lungs, the shrinkage of the surface decreases the diameter of the alveoli. The more acute the curvature of the water-air interface the greater the tendency for the alveolus to collapse. This has three effects. Firstly, the surface tension inside the alveoli resists expansion of the alveoli during inhalation (i.e. it makes the lung stiff, or non-compliant). Surfactant reduces the surface tension and therefore makes the lungs more compliant, or less stiff, than if it were not there. Secondly, the diameters of the alveoli increase and decrease during the breathing cycle. This means that the alveoli have a greater tendency to collapse (i.e. cause atelectasis) at the end of exhalation than at the end of inhalation. Since surfactant floats on the watery surface, its molecules are more tightly packed together when the alveoli shrink during exhalation. This causes them to have a greater surface tension-lowering effect when the alveoli are small than when they are large (as at the end of inhalation, when the surfactant molecules are more widely spaced). The tendency for the alveoli to collapse is therefore almost the same at the end of exhalation as at the end of inhalation. Thirdly, the surface tension of the curved watery layer lining the alveoli tends to draw water from the lung tissues into the alveoli. Surfactant reduces this danger to negligible levels, and keeps the alveoli dry.\nPre-term babies who are unable to manufacture surfactant have lungs that tend to collapse each time they breathe out. Unless treated, this condition, called respiratory distress syndrome, is fatal. Basic scientific experiments, carried out using cells from chicken lungs, support the potential for using steroids as a means of furthering the development of type II alveolar cells. In fact, once a premature birth is threatened, every effort is made to delay the birth, and a series of steroid injections is frequently administered to the mother during this delay in an effort to promote lung maturation.\nContributions to whole body functions\nThe lung vessels contain a fibrinolytic system that dissolves clots that may have arrived in the pulmonary circulation by embolism, often from the deep veins in the legs. They also release a variety of substances that enter the systemic arterial blood, and they remove other substances from the systemic venous blood that reach them via the pulmonary artery. Some prostaglandins are removed from the circulation, while others are synthesized in the lungs and released into the blood when lung tissue is stretched.\nThe lungs activate one hormone. The physiologically inactive decapeptide angiotensin I is converted to the aldosterone-releasing octapeptide, angiotensin II, in the pulmonary circulation. The reaction occurs in other tissues as well, but it is particularly prominent in the lungs. Angiotensin II also has a direct effect on arteriolar walls, causing arteriolar vasoconstriction, and consequently a rise in arterial blood pressure. Large amounts of the angiotensin-converting enzyme responsible for this activation are located on the surfaces of the endothelial cells of the alveolar capillaries. The converting enzyme also inactivates bradykinin. Circulation time through the alveolar capillaries is less than one second, yet 70% of the angiotensin I reaching the lungs is converted to angiotensin II in a single trip through the capillaries. Four other peptidases have been identified on the surface of the pulmonary endothelial cells.\nVocalization\nThe movement of gas through the larynx, pharynx and mouth allows humans to speak, or phonate. Vocalization, or singing, in birds occurs via the syrinx, an organ located at the base of the trachea. The vibration of air flowing across the larynx (vocal cords), in humans, and the syrinx, in birds, results in sound. Because of this, gas movement is vital for communication purposes.\nTemperature control\nPanting in dogs, cats, birds and some other animals provides a means of reducing body temperature, by evaporating saliva in the mouth (instead of evaporating sweat on the skin).\nClinical significance\nDisorders of the respiratory system can be classified into several general groups:\nAirway obstructive conditions  (e.g., emphysema, bronchitis, asthma)\nPulmonary restrictive conditions  (e.g., fibrosis, sarcoidosis, alveolar damage, pleural effusion)\nVascular diseases  (e.g., pulmonary edema, pulmonary embolism, pulmonary hypertension)\nInfectious, environmental and other \"diseases\" (e.g., pneumonia, tuberculosis, asbestosis, particulate pollutants)\nPrimary cancers (e.g. bronchial carcinoma, mesothelioma)\nSecondary cancers (e.g. cancers that originated elsewhere in the body, but have seeded themselves in the lungs)\nInsufficient surfactant (e.g. respiratory distress syndrome in pre-term babies) .\nDisorders of the respiratory system are usually treated by a pulmonologist and respiratory therapist.\nWhere there is an inability to breathe or insufficiency in breathing, a medical ventilator may be used.\n\nExceptional mammals\nCetaceans\nThis section is an excerpt from Cetacea \u00a7 Respiration.[edit]\nCetaceans have lungs, meaning they breathe air. An individual can last without a breath from a few minutes to over two hours depending on the species. Cetacea are deliberate breathers who must be awake to inhale and exhale. When stale air, warmed from the lungs, is exhaled, it condenses as it meets colder external air. As with a terrestrial mammal breathing out on a cold day, a small cloud of 'steam' appears. This is called the 'spout' and varies across species in shape, angle and height. Species can be identified at a distance using this characteristic.\n\nThe structure of the respiratory and circulatory systems is of particular importance for the life of marine mammals. The oxygen balance is effective. Each breath can replace up to 90% of the total lung volume. For land mammals, in comparison, this value is usually about 15%. During inhalation, about twice as much oxygen is absorbed by the lung tissue as in a land mammal. As with all mammals, the oxygen is stored in the blood and the lungs, but in cetaceans, it is also stored in various tissues, mainly in the muscles. The muscle pigment, myoglobin, provides an effective bond. This additional oxygen storage is vital for deep diving, since beyond a depth around 100\u00a0m (330\u00a0ft), the lung tissue is almost completely compressed by the water pressure.\nHorses\n\nMain article: Respiratory system of the horse\nHorses are obligate nasal breathers which means that they are different from many other mammals because they do not have the option of breathing through their mouths and must take in air through their noses. A flap of tissue called the soft palate blocks off the pharynx from the mouth (oral cavity) of the horse, except when swallowing. This helps to prevent the horse from inhaling food, but does not allow use of the mouth to breathe when in respiratory distress, a horse can only breathe through its nostrils.\nElephants\nThe elephant is the only mammal known to have no pleural space. Instead, the parietal and visceral pleura are both composed of dense connective tissue and joined to each other via loose connective tissue. This lack of a pleural space, along with an unusually thick diaphragm, are thought to be evolutionary adaptations allowing the elephant to remain underwater for long periods while breathing through its trunk which emerges as a snorkel.\nIn the elephant the lungs are attached to the diaphragm and breathing relies mainly on the diaphragm rather than the expansion of the ribcage.\n\nBirds\n\nSee also: Bird anatomy \u00a7\u00a0Respiratory system\nFig. 15 The arrangement of the air sacs, and lungs in birds\nFig. 16 The anatomy of bird's respiratory system, showing the relationships of the trachea, primary and intra-pulmonary bronchi, the dorso- and ventro-bronchi, with the parabronchi running between the two.

Firstly, they have rigid lungs which do not expand and contract during the breathing cycle. Instead an extensive system of air sacs (Fig.\u00a015) distributed throughout their bodies act as the bellows drawing environmental air into the sacs, and expelling the spent air after it has passed through the lungs (Fig.\u00a018). Birds also do not have diaphragms or pleural cavities.\nBird lungs are smaller than those in mammals of comparable size, but the air sacs account for 15% of the total body volume, compared to the 7% devoted to the alveoli which act as the bellows in mammals.\nInhalation and exhalation are brought about by alternately increasing and decreasing the volume of the entire thoraco-abdominal cavity (or coelom) using both their abdominal and costal muscles. During inhalation the muscles attached to the vertebral ribs (Fig.\u00a017) contract angling them forwards and outwards. This pushes the sternal ribs, to which they are attached at almost right angles, downwards and forwards, taking the sternum (with its prominent keel) in the same direction (Fig.\u00a017). This increases both the vertical and transverse diameters of thoracic portion of the trunk. The forward and downward movement of, particularly, the posterior end of the sternum pulls the abdominal wall downwards, increasing the volume of that region of the trunk as well. The increase in volume of the entire trunk cavity reduces the air pressure in all the thoraco-abdominal air sacs, causing them to fill with air as described below.\nDuring exhalation the external oblique muscle which is attached to the sternum and vertebral ribs  anteriorly, and to the pelvis (pubis and ilium in Fig.\u00a017) posteriorly (forming part of the abdominal wall) reverses the inhalatory movement, while compressing the abdominal contents, thus increasing the pressure in all the air sacs. Air is therefore expelled from the respiratory system in the act of exhalation.\nFig. 19 The cross-current respiratory gas exchanger in the lungs of birds. Air is forced from the air sacs unidirectionally (from right to left in the diagram) through the parabronchi. The pulmonary capillaries surround the parabronchi in the manner shown (blood flowing from below the parabronchus to above it in the diagram). Blood or air with a high oxygen content is shown in red; oxygen-poor air or blood is shown in various shades of purple-blue.\nDuring inhalation air enters the trachea via the nostrils and mouth, and continues to just beyond the syrinx at which point the trachea branches into two primary bronchi, going to the two lungs (Fig.\u00a016).  The primary bronchi enter the lungs to become the intrapulmonary bronchi, which give off a set of parallel branches called ventrobronchi and, a little further on, an equivalent set of dorsobronchi (Fig.\u00a016). The ends of the intrapulmonary bronchi discharge air into the posterior air sacs at the caudal end of the bird. Each pair of  dorso-ventrobronchi is connected by a large number of parallel microscopic air capillaries (or parabronchi) where gas exchange occurs (Fig.\u00a016). As the bird inhales, tracheal air flows through the intrapulmonary bronchi into the posterior air sacs, as well as into the dorsobronchi, but not into the ventrobronchi (Fig.\u00a018). This is due to the bronchial architecture which directs the inhaled air away from the openings of the ventrobronchi, into the continuation of the intrapulmonary bronchus towards the dorsobronchi and posterior air sacs. From the dorsobronchi the inhaled air flows through the parabronchi (and therefore the gas exchanger) to the ventrobronchi from where the air can only escape into the expanding anterior air sacs. So, during inhalation, both the posterior and anterior air sacs expand, the posterior air sacs filling with fresh inhaled air, while the anterior air sacs fill with \"spent\" (oxygen-poor) air that has just passed through the lungs.\nFig. 18 Inhalation-exhalation cycle in birds.\nDuring exhalation the pressure in the posterior air sacs (which were filled with fresh air during inhalation) increases due to the contraction of the oblique muscle described above. The aerodynamics of the interconnecting openings from the posterior air sacs to the dorsobronchi and intrapulmonary bronchi ensures that the air leaves these sacs in the direction of the lungs (via the dorsobronchi), rather than returning down the intrapulmonary bronchi (Fig.\u00a018). From the dorsobronchi the fresh air from the posterior air sacs flows through the parabronchi (in the same direction as occurred during inhalation) into ventrobronchi. The air passages connecting the ventrobronchi and anterior air sacs to the intrapulmonary bronchi direct the \"spent\", oxygen poor air from these two organs to the trachea from where it escapes to the exterior. Oxygenated air therefore flows constantly (during the entire breathing cycle) in a single direction through the parabronchi.\nThe blood flow through the bird lung is at right angles to the flow of air through the parabronchi, forming a cross-current flow exchange system (Fig.\u00a019). The partial pressure of oxygen in the parabronchi declines along their lengths as O2 diffuses into the blood. The blood capillaries leaving the exchanger near the entrance of airflow take up more O2 than do the capillaries leaving near the exit end of the parabronchi.  When the contents of all capillaries mix, the final partial pressure of oxygen of the mixed pulmonary venous blood is higher than that of the exhaled air, but is nevertheless less than half that of the inhaled air, thus achieving roughly the same systemic arterial blood partial pressure of oxygen as mammals do with their bellows-type lungs.\nThe trachea is an area of dead space: the oxygen-poor air it contains at the end of exhalation is the first air to re-enter the posterior air sacs and lungs. In comparison to the mammalian respiratory tract, the dead space volume in a bird is, on average, 4.5\u00a0times greater than it is in mammals of the same size. Birds with long necks will inevitably have long tracheae, and must therefore take deeper breaths than mammals do to make allowances for their greater dead space volumes. In some birds (e.g. the whooper swan, Cygnus cygnus, the white spoonbill, Platalea leucorodia, the whooping crane, Grus americana, and the helmeted curassow, Pauxi pauxi) the trachea, which some cranes can be 1.5\u00a0m long, is coiled back and forth within the body, drastically increasing the dead space ventilation. The purpose of this extraordinary feature is unknown.\n\nReptiles\n\nMain article: Reptile \u00a7\u00a0Respiratory system\nFig. 20 X-ray video of a female American alligator while breathing.\nThe anatomical structure of the lungs is less complex in reptiles than in mammals, with reptiles lacking the very extensive airway tree structure found in mammalian lungs. Gas exchange in reptiles still occurs in alveoli however. Reptiles do not possess a diaphragm. Thus, breathing occurs via a change in the volume of the body cavity which is controlled by contraction of intercostal muscles in all reptiles except turtles. In turtles, contraction of specific pairs of flank muscles governs inhalation and exhalation.\n\nAmphibians\n\nMain article: Amphibian \u00a7\u00a0Respiratory system\nBoth the lungs and the skin serve as respiratory organs in amphibians. The ventilation of the lungs in amphibians relies on positive pressure ventilation. Muscles lower the floor of the oral cavity, enlarging it and drawing in air through the nostrils into the oral cavity. With the nostrils and mouth closed, the floor of the oral cavity is then pushed up, which forces air down the trachea into the lungs. The skin of these animals is highly vascularized and moist, with moisture maintained via secretion of mucus from specialised cells, and is involved in cutaneous respiration. While the lungs are of primary organs for gas exchange between the blood and the environmental air (when out of the water), the skin's unique properties aid rapid gas exchange when amphibians are submerged in oxygen-rich water.\nSome amphibians have gills, either in the early stages of their development (e.g. tadpoles of frogs), while others retain them into adulthood (e.g. some salamanders).\n\nFish\n\nMain article: Fish physiology \u00a7\u00a0Respiration\nFig. 21. The operculum or gill cover of a pike has been pulled open to expose the gill arches bearing filaments.\nFig. 22.  A comparison between the operations and effects of a cocurrent and a countercurrent flow exchange system is depicted by the upper and lower diagrams respectively. In both, it is assumed that red has a higher value (e.g. of temperature or the partial pressure of a gas) than blue and that the property being transported in the channels, therefore, flows from red to blue. In fish a countercurrent flow (lower diagram) of blood and water in the gills is used to extract oxygen from the environment.\nFig. 23 The respiratory mechanism in bony fish. The inhalatory process is on the left, the exhalatory process on the right. The movement of water is indicated by the blue arrows.\nOxygen is poorly soluble in water. Fully aerated fresh water therefore contains only 8\u201310\u00a0ml O2/liter compared to the O2 concentration of 210\u00a0ml/liter in the air at sea level. Furthermore, the coefficient of diffusion (i.e. the rate at which a substances diffuses from a region of high concentration to one of low concentration, under standard conditions) of the respiratory gases is typically 10,000 faster in air than in water. Thus oxygen, for instance, has a diffusion coefficient of 17.6\u00a0mm/s in air, but only 0.0021\u00a0mm/s in water. The corresponding values for carbon dioxide are 16\u00a0mm/s in air and 0.0016\u00a0mm/s in water.  This means that when oxygen is taken up from the water in contact with a gas exchanger, it is replaced considerably more slowly by the oxygen from the oxygen-rich regions small distances away from the exchanger than would have occurred in air. Fish have developed gills deal with these problems. Gills are specialized organs containing filaments, which further divide into lamellae. The lamellae contain a dense thin walled capillary network that exposes a large gas exchange surface area to the very large volumes of water passing over them.\nGills use a countercurrent exchange system that increases the efficiency of oxygen-uptake from the water. Fresh oxygenated water taken in through the mouth is uninterruptedly \"pumped\" through the gills in one direction, while the blood in the lamellae flows in the opposite direction, creating the countercurrent blood and water flow (Fig. 22), on which the fish's survival depends.\nWater is drawn in through the mouth by closing the operculum (gill cover), and enlarging the mouth cavity (Fig. 23). Simultaneously the gill chambers enlarge, producing a lower pressure there than in the mouth causing water to flow over the gills. The mouth cavity then contracts, inducing the closure of the passive oral valves, thereby preventing the back-flow of water from the mouth (Fig. 23). The water in the mouth is, instead, forced over the gills, while the gill chambers contract emptying the water they contain through the opercular openings (Fig. 23). Back-flow into the gill chamber during the inhalatory phase is prevented by a membrane along the ventroposterior border of the operculum (diagram on the left in Fig. 23). Thus the mouth cavity and gill chambers act alternately as suction pump and pressure pump to maintain a steady flow of water over the gills in one direction. Since the blood in the lamellar capillaries flows in the opposite direction to that of the water, the consequent countercurrent flow of blood and water maintains steep concentration gradients for oxygen and carbon dioxide along the entire length of each capillary (lower diagram in Fig.\u00a022). Oxygen is, therefore, able to continually diffuse down its gradient into the blood, and the carbon dioxide down its gradient into the water. Although countercurrent exchange systems theoretically allow an almost complete transfer of a respiratory gas from one side of the exchanger to the other, in fish less than 80% of the oxygen in the water flowing over the gills is generally transferred to the blood.\nIn certain active pelagic sharks, water passes through the mouth and over the gills while they are moving, in a process known as \"ram ventilation\". While at rest, most sharks pump water over their gills, as most bony fish do, to ensure that oxygenated water continues to flow over their gills. But a small number of species have lost the ability to pump water through their gills and must swim without rest. These species are obligate ram ventilators and would presumably asphyxiate if unable to move. Obligate ram ventilation is also true of some pelagic bony fish species.\nThere are a few fish that can obtain oxygen for brief periods of time from air swallowed from above the surface of the water. Thus lungfish possess one or two lungs, and the labyrinth fish have developed a special  \"labyrinth organ\", which characterizes this suborder of fish. The labyrinth organ is a much-folded suprabranchial accessory breathing organ. It is formed by a vascularized expansion of the epibranchial bone of the first gill arch, and is used for respiration in air. This organ allows labyrinth fish to take in oxygen directly from the air, instead of taking it from the water in which they reside through the use of gills. The labyrinth organ helps the oxygen in the inhaled air to be absorbed into the bloodstream. As a result, labyrinth fish can survive for a short period of time out of water, as they can inhale the air around them, provided they stay moist. Labyrinth fish are not born with functional labyrinth organs. The development of the organ is gradual and most juvenile labyrinth fish breathe entirely with their gills and develop the labyrinth organs when they grow older.\n\nInvertebrates\nArthropods\n\nSee also: Spiracle (arthropods)\nSome species of crab use a respiratory organ called a branchiostegal lung. Its gill-like structure increases the surface area for gas exchange which is more suited to taking oxygen from the air than from water. Some of the smallest spiders and mites can breathe simply by exchanging gas through the surface of the body. Larger spiders, scorpions and other arthropods use a primitive book lung.\nInsects\n\nMain article: Respiratory system of insects\nMost insects breath passively through their spiracles (special openings in the exoskeleton) and the air reaches every part of the body by means of a series of smaller and smaller tubes called 'trachaea' when their diameters are relatively large, and 'tracheoles' when their diameters are very small. The tracheoles make contact with individual cells throughout the body. They are partially filled with fluid, which can be withdrawn from the individual tracheoles when the tissues, such as muscles,  are active and have a high demand for oxygen, bringing the air closer to the active cells. This is probably brought about by the buildup of lactic acid in the active muscles causing an osmotic gradient, moving the water out of the tracheoles and into the active cells.  Diffusion of gases is effective over small distances but not over larger ones, this is one of the reasons insects are all relatively small. Insects which do not have spiracles and trachaea, such as some Collembola, breathe directly through their skins, also by diffusion of gases.\nThe number of spiracles an insect has is variable between species, however, they always come in pairs, one on each side of the body, and usually one pair per segment. Some of the Diplura have eleven, with four pairs on the thorax, but in most of the ancient forms of insects, such as Dragonflies and Grasshoppers there are two thoracic and eight abdominal spiracles. However, in most of the remaining insects, there are fewer. It is at the level of the tracheoles that oxygen is delivered to the cells for respiration.\nInsects were once believed to exchange gases with the environment continuously by the simple diffusion of gases into the tracheal system. More recently, however, large variation in insect ventilatory patterns has been documented and insect respiration appears to be highly variable. Some small insects do not demonstrate continuous respiratory movements and may lack muscular control of the spiracles. Others, however, utilize muscular contraction of the abdomen along with coordinated spiracle contraction and relaxation to generate cyclical gas exchange patterns and to reduce water loss into the atmosphere. The most extreme form of these patterns is termed discontinuous gas exchange cycles.\nMolluscs\n\nMain article: Respiratory system of gastropods\nMolluscs generally possess gills that allow gas exchange between the aqueous environment and their circulatory systems. These animals also possess a heart that pumps blood containing hemocyanin as its oxygen-capturing molecule. Hence, this respiratory system is similar to that of vertebrate fish. The respiratory system of gastropods can include either gills or a lung.\n\nPlants\n\nMain article: Photosynthesis\nPlants use carbon dioxide gas in the process of photosynthesis, and exhale oxygen gas as waste. The chemical equation of photosynthesis is 6 CO2 (carbon dioxide) and 6 H2O (water), which in the presence of sunlight makes C6H12O6 (glucose) and 6 O2 (oxygen). Photosynthesis uses electrons on the carbon atoms as the repository for the energy obtained from sunlight. Respiration is the opposite of photosynthesis. It reclaims the energy to power chemical reactions in cells. In so doing the carbon atoms and their electrons are combined with oxygen forming CO2 which is easily removed from both the cells and the organism. Plants use both processes, photosynthesis to capture the energy and oxidative metabolism to use it.\nPlant respiration is limited by the process of diffusion. Plants take in carbon dioxide through holes, known as stomata, that can open and close on the undersides of their leaves and sometimes other parts of their anatomy. Most plants require some oxygen for catabolic processes (break-down reactions that release energy). But the quantity of O2 used per hour is small as they are not involved in activities that require high rates of aerobic metabolism. Their requirement for air, however, is very high as they need CO2 for photosynthesis, which constitutes only 0.04% of the environmental air. Thus, to make 1\u00a0g of glucose requires the removal of all the CO2 from at least 18.7\u00a0liters of air at sea level. But inefficiencies in the photosynthetic process cause considerably greater volumes of air to be used.\n\nSee also\nGreat Oxidation Event\u00a0\u2013 Paleoproterozoic surge in atmospheric oxygen\nRespiratory adaptation\u00a0\u2013 Breathing chages caused by exertion\nSpirometry\u00a0\u2013 Pulmonary function test\nPulmonary function testing (PFT)"

Speed breeding manipulates the growing environment by regulating light and temperature for the purpose of rapid generation advance. Protocols are now available for a range of short-day and long-day species and the approach is highly compatible with other cutting-edge breeding tools such as genomic selection. Here, we highlight how speed breeding hijacks biological processes for applied plant breeding outcomes and provide a case study examining wheat growth and development under speed breeding conditions. The establishment of speed breeding facilities worldwide is expected to provide benefits for capacity building, discovery research, pre-breeding, and plant breeding to accelerate the development of productive and robust crops.\n\nIntroduction\nThe year 2050 is fast approaching and we must increase farm productivity by 60% in order to feed a population of 10 billion [1, 2, 3]. To develop the required crop varieties with enhanced yield and climate resilience, the rate of genetic gain in crop breeding programs must be doubled [1, 2, 3]. Technologies that reduce the length of the breeding cycle are critical to help achieve this goal.\n\nA major bottleneck of plant breeding programs is the length of the breeding cycle. In a breeding program focused on line development, once parents have been selected and intermated, 4\u20136 plant generations are required to generate genetically stable homozygous lines for field evaluation. The time taken to identify parents for the next breeding cycle directly impacts the rate of genetic gain and time required to release improved cultivars to farmers. To short-cut this process, plant breeders have adopted different strategies such as doubled haploid technology [4,5] and shuttle breeding [6]. Gaining traction among modern plant breeding programs is \u2018Speed Breeding\u2019 (SB) technology, which involves growing plant populations under environmental conditions that are conducive for early flowering to accelerate generation time [7\u2022,8\u2022\u2022,9,10].\n\nIn this review, we highlight the underlying biological processes that are fundamentally influenced by SB environments and the potential to refine SB protocols. To demonstrate the changes in crop growth and development under SB, we present a case study of wheat. We discuss the opportunities to integrate SB technology with predictive breeding approaches and enhance training capabilities.\n\nSection snippets\nSpeed breeding technology exploits plant processes\nSB manipulates the growing environment by regulating light and temperature [8\u2022\u2022], hijacking biological processes for the purpose of rapid generation advance. Plant growth and development is regulated by many internal and external signals particularly, photoperiod, temperature, light quality and intensity, and planting density [11, 12, 13]. Knowledge of fundamental plant growth and development processes is critical to effectively design and optimize SB protocols for a given species.\n\nIn many\n\nA case study: wheat growth and development under speed breeding conditions\nMany wheat breeding programs have recently established SB facilities to accelerate genetic gain. Typically, these are indoor or glasshouse growth facilities designed to control light and temperature. To highlight changes in growth and development, we studied wheat grown in a controlled SB growth facility (protocol as per Ghosh et al. [7\u2022]) compared to glasshouse conditions. We tracked phenological development and crop growth rate, and used a portable photosynthesis system (LI-6800, LI-COR\n\nOpportunities and challenges in speed breeding techniques\nSB protocols for LDP and DNPs require continuous light or prolonged photoperiods which may result in negative effects such as chlorosis, leaf injury, and limited plant growth and productivity. Deleterious effects on plant growth may be associated with high starch production, photooxidation, and production of stress hormones [30]. Therefore, SB protocols need to be optimized to accelerate development whilst avoiding deleterious effects on plant growth. For example, in spring bread wheat (\n\nEstablishing cost-effective operations and facilities\nStreamlining operations and automating processes (such as water and nutrient delivery), are key to improving efficiencies and reducing costs. SB is a flexible technology and facilities can be designed considering the tradeoffs between the degree of environmental control, the subsequent impact on generation time and economic cost. The cost of running SB facilities may be high especially in areas with extreme winters and/or very hot summers. Energy costs in SB facilities are reported to be\n\nIntegration of speed breeding in a modern plant breeding program\nGenotyping a plant in the 90s was extremely expensive and low throughput. However, the advent of next-generation sequencing technologies helped to revolutionize genotyping for plant breeding applications \u2014 providing genome-wide marker coverage at low cost. This opened the door for genomics-assisted breeding approaches, which are now widely adopted by modern crop improvement programs. Plant breeders can now cost-effectively select for key genes or traits using forward-breeding approaches and\n\nAccelerating research, pre-breeding and training the next generation\nSB technology provides an avenue to support training, discovery research, pre-breeding, and breeding activities of students and early career scientists by reducing the time required to complete plant breeding activities. By implementing SB in their research and training, students are able to gain hands-on experience crossing and developing their own population for quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping or introgression, which is otherwise difficult to achieve within a 3\u20134 year program.\n\nConclusions\nThe concept of integrating SB into a crop improvement program is simple \u2014 \u2018grow plants fast and cheap\u2019. Plant growth and development processes are critical for crop performance and adaptation to changing environments. While SB technology artificially manipulates plant growth environments to accelerate crop breeding and builds on relatively straightforward biological processes, in reality the underlying physiological and genetic mechanisms are complex.

Alternate Nostril Breathing**\n\nThe first technique, alternate nostril breathing, is really simple.\n\nWe\u2019re going to take the ring finger on our right hand, press down on the left\nside of our nostrils, and breathe in with our right nostril. We\u2019re then going\nto take our thumb, close off our our right nostril, and exhale from the left\nnostril.\n\nContinue that for about ten times on the right side: close the left nostril,\ninhale through the right, then close the right, and exhale through the left,\nclose the left, and inhale through the right, close the right, and exhale\nthrough the left.\n\nAnd then we alternate \u2013 you close up the right, inhale through the left, close\nup the left, exhale through the right. You can try this keeping your eyes\nclosed, too. At the end, breathe normally for a few breaths.\n\nAlternate nostril breathing only takes a few minutes, and is a great way to\ngain a little more balance throughout your day.\n\n##  **2\\. Seed Mantra**\n\nMantras are strings of sounds that usually tell a story about some part of the\nuniverse or a Hindu deity. We don\u2019t have to be religious to use mantras \u2013\nthey\u2019re just really calming for the nervous system.\n\nA very simple seed mantra focuses on the throat \u2013 in the chakra system, your\nthroat is associated with the throat chakra. The color is blue, and the sound\n\u2013 or the bija mantra \u2013 that\u2019s associated with the throat is a really simple\n_hum_ .\n\nInhale, _hummmmmm_ , and feel the vibrations in your throat and lips. Do this\nfor eight to ten rounds. And that\u2019s it! That\u2019s the seed mantra, and a great\nway feel calm, too.\n\n##  **3\\. Bumblebee Breath**\n\nThen the next one is kind of a combination of those two, but not really \u2013 it\u2019s\ncalled bumblebee breath.\n\nI love Bumblebee breath, because it\u2019s an opportunity to focus on what\u2019s\nhappening internally \u2013 and also to let all of that kind of calm down.\n\nSo we\u2019re going to use that same sound \u2013 _hummm_ . Super easy, right? Then what\nwe\u2019re gonna add to that, though, is that we\u2019re just going to kind of gently\nclose the eyes, and close off the ears.\n\nSo you\u2019re gonna place your first finger and your second finger on your\nforehead, making a little frame around your \u201cthird eye.\u201d\n\nAnd then your ring finger goes gently over your eyelids, and your pinkies rest\ngently on the tops of your cheeks.\n\nLastly, your thumbs are just gonna plug up your ears, so that you can neither\nsee anything or hear anything.\n\nSo we\u2019re going to close off our ears and our eyes, and then we\u2019re just going\nto add that hum.\n\nSo take a big inhale, and repeat that between five and 10 times.\n\nIf you go out through all of those rounds, or just pick the one that you like,\nyou should see a reduction, and _feel_ a reduction, in your anxiety right\naway.\n\n##  Final note:\n\nThe beauty of breathwork is you can do it anywhere \u2013 whether it\u2019s part of your\nmorning routine, or on an as-needed basis to settle racing, overwhelming\nthoughts.\n\nYou can print these instructions out, bookmark this page, or simply memorize\neach exercise for easy access to a safe, natural way of quelling anxiety.\n\n* * *\n\n[ ![Ruschelle Khanna,\nLCSW](https://assets.zencare.co/2019/02/Ruschelle_Khanna_LCSW.jpg?w=320&q=100)\n](/author/ruschelle-khanna/) [\n\n##  Ruschelle Khanna, LCSW\n\n](/author/ruschelle-khanna/)\n\nRuschelle Khanna is a Licensed Clinical Social Worker in NYC.

    "content": "\nThe Arecaceae (/\u00e6r\u0259\u02c8ke\u026asia\u026a/) is a family of perennial, flowering plants in the monocot order Arecales. Their growth form can be climbers, shrubs, tree-like and stemless plants, all commonly known as palms. Those having a tree-like form are called palm trees. Currently, 181 genera with around 2,600 species are known, most of which are restricted to tropical and subtropical climates. Most palms are distinguished by their large, compound, evergreen leaves, known as fronds, arranged at the top of an unbranched stem, except for the Hyphaene genus, who has branched palms. However, palms exhibit an enormous diversity in physical characteristics and inhabit nearly every type of habitat within their range, from rainforests to deserts.\nPalms are among the best known and most extensively cultivated plant families. They have been important to humans throughout much of history. Many common products and foods are derived from palms. In contemporary times, palms are also widely used in landscaping. In many historical cultures, because of their importance as food, palms were symbols for such ideas as victory, peace, and fertility.\n\nEtymology[edit]\nThe word Arecaceae is derived from the word areca with the suffix \"-aceae\". Areca is derived from Portuguese, via Malayalam \u0d05\u0d1f\u0d2f\u0d4d\u0d15\u0d4d\u0d15 (a\u1e6daykka), which is from Dravidian *a\u1e6d-ay-kk\u0101y (\"areca nut\"). The suffix -aceae is the feminine plural of the Latin -\u0101ceus (\"resembling\").\n\nMorphology[edit]\nWhether as shrubs, tree-like, or vines, palms have two methods of growth: solitary or clustered. The common representation is that of a solitary shoot ending in a crown of leaves. This monopodial character may be exhibited by prostrate, trunkless, and trunk-forming members. Some common palms restricted to solitary growth include Washingtonia and Roystonea. Palms may instead grow in sparse though dense clusters. The trunk develops an axillary bud at a leaf node, usually near the base, from which a new shoot emerges. The new shoot, in turn, produces an axillary bud and a clustering habit results. Exclusively sympodial genera include many of the rattans, Guihaia, and Rhapis. Several palm genera have both solitary and clustering members. Palms which are usually solitary may grow in clusters and vice versa.\nPalms have large, evergreen leaves that are either palmately ('fan-leaved') or pinnately ('feather-leaved') compound and spirally arranged at the top of the stem. The leaves have a tubular sheath at the base that usually splits open on one side at maturity. The inflorescence is a spadix or spike surrounded by one or more bracts or spathes that become woody at maturity. The flowers are generally small and white, radially symmetric, and can be either uni- or bisexual. The sepals and petals usually number three each and may be distinct or joined at the base. The stamens generally number six, with filaments that may be separate, attached to each other, or attached to the pistil at the base. The fruit is usually a single-seeded drupe (sometimes berry-like) but some genera (e.g., Salacca) may contain two or more seeds in each fruit.\nSawn palm stem: Palms do not form annual tree rings.\nLike all monocots, palms do not have the ability to increase the width of a stem (secondary growth) via the same kind of vascular cambium found in non-monocot woody plants. This explains the cylindrical shape of the trunk (almost constant diameter) that is often seen in palms, unlike in ring-forming trees. However, many palms, like some other monocots, do have secondary growth, although because it does not arise from a single vascular cambium producing xylem inwards and phloem outwards, it is often called \"anomalous secondary growth\".\nThe Arecaceae are notable among monocots for their height and for the size of their seeds, leaves, and inflorescences. Ceroxylon quindiuense, Colombia's national tree, is the tallest monocot in the world, reaching up to 60 metres (197\u00a0ft) tall. The coco de mer (Lodoicea maldivica) has the largest seeds of any plant, 40\u201350 centimetres (16\u201320\u00a0in) in diameter and weighing 15\u201330 kilograms (33\u201366\u00a0lb) each (coconuts are the second largest). Raffia palms (Raphia spp.) have the largest leaves of any plant, up to 25 metres (82\u00a0ft) long and 3 metres (10\u00a0ft) wide. The Corypha species have the largest inflorescence of any plant, up to 7.5 metres (25\u00a0ft) tall and containing millions of small flowers. Calamus stems can reach 200 metres (656\u00a0ft) in length.\n\nRange and habitat[edit]\nThis grove of the native species Washingtonia filifera in Palm Canyon, just south of Palm Springs, California, is growing alongside a stream running through the desert.\nMost palms are native to tropical and subtropical climates. Palms thrive in moist and hot climates but can be found in a variety of different habitats. Their diversity is highest in wet, lowland forests. South America, the Caribbean, and areas of the South Pacific and southern Asia are regions of concentration. Colombia may have the highest number of palm species in one country. There are some palms that are also native to desert areas such as the Arabian Peninsula and parts of northwestern Mexico. Only about 130 palm species naturally grow entirely beyond the tropics, mostly in humid lowland subtropical climates, in highlands in southern Asia, and along the rim lands of the Mediterranean Sea. The northernmost native palm is Chamaerops humilis, which reaches 44\u00b0N latitude along the coast of Liguria, Italy. In the southern hemisphere, the southernmost palm is the Rhopalostylis sapida, which reaches 44\u00b0S on the Chatham Islands where an oceanic climate prevails. Cultivation of palms is possible north of subtropical climates, and some higher latitude locales such as Ireland, Scotland, England, and the Pacific Northwest feature a few palms in protected locations and microclimates. In the United States, there are at least 12 native palm species, mostly occurring in the states of the Deep South and Florida.\nPalms inhabit a variety of ecosystems. More than two-thirds of palm species live in humid moist forests, where some species grow tall enough to form part of the canopy and shorter ones form part of the understory. Some species form pure stands in areas with poor drainage or regular flooding, including Raphia hookeri which is common in coastal freshwater swamps in West Africa. Other palms live in tropical mountain habitats above 1\u00a0thousand metres (3\u00a0thousand feet), such as those in the genus Ceroxylon native to the Andes. Palms may also live in grasslands and scrublands, usually associated with a water source, and in desert oases such as the date palm. A few palms are adapted to extremely basic lime soils, while others are similarly adapted to extreme potassium deficiency and toxicity of heavy metals in serpentine soils.\n\nTaxonomy[edit]\nTwo Roystonea regia specimens. The characteristic crownshaft and apex shoot, or 'spear', are visible.\nPalms are a monophyletic group of plants, meaning the group consists of a common ancestor and all its descendants. Extensive taxonomic research on palms began with botanist H.E. Moore, who organized palms into 15 major groups based mostly on general morphological characteristics. The following classification, proposed by N.W. Uhl and J. Dransfield in 1987, is a revision of Moore's classification that organizes palms into 6 subfamilies. A few general traits of each subfamily are listed below.\nSubfamily Arecoideae are the largest subfamily with 14 tribes and containing over 100 genera. All tribes have pinnate or bipinnate leaves and flowers arranged in groups of three, with a central pistillate and two staminate flowers.\nSubfamily Calamoideae includes the climbing palms, such as rattans. The leaves are usually pinnate; derived characters (synapomorphies) include spines on various organs, organs specialized for climbing, an extension of the main stem of the leaf-bearing reflexed spines, and overlapping scales covering the fruit and ovary.\nSubfamily Ceroxyloideae has small to medium-sized flowers, spirally arranged, with a gynoecium of three joined carpels.\nSubfamily Coryphoideae are the second-largest subfamily with 8 tribes. Most palms in this subfamily have palmately lobed leaves and solitary flowers with three, or sometimes four carpels. The fruit normally develops from only one carpel.\nSubfamily Nypoideae contains only one species, Nypa fruticans, which has large, pinnate leaves. The fruit is unusual in that it floats, and the stem is underground and dichotomously branched, also unusual in palms.\nThe Phytelephantoideae is the sixth subfamily of Arecaceae in N.W. Uhl and J. Dransfield's 1987 classification. Members of this group have distinct monopodial flower clusters. Other distinct features include a gynoecium with five to 10 joined carpels, and flowers with more than three parts per whorl. Fruits are multiple-seeded and have multiple parts. From the modern phylogenomic data, the Phytelephantoideae are tribe in the  Ceroxyloideae subfamily.\nCurrently, few extensive phylogenetic studies of the Arecaceae exist. In 1997, Baker et al. explored subfamily and tribe relationships using chloroplast DNA from 60 genera from all subfamilies and tribes. The results strongly showed the Calamoideae are monophyletic, and Ceroxyloideae and Coryphoideae are paraphyletic. The relationships of Arecoideae are uncertain, but they are possibly related to the Ceroxyloideae and Phytelephantoideae. Studies have suggested the lack of a fully resolved hypothesis for the relationships within the family is due to a variety of factors, including difficulties in selecting appropriate outgroups, homoplasy in morphological character states, slow rates of molecular evolution important for the use of standard DNA markers, and character polarization. However, hybridization has been observed among Orbignya and Phoenix species, and using chloroplast DNA in cladistic studies may produce inaccurate results due to maternal inheritance of the chloroplast DNA. Chemical and molecular data from non-organelle DNA, for example, could be more effective for studying palm phylogeny.\nRecently, nuclear genomes and transcriptomes have been used to reconstruct the phylogeny of palms. This has revealed, for example, that a whole-genome duplication event occurred early in the evolution of the Arecaceae lineage, that was not experienced by its sister clade, the Dasypogonaceae.\nFor a phylogenetic tree of the family, see the list of Arecaceae genera.\n\nSelected genera[edit]\n\nMain articles: List of Arecaceae genera by taxonomic groups and List of Arecaceae genera by alphabetical order\nSilhouette of palms in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa\nMultan, Pakistan\nVarious Arecaceae\nYoung Beccariophoenix alfredii\nCuban royal palm\nCrown shaft base of Royal palm\nArchontophoenix\u2014Bangalow palm\nAreca\u2014Betel palm\nAstrocaryum\nAttalea\nBactris\u2014Pupunha\nBeccariophoenix\u2014Beccariophoenix alfredii\nBismarckia\u2014Bismarck palm\nBorassus\u2014Palmyra palm, sugar palm, toddy palm\nButia\nCalamus\u2014Rattan palm\nCeroxylon\nCocos\u2014Coconut\nCoccothrinax\nCopernicia\u2014Carnauba wax palm\nCorypha\u2014Gebang palm, Buri palm or Talipot palm\nElaeis\u2014Oil palm\nEuterpe\u2014Cabbage heart palm, a\u00e7a\u00ed palm\nHyphaene\u2014Doum palm\nJubaea\u2014Chilean wine palm, Coquito palm\nLatania\u2014Latan palm\nLicuala\nLivistona\u2014Cabbage palm\nMauritia\u2014Moriche palm\nMetroxylon\u2014Sago palm\nNypa\u2014Nipa palm\nParajubaea\u2014Bolivian coconut palms\nPhoenix\u2014Date palm\nPritchardia\nRaphia\u2014Raffia palm\nRhapidophyllum\nRhapis\nRoystonea\u2014Royal palm\nSabal\u2014Palmettos\nSalacca\u2014Salak\nSyagrus\u2014Queen palm\nThrinax\nTrachycarpus\u2014Windmill palm, Kumaon palm\nTrithrinax\nVeitchia\u2014Manila palm, Joannis palm\nWashingtonia\u2014Fan palm\n\nEvolution[edit]\nThis section needs additional citations for verification.

(January 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)\nThe Arecaceae were the first modern family of monocots to appear in the fossil record around 80\u00a0million years ago (Mya), during the late Cretaceous period. The first modern species, such as Nypa fruticans and Acrocomia aculeata, appeared 69\u00a0Mya, as evidenced by fossil Nypa pollen. Palms appear to have undergone an early period of adaptive radiation. By 60\u00a0Mya, many of the modern, specialized genera of palms appeared and became widespread and common, much more widespread than their range today. Because palms separated from the monocots earlier than other families, they developed more intrafamilial specialization and diversity. By tracing back these diverse characteristics of palms to the basic structures of monocots, palms may be valuable in studying monocot evolution.  Several species of palms have been identified from flowers preserved in amber, including Palaeoraphe dominicana and Roystonea palaea.  Fossil evidence of them can also be found in samples of petrified palmwood.\nThe relationship between the subfamilies is shown in the following cladogram:\nArecaceae\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCalamoideae\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNypoideae\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoryphoideae\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCeroxyloideae\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArecoideae\n\nUses[edit]\nArecaceae are common in Saudi Arabia\nPalmyra palm fruit at Guntur, India\nHuman use of palms is at least as old as human civilization itself, starting with the cultivation of the date palm by Mesopotamians and other Middle Eastern peoples 5000 years or more ago. Date wood, pits for storing dates, and other remains of the date palm have been found in Mesopotamian sites. The date palm had a tremendous effect on the history of the Middle East. W.H. Barreveld wrote:\nOne could go as far as to say that, had the date palm not existed, the expansion of the human race into the hot and barren parts of the \"old\" world would have been much more restricted. The date palm not only provided a concentrated energy food, which could be easily stored and carried along on long journeys across the deserts, it also created a more amenable habitat for the people to live in by providing shade and protection from the desert winds (Fig. 1). In addition, the date palm also yielded a variety of products for use in agricultural production and for domestic utensils, and practically all parts of the palm had a useful purpose.\nAn indication of the importance of palms in ancient times is that they are mentioned more than 30 times in the Bible, and at least 22 times in the Quran.\nArecaceae have great economic importance, including coconut products, oils, dates, palm syrup, ivory nuts, carnauba wax, rattan cane, raffia, and palm wood. This family supplies a large amount of the human diet and several other human uses, both by absolute amount produced and by number of species domesticated. This is far higher than almost any other plant family, sixth out of domesticated crops in the human diet, and first in total economic value produced \u2013 sharing the top spot with the Poaceae and Fabaceae. These human uses have also spread many Arecaceae species around the world.\nAlong with dates mentioned above, members of the palm family with human uses are numerous.\nThe type member of Arecaceae is the areca palm (Areca catechu), the fruit of which, the areca nut, is chewed with the betel leaf for intoxicating effects.\nCarnauba wax is harvested from the leaves of a Brazilian palm (Copernicia).\nRattans, whose stems are used extensively in furniture and baskets, are in the genus Calamus.\nPalm oil is an edible vegetable oil produced by the oil palms in the genus Elaeis.\nSeveral species are harvested for heart of palm, a vegetable eaten in salads.\nSap of the nipa palm, Nypa fruticans, is used to make vinegar.\nPalm sap is sometimes fermented to produce palm wine or toddy, an alcoholic beverage common in parts of Africa, India, and the Philippines. The sap may be drunk fresh, but fermentation is rapid, reaching up to 4% alcohol content within an hour, and turning vinegary in a day.\nPalmyra and date palm sap is harvested in Bengal, India, to process into gur and jaggery.\nDragon's blood, a red resin used traditionally in medicine, varnish, and dyes, may be obtained from the fruit of Daemonorops species.\nCoconut is the partially edible seed of the fruit of the coconut palm (Cocos nucifera).\nCoir is a coarse, water-resistant fiber extracted from the outer shell of coconuts, used in doormats, brushes, mattresses, and ropes. In India, beekeepers use coir in their bee smokers.\nSome indigenous groups living in palm-rich areas use palms to make many of their necessary items and food. Sago, for example, a starch made from the pith of the trunk of the sago palm Metroxylon sagu, is a major staple food for lowland peoples of New Guinea and the Moluccas. This is not the same plant commonly used as a house plant and called \"sago palm\".\nPalm wine is made from Jubaea also called Chilean wine palm, or coquito palm\nRecently, the fruit of the a\u00e7a\u00ed palm Euterpe  has been used for its reputed health benefits.\nSaw palmetto (Serenoa repens) is under investigation as a drug for treating enlarged prostates.\nPalm leaves are also valuable to some peoples as a material for thatching, basketry, clothing, and in religious ceremonies (see \"Symbolism\" below).\nOrnamental uses: Today, palms are valuable as ornamental plants and are often grown along streets in tropical and subtropical cities. Chamaedorea elegans is a popular houseplant and is grown indoors for its low maintenance. Farther north, palms are a common feature in botanical gardens or as indoor plants. Few palms tolerate severe cold and the majority of the species are tropical or subtropical. The three most cold-tolerant species are Trachycarpus fortunei, native to eastern Asia, and Rhapidophyllum hystrix and Sabal minor, both native to the southeastern United States.\nThe southeastern U.S. state of South Carolina is nicknamed the Palmetto State after the sabal palmetto (cabbage palmetto), logs from which were used to build the fort at Fort Moultrie. During the American Revolutionary War, they were invaluable to those defending the fort, because their spongy wood absorbed or deflected the British cannonballs.\nSingaporean politician Tan Cheng Bock uses a palm tree-like symbol similar to a Ravenala to represent him in the 2011 Singaporean presidential election. The symbol of a party he founded, Progress Singapore Party, was also based on a palm tree.\nOn Ash Wednesday, Catholics receive a cross on their forehead made of palm ashes as a reminder of the Catholic belief that everyone and everything eventually returns to where it came from, commonly expressed by the saying \"ashes to ashes and dust to dust\".\nFruit of the date palm Phoenix dactylifera\n\n\n\nWashingtonia robusta palms line Ocean Avenue in Santa Monica, California.\n\n\n\nRodeo Palms, a subdivision in Manvel, Texas\n\n\n\nSabal palm in the Canaveral National Seashore\n\n\n\nCoconut flowers\n\n\n\nClose-up of the top, Atlantic Ocean, Georgia, U.S.\n\nEndangered species[edit]\nPritchardia affinis, a critically endangered species endemic to the Hawaiian Islands\nLike many other plants, palms have been threatened by human intervention and exploitation. The greatest risk to palms is destruction of habitat, especially in the tropical forests, due to urbanization, wood-chipping, mining, and conversion to farmland. Palms rarely reproduce after such great changes in the habitat, and those with small habitat ranges are most vulnerable to them. The harvesting of heart of palm, a delicacy in salads, also poses a threat because it is derived from the palm's apical meristem, a vital part of the palm that cannot be regrown (except in domesticated varieties, e.g. of peach palm). The use of rattan palms in furniture has caused a major population decrease in these species that has negatively affected local and international markets, as well as biodiversity in the area. The sale of seeds to nurseries and collectors is another threat, as the seeds of popular palms are sometimes harvested directly from the wild. In 2006, at least 100 palm species were considered endangered, and nine species have been reported as recently extinct.\nHowever, several factors make palm conservation more difficult. Palms live in almost every type of warm habitat and have tremendous morphological diversity. Most palm seeds lose viability quickly, and they cannot be preserved in low temperatures because the cold kills the embryo. Using botanical gardens for conservation also presents problems, since they can rarely house more than a few plants of any species or truly imitate the natural setting. There is also the risk that cross-pollination can lead to hybrid species.\nThe Palm Specialist Group of the World Conservation Union (IUCN) began in 1984, and has performed a series of three studies to find basic information on the status of palms in the wild, use of wild palms, and palms under cultivation. Two projects on palm conservation and use supported by the World Wildlife Fund took place from 1985 to 1990 and 1986\u20131991, in the American tropics and southeast Asia, respectively. Both studies produced copious new data and publications on palms. Preparation of a global action plan for palm conservation began in 1991, supported by the IUCN, and was published in 1996.\nThe rarest palm known is Hyophorbe amaricaulis. The only living individual remains at the Botanic Gardens of Curepipe in Mauritius.\n\nArthropod pests[edit]\nSome pests are specialists to particular taxa. Pests that attack a variety of species of palms include:\nRaoiella indica, the red palm mite\nCaryobruchus gleditsiae, the palm seed beetle or palm seed weevil\nRhynchophorus ferrugineus, the red palm weevil, recently introduced to Europe\n\nSymbolism[edit]\n\nMain article: Palm branch (symbol)\nEdward Hitchcock's fold-out paleontological chart in his 1840 Elementary Geology, showing the Palms as the crown of the plant tree of life, alongside Man as the crown of the animal tree of life.\nThe palm branch was a symbol of triumph and victory in classical antiquity. The Romans rewarded champions of the games and celebrated military successes with palm branches. Early Christians used the palm branch to symbolize the victory of the faithful over enemies of the soul, as in the Palm Sunday festival celebrating the triumphal entry of Jesus Christ into Jerusalem. In Judaism, the palm represents peace and plenty, and is one of the Four Species of Sukkot; the palm may also symbolize the Tree of Life in Kabbalah.\nThe canopies of the Rathayatra carts which carry the deities of Krishna and his family members in the cart festival of Jagganath Puri in India are marked with the emblem of a palm tree. Specifically it is the symbol of Krishna's brother, Baladeva.\nIn 1840, the American geologist Edward Hitchcock (1793\u20131864) published the first tree-like paleontology chart in his Elementary Geology, with two separate trees of life for the plants and the animals. These are crowned (graphically) with the Palms and with Man.\nToday, the palm, especially the coconut palm, remains a symbol of the tropical island paradise.\nPalms appear on the flags and seals of several places where they are native, including those of Haiti, Guam, Saudi Arabia, Florida, and South Carolina.\nPalm trees on farm blown by wind.\n\nOther plants[edit]\nSome species commonly called palms, though they are not true palms, include:\nAilanthus altissima (Ghetto palm), a tree in the flowering plant family Simaroubaceae\nAlocasia odora x gageana 'Calidora' (Persian palm), a flowering plant in the family Araceae\nAloe thraskii (Palm aloe), a flowering plant in the family Asphodelaceae\nAmorphophallus konjac (Snake palm), a flowering plant in the family Araceae\nBeaucarnea recurvata (Ponytail palm), a flowering plant in the family Asparagaceae\nBegonia luxurians (Palm leaf begonia), a flowering plant in the family Begoniaceae\nBiophytum umbraculum (South Pacific palm), a flowering plant in the family Oxalidaceae\nBlechnum appendiculatum (Palm fern), a fern  in the family Aspleniaceae\nBrassica oleracea 'Lacinato kale' (Black Tuscan palm), a flowering plant in the family Brassicaceae\nBrighamia insignis (Vulcan palm), a flowering plant in the family Campanulaceae\nCarludovica palmata (Panama hat palm) and perhaps other members in the family Cyclanthaceae.\nCordyline australis (Cabbage palm, Torbay palm, ti palm) or palm lily (family Asparagaceae) and other representatives in the genus Cordyline.\nCyathea cunninghamii (Palm fern) and other tree ferns (families Cyatheaceae and Dicksoniaceae) that may be confused with palms.\nCycas revoluta (Sago palm) and the rest of the order Cycadales.\nCyperus alternifolius (Umbrella palm), a sedge in the family Cyperaceae\nDasylirion longissimum (Grass palm), a flowering plant in the family Asparagaceae and other plants in the genus Dasylirion\nDioon spinulosum (Gum palm), a cycad in the family Zamiaceae\nDracaena marginata (Dragon palm) a flowering plant in the family Asparagaceae\nEisenia arborea (Southern sea palm), a species of brown alga in the family Lessoniaceae\nFatsia japonica (Figleaf palm), a flowering plant in the family Araliaceae\nHypnodendron comosum (Palm tree moss or palm moss), a moss in the family Hypnodendraceae\nMusa species (Banana palm), a flowering plant in the family Musaceae\nPachypodium lamerei (Madagascar palm), a flowering plant in the family Apocynaceae\nPandanus spiralis (Screw palm), a flowering plant in the family Pandanaceae and perhaps other Pandanus spp.\nRavenala (Traveller's palm), a flowering plant in the family Strelitziaceae\nSetaria palmifolia (Palm grass), a grass in the family Poaceae\nYucca brevifolia (Yucca palm or palm tree yucca)\nYucca filamentosa (Needle palm) and Yucca filifera (St. Peter's palm), flowering plants in the family Asparagaceae\nZamia furfuracea (Cardboard palm), a cycad in the family Zamiaceae\nZamioculcas zamiifolia (Emerald palm or aroid palm), a flowering plant in the family Araceae\n\nSee also[edit]\nCoconut\nFan palm\u2014genera with palmate leaves\nList of Arecaceae genera\nList of foliage plant diseases (Arecaceae)\nList of hardy palms\u2014palms able to withstand colder temperatures\nPostelsia\u2014called the \"sea palm\" (a brown alga)"

In plants, parthenogenesis is a component process of apomixis. In algae, parthenogenesis can mean the development of an embryo from either an individual sperm or an individual egg.\nParthenogenesis occurs naturally in some plants, algae, invertebrate animal species (including nematodes, some tardigrades, water fleas, some scorpions, aphids, some mites, some bees, some Phasmatodea, and parasitic wasps), and a few vertebrates (such as some fish, amphibians, reptiles,\nand birds).\nThis type of reproduction has been induced artificially in a number of animal species that naturally reproduce through sex, including fish, amphibians, and mice.\nNormal egg cells form in the process of meiosis and are haploid, with half as many chromosomes as their mother's body cells. Haploid individuals, however, are usually non-viable, and parthenogenetic offspring usually have the diploid chromosome number. Depending on the mechanism involved in restoring the diploid number of chromosomes, parthenogenetic offspring may have anywhere between all and half of the mother's alleles. In some types of parthenogenesis the offspring having all of the mother's genetic material are called full clones and those having only half are called half clones. Full clones are usually formed without meiosis. If meiosis occurs, the offspring will get only a fraction of the mother's alleles since crossing over of DNA takes place during meiosis, creating variation.\nParthenogenetic offspring in species that use either the XY or the X0 sex-determination system have two X chromosomes and are female. In species that use the ZW sex-determination system, they have either two Z chromosomes (male) or two W chromosomes (mostly non-viable but rarely a female), or they could have one Z and one W chromosome (female).\nParthenogenesis does not apply to isogamous species.\n\nLife history types[edit]\n\nFurther information: Origin and function of meiosis\nA young Komodo dragon, Varanus komodoensis, produced through parthenogenesis. Komodo dragons are an example of a species which can produce offspring both through sexual reproduction and parthenogenesis.\nSome species reproduce exclusively by parthenogenesis (such as the bdelloid rotifers), while others can switch between sexual reproduction and parthenogenesis. This is called facultative parthenogenesis (other terms are cyclical parthenogenesis, heterogamy or heterogony).\nThe switch between sexuality and parthenogenesis in such species may be triggered by the season (aphid, some gall wasps), or by a lack of males or by conditions that favour rapid population growth (rotifers and cladocerans like Daphnia). In these species asexual reproduction occurs either in summer (aphids) or as long as conditions are favourable. This is because in asexual reproduction a successful genotype can spread quickly without being modified by sex or wasting resources on male offspring who will not give birth. Some species can produce both sexually and through parthenogenesis, and offspring in the same clutch of a species of tropical lizard can be a mix of sexually produced offspring and parthenogenically produced offspring.\nIn California Condors facultative parthenogenesis can occur even when a male is present and available for a female to breed with.\nIn times of stress, offspring produced by sexual reproduction may be fitter as they have new, possibly beneficial gene combinations. In addition, sexual reproduction provides the benefit of meiotic recombination between non-sister chromosomes, a process associated with repair of DNA double-strand breaks and other DNA damages that may be induced by stressful conditions.\nMany taxa with heterogony have within them species that have lost the sexual phase and are now completely asexual. Many other cases of obligate parthenogenesis (or gynogenesis) are found among polyploids and hybrids where the chromosomes cannot pair for meiosis.\nThe production of female offspring by parthenogenesis is referred to as thelytoky (e.g., aphids) while the production of males by parthenogenesis is referred to as arrhenotoky (e.g., bees). When unfertilized eggs develop into both males and females, the phenomenon is called deuterotoky.\n\nTypes and mechanisms[edit]\nParthenogenesis can occur without meiosis through mitotic oogenesis. This is called apomictic parthenogenesis. Mature egg cells are produced by mitotic divisions, and these cells directly develop into embryos. In flowering plants, cells of the gametophyte can undergo this process. The offspring produced by apomictic parthenogenesis are full clones of their mother. Examples include aphids.\nParthenogenesis involving meiosis is more complicated. In some cases, the offspring are haploid (e.g., male ants). In other cases, collectively called automictic parthenogenesis, the ploidy is restored to diploidy by various means. This is because haploid individuals are not viable in most species. In automictic parthenogenesis, the offspring differ from one another and from their mother. They are called half clones of their mother.\nAutomictic [edit]\nThe effects of central fusion and terminal fusion on heterozygosity\nAutomixis is a term that covers several reproductive mechanisms, some of which are parthenogenetic.\nDiploidy might be restored by the doubling of the chromosomes without cell division before meiosis begins or after meiosis is completed. This is referred to as an endomitotic cycle. This may also happen by the fusion of the first two blastomeres. Other species restore their ploidy by the fusion of the meiotic products. The chromosomes may not separate at one of the two anaphases (called restitutional meiosis) or the nuclei produced may fuse or one of the polar bodies may fuse with the egg cell at some stage during its maturation.\nSome authors consider all forms of automixis sexual as they involve recombination. Many others classify the endomitotic variants as asexual and consider the resulting embryos parthenogenetic. Among these authors, the threshold for classifying automixis as a sexual process depends on when the products of anaphase I or of anaphase II are joined. The criterion for \"sexuality\" varies from all cases of restitutional meiosis, to those where the nuclei fuse or to only those where gametes are mature at the time of fusion. Those cases of automixis that are classified as sexual reproduction are compared to self-fertilization in their mechanism and consequences.\nThe genetic composition of the offspring depends on what type of automixis takes place. When endomitosis occurs before meiosis or when central fusion occurs (restitutional meiosis of anaphase I or the fusion of its products), the offspring get all to more than half of the mother's genetic material and heterozygosity is mostly preserved (if the mother has two alleles for a locus, it is likely that the offspring will get both). This is because in anaphase I the homologous chromosomes are separated. Heterozygosity is not completely preserved when crossing over occurs in central fusion. In the case of pre-meiotic doubling, recombination, if it happens, occurs between identical sister chromatids.\nIf terminal fusion (restitutional meiosis of anaphase II or the fusion of its products) occurs, a little over half the mother's genetic material is present in the offspring and the offspring are mostly homozygous. This is because at anaphase II the sister chromatids are separated and whatever heterozygosity is present is due to crossing over. In the case of endomitosis after meiosis, the offspring is completely homozygous and has only half the mother's genetic material.\nThis can result in parthenogenetic offspring being unique from each other and from their mother.\nSex of the offspring[edit]\nIn apomictic parthenogenesis, the offspring are clones of the mother and hence (except for aphids) are usually female. In the case of aphids, parthenogenetically produced males and females are clones of their mother except that the males lack one of the X chromosomes (XO).\nWhen meiosis is involved, the sex of the offspring will depend on the type of sex determination system and the type of apomixis. In species that use the XY sex-determination system, parthenogenetic offspring will have two X chromosomes and are female. In species that use the ZW sex-determination system the offspring genotype may be one of ZW (female), ZZ (male), or WW (non-viable in most species, but a fertile, viable female in a few, e.g., boas). ZW offspring are produced by endoreplication before meiosis or by central fusion. ZZ and WW offspring occur either by terminal fusion or by endomitosis in the egg cell.\nIn polyploid obligate parthenogens, like the whiptail lizard, all the offspring are female.\nIn many hymenopteran insects such as honeybees, female eggs are produced sexually, using sperm from a drone father, while the production of further drones (males) depends on the queen (and occasionally workers) producing unfertilized eggs. This means that females (workers and queens) are always diploid, while males (drones) are always haploid, and produced parthenogenetically.\nFacultative[edit]\nFacultative parthenogenesis is the term for when a female can produce offspring either sexually or via asexual reproduction. Facultative parthenogenesis is extremely rare in nature, with only a few examples of animal taxa capable of facultative parthenogenesis. One of the best-known examples of taxa exhibiting facultative parthenogenesis are mayflies; presumably, this is the default reproductive mode of all species in this insect order. Facultative parthenogenesis has generally been believed to be a response to a lack of a viable male. A female may undergo facultative parthenogenesis if a male is absent from the habitat or if it is unable to produce viable offspring. However, California condors and the tropical lizard Lepidophyma smithii both can produce parthenogenic offspring in the presence of males, indicating that facultative parthenogenesis may be more common than previously thought and is not simply a response to a lack of males.\nIn aphids, a generation sexually conceived by a male and a female produces only females. The reason for this is the non-random segregation of the sex chromosomess 'X' and 'O' during spermatogenesis.\nFacultative parthenogenesis is often used to describe cases of spontaneous parthenogenesis in normally sexual animals.\nFor example, many cases of spontaneous parthenogenesis in sharks, some snakes, Komodo dragons, and a variety of domesticated birds were widely attributed to facultative parthenogenesis.\nThese cases are examples of spontaneous parthenogenesis. The occurrence of such asexually produced eggs in sexual animals can be explained by a meiotic error, leading to eggs produced via automixis.\nObligate[edit]\nObligate parthenogenesis is the process in which organisms exclusively reproduce through asexual means.\nMany species have been shown to transition to obligate parthenogenesis over evolutionary time. Well documented transitions to obligate parthenogenesis have been found in numerous metazoan taxa, albeit through highly diverse mechanisms. These transitions often occur as a result of inbreeding or mutation within large populations.\nThere are a number of documented species, specifically salamanders and geckos, that rely on obligate parthenogenesis as their major method of reproduction. As such, there are over 80 species of unisex reptiles (mostly lizards but including a single snake species), amphibians and fishes in nature for which males are no longer a part of the reproductive process.\nA female will produce an ovum with a full set (two sets of genes) provided solely by the mother. Thus, a male is not needed to provide sperm to fertilize the egg. This form of asexual reproduction is thought in some cases to be a serious threat to biodiversity for the subsequent lack of gene variation and potentially decreased fitness of the offspring.\nSome invertebrate species that feature (partial) sexual reproduction in their native range are found to reproduce solely by parthenogenesis in areas to which they have been introduced.\nRelying solely on parthenogenetic reproduction has several advantages for an invasive species: it obviates the need for individuals in a very sparse initial population to search for mates; and an exclusively female sex distribution allows a population to multiply and invade more rapidly (potentially twice as fast). Examples include several aphid species and the willow sawfly, Nematus oligospilus, which is sexual in its native Holarctic habitat but parthenogenetic where it has been introduced into the Southern Hemisphere.\n\nNatural occurrence[edit]\nParthenogenesis is seen to occur naturally in aphids, Daphnia, rotifers, nematodes, and some other invertebrates, as well as in many plants. Among vertebrates, strict parthenogenesis is only known to occur in lizards, snakes,\nbirds,\nand sharks,\nwith fish, amphibians, and reptiles exhibiting various forms of gynogenesis and hybridogenesis (an incomplete form of parthenogenesis).\nThe first all-female (unisexual) reproduction in vertebrates was described in the fish Poecilia formosa in 1932.\nSince then at least 50 species of unisexual vertebrate have been described, including at least 20 fish, 25 lizards, a single snake species, frogs, and salamanders. Other usually sexual species may occasionally reproduce parthenogenetically; the Komodo dragon and hammerhead and blacktip sharks are recent additions to the known list of spontaneous parthenogenetic vertebrates. As with all types of asexual reproduction, there are both costs (low genetic diversity and therefore susceptibility to adverse mutations that might occur) and benefits (reproduction without the need for a male) associated with parthenogenesis.\nParthenogenesis is distinct from artificial animal cloning, a process where the new organism is necessarily genetically identical to the cell donor. In cloning, the nucleus of a diploid cell from a donor organism is inserted into an enucleated egg cell and the cell is then stimulated to undergo continued mitosis, resulting in an organism that is genetically identical to the donor. Parthenogenesis is different, in that it originates from the genetic material contained within an egg cell and the new organism is not necessarily genetically identical to the parent.\nParthenogenesis may be achieved through an artificial process as described below under the discussion of mammals.\nOomycetes[edit]\nApomixis can apparently occur in Phytophthora, an oomycete. Oospores from an experimental cross were germinated, and some of the progeny were genetically identical to one or other parent, implying that meiosis did not occur and the oospores developed by parthenogenesis.\nVelvet worms[edit]\nNo males of Epiperipatus imthurni have been found, and specimens from Trinidad were shown to reproduce parthenogenetically. This species is the only known velvet worm to reproduce via parthenogenesis.\nRotifers[edit]\nIn bdelloid rotifers, females reproduce exclusively by parthenogenesis (obligate parthenogenesis), while in monogonont rotifers, females can alternate between sexual and asexual reproduction (cyclical parthenogenesis). At least in one normally cyclical parthenogenetic species obligate parthenogenesis can be inherited: a recessive allele leads to loss of sexual reproduction in homozygous offspring.\nFlatworms[edit]\nAt least two species in the genus Dugesia, flatworms in the Turbellaria sub-division of the phylum Platyhelminthes, include polyploid individuals that reproduce by parthenogenesis. This type of parthenogenesis requires mating, but the sperm does not contribute to the genetics of the offspring (the parthenogenesis is pseudogamous, alternatively referred to as gynogenetic). A complex cycle of matings between diploid sexual and polyploid parthenogenetic individuals produces new parthenogenetic lines.\nSnails[edit]\nSeveral species of parthenogenetic gastropods have been studied, especially with respect to their status as invasive species. Such species include the New Zealand mud snail (Potamopyrgus antipodarum), the red-rimmed melania (Melanoides tuberculata), and the Quilted melania (Tarebia granifera).\nInsects[edit]\nParthenogenesis in insects can cover a wide range of mechanisms. The offspring produced by parthenogenesis may be of both sexes, only female (thelytoky, e.g. aphids and some hymenopterans) or only male (arrhenotoky, e.g. most hymenopterans). Both true parthenogenesis and pseudogamy (gynogenesis or sperm-dependent parthenogenesis) are known to occur. The egg cells, depending on the species may be produced without meiosis (apomictically) or by one of the several automictic mechanisms.\nA related phenomenon, polyembryony is a process that produces multiple clonal offspring from a single egg cell. This is known in some hymenopteran parasitoids and in Strepsiptera.\nIn automictic species the offspring can be haploid or diploid. Diploids are produced by doubling or fusion of gametes after meiosis. Fusion is seen in the Phasmatodea, Hemiptera (Aleurodids and Coccidae), Diptera, and some Hymenoptera.\nIn addition to these forms is hermaphroditism, where both the eggs and sperm are produced by the same individual, but is not a type of parthenogenesis. This is seen in three species of Icerya scale insects.\nParasitic bacteria like Wolbachia have been noted to induce automictic thelytoky in many insect species with haplodiploid systems. They also cause gamete duplication in unfertilized eggs causing them to develop into female offspring.\nHoney bee on a plum blossom\nAmong species with the haplo-diploid sex-determination system, such as hymenopterans (ants, bees, and wasps) and thysanopterans (thrips), haploid males are produced from unfertilized eggs. Usually, eggs are laid only by the queen, but the unmated workers may also lay haploid, male eggs either regularly (e.g. stingless bees) or under special circumstances. An example of non-viable parthenogenesis is common among domesticated honey bees. The queen bee is the only fertile female in the hive; if she dies without the possibility of a viable replacement queen, it is not uncommon for the worker bees to lay eggs. This is a result of the lack of the queen's pheromones and the pheromones secreted by uncapped brood, which normally suppress ovarian development in workers. Worker bees are unable to mate, and the unfertilized eggs produce only drones (males), which can mate only with a queen. Thus, in a relatively short period, all the worker bees die off, and the new drones follow if they have not been able to mate before the collapse of the colony. This behavior is believed to have evolved to allow a doomed colony to produce drones which may mate with a virgin queen and thus preserve the colony's genetic progeny.\nA few ants and bees are capable of producing diploid female offspring parthenogenetically. These include a honey bee subspecies from South Africa, Apis mellifera capensis, where workers are capable of producing diploid eggs parthenogenetically, and replacing the queen if she dies; other examples include some species of small carpenter bee, (genus Ceratina). Many parasitic wasps are known to be parthenogenetic, sometimes due to infections by Wolbachia.\nThe workers in five ant species and the queens in some ants are known to reproduce by parthenogenesis. In Cataglyphis cursor, a European formicine ant, the queens and workers can produce new queens by parthenogenesis. The workers are produced sexually.\nIn Central and South American electric ants, Wasmannia auropunctata, queens produce more queens through automictic parthenogenesis with central fusion. Sterile workers usually are produced from eggs fertilized by males. In some of the eggs fertilized by males, however, the fertilization can cause the female genetic material to be ablated from the zygote. In this way, males pass on only their genes to become fertile male offspring. This is the first recognized example of an animal species where both females and males can reproduce clonally resulting in a complete separation of male and female gene pools. As a consequence, the males will only have fathers and the queens only mothers, while the sterile workers are the only ones with both parents of both sexes.\nThese ants get both the benefits of both asexual and sexual reproduction\u2014the daughters who can reproduce (the queens) have all of the mother's genes, while the sterile workers whose physical strength and disease resistance are important are produced sexually.\nOther examples of insect parthenogenesis can be found in gall-forming aphids (e.g., Pemphigus betae), where females reproduce parthenogenetically during the gall-forming phase of their life cycle and in grass thrips. In the grass thrips genus Aptinothrips there have been, despite the very limited number of species in the genus, several transitions to asexuality.\nCrustaceans[edit]\nCrustacean reproduction varies both across and within species. The water flea Daphnia pulex alternates between sexual and parthenogenetic reproduction. Among the better-known large decapod crustaceans, some crayfish reproduce by parthenogenesis. \"Marmorkrebs\" are parthenogenetic crayfish that were discovered in the pet trade in the 1990s.\nOffspring are genetically identical to the parent, indicating it reproduces by apomixis, i.e. parthenogenesis in which the eggs did not undergo meiosis. Spinycheek crayfish (Orconectes limosus) can reproduce both sexually and by parthenogenesis.\nThe Louisiana red swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii), which normally reproduces sexually, has also been suggested to reproduce by parthenogenesis,\nalthough no individuals of this species have been reared this way in the lab. Artemia parthenogenetica is a species or series of populations of parthenogenetic brine shrimps.\nSpiders[edit]\nAt least two species of spiders in the family Oonopidae (goblin spiders), Heteroonops spinimanus and Triaeris stenaspis, are thought to be parthenogenetic, as no males have ever been collected. Parthenogenetic reproduction has been demonstrated in the laboratory for T.\u00a0stenaspis.\nSharks[edit]\nParthenogenesis in sharks has been confirmed in at least three species, the bonnethead, the blacktip shark,\nand the zebra shark,\nand reported in others.\nA bonnethead, a type of small hammerhead shark, was found to have produced a pup, born live on December 14, 2001, at Henry Doorly Zoo in Nebraska, in a tank containing three female hammerheads, but no males. The pup was thought to have been conceived through parthenogenesis. The shark pup was apparently killed by a stingray within days of birth. The investigation of the birth was conducted by the research team from Queen's University Belfast, Southeastern University in Florida, and Henry Doorly Zoo itself, and it was concluded after DNA testing that the reproduction was parthenogenetic. The testing showed the female pup's DNA matched only one female who lived in the tank, and that no male DNA was present in the pup. The pup was not a twin or clone of her mother, but rather, contained only half of her mother's DNA (\"automictic parthenogenesis\"). This type of reproduction had been seen before in bony fish, but never in cartilaginous fish such as sharks, until this documentation.\nIn the same year, a female Atlantic blacktip shark in Virginia reproduced via parthenogenesis. On October 10, 2008, scientists confirmed the second case of a \"virgin birth\" in a shark. The Journal of Fish Biology reported a study in which scientists said DNA testing proved that a pup carried by a female Atlantic blacktip shark in the Virginia Aquarium & Marine Science Center contained no genetic material from a male.\nIn 2002, two white-spotted bamboo sharks were born at the Belle Isle Aquarium in Detroit. They hatched 15 weeks after being laid. The births baffled experts as the mother shared an aquarium with only one other shark, which was female. The female bamboo sharks had laid eggs in the past. This is not unexpected, as many animals will lay eggs even if there is not a male to fertilize them. Normally, the eggs are assumed to be inviable and are discarded. This batch of eggs was left undisturbed by the curator as he had heard about the previous birth in 2001 in Nebraska and wanted to observe whether they would hatch. Other possibilities had been considered for the birth of the Detroit bamboo sharks including thoughts that the sharks had been fertilized by a male and stored the sperm for a period of time, as well as the possibility that the Belle Isle bamboo shark is a hermaphrodite, harboring both male and female sex organs, and capable of fertilizing its own eggs, but that is not confirmed.\nIn 2008, a Hungarian aquarium had another case of parthenogenesis after its lone female shark produced a pup without ever having come into contact with a male shark.\nThe repercussions of parthenogenesis in sharks, which fails to increase the genetic diversity of the offspring, is a matter of concern for shark experts, taking into consideration conservation management strategies for this species, particularly in areas where there may be a shortage of males due to fishing or environmental pressures. Although parthenogenesis may help females who cannot find mates, it does reduce genetic diversity.\nIn 2011, recurring shark parthenogenesis over several years was demonstrated in a captive zebra shark, a type of carpet shark.\nDNA genotyping demonstrated that individual zebra sharks can switch from sexual to parthenogenetic reproduction.\nRays[edit]\nA female round stingray (Urobatis halleri) held in captivity from all males for eight years was reported pregnant in 2024.\nAmphibians[edit]\n\nMain article: Parthenogenesis in amphibians\nCrocodiles[edit]\nIn June 2023, discovery was made at a zoo in Costa Rica, where researchers identified the first documented case of a self-pregnant crocodile. This female American crocodile, housed at Parque Reptilania, produced a genetically identical foetus, with a 99.9% similarity to herself. The scientists speculate that this unique ability might be inherited from an evolutionary ancestor, suggesting that even dinosaurs could have possessed the capability for self-reproduction. The 18-year-old crocodile laid the egg in January 2018, the fully formed foetus did not hatch and was stillborn. Notably, this crocodile had been kept separated from other crocodiles throughout her entire life since being acquired at the age of two.\nSquamata[edit]\n\nMain article: Parthenogenesis in squamata\nKomodo dragon, Varanus komodoensis, rarely reproduces offspring via parthenogenesis.\nMost reptiles of the squamatan order (lizards and snakes) reproduce sexually, but parthenogenesis has been observed to occur naturally in certain species of whiptails, some geckos, rock lizards,\nKomodo dragons,\nand snakes.\nSome of these like the mourning gecko Lepidodactylus lugubris, Indo-Pacific house gecko Hemidactylus garnotii, the hybrid whiptails Cnemidophorus, Caucasian rock lizards Darevskia, and the brahminy blindsnake, Indotyphlops braminus are unisexual and obligately parthenogenetic. Other reptiles, such as the Komodo dragon, other monitor lizards,\nand some species of boas,\npythons,\nfilesnakes,\ngartersnakes,\nand rattlesnakes\nwere previously considered as cases of facultative parthenogenesis, but may be cases of accidental parthenogenesis.\nIn 2012, facultative parthenogenesis was reported in wild vertebrates for the first time by US researchers amongst captured pregnant copperhead and cottonmouth female pit-vipers.\nThe Komodo dragon, which normally reproduces sexually, has also been found able to reproduce asexually by parthenogenesis.\nA case has been documented of a Komodo dragon reproducing via sexual reproduction after a known parthenogenetic event, highlighting that these cases of parthenogenesis are reproductive accidents, rather than adaptive, facultative parthenogenesis.\nSome reptile species use a ZW chromosome system, which produces either males (ZZ) or females (ZW). Until 2010, it was thought that the ZW chromosome system used by reptiles was incapable of producing viable WW offspring, but a (ZW) female boa constrictor was discovered to have produced viable female offspring with WW chromosomes.\nParthenogenesis has been studied extensively in the New Mexico whiptail in the genus Aspidoscelis of which 15 species reproduce exclusively by parthenogenesis. These lizards live in the dry and sometimes harsh climate of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. All these asexual species appear to have arisen through the hybridization of two or three of the sexual species in the genus leading to polyploid individuals. The mechanism by which the mixing of chromosomes from two or three species can lead to parthenogenetic reproduction is unknown. Recently, a hybrid parthenogenetic whiptail lizard was bred in the laboratory from a cross between an asexual and a sexual whiptail.\nBecause multiple hybridization events can occur, individual parthenogenetic whiptail species can consist of multiple independent asexual lineages. Within lineages, there is very little genetic diversity, but different lineages may have quite different genotypes.\nAn interesting aspect to reproduction in these asexual lizards is that mating behaviors are still seen, although the populations are all female. One female plays the role played by the male in closely related species, and mounts the female that is about to lay eggs. This behaviour is due to the hormonal cycles of the females, which cause them to behave like males shortly after laying eggs, when levels of progesterone are high, and to take the female role in mating before laying eggs, when estrogen dominates. Lizards who act out the courtship ritual have greater fecundity than those kept in isolation, due to the increase in hormones that accompanies the mounting. So, although the populations lack males, they still require sexual behavioral stimuli for maximum reproductive success.\nSome lizard parthenogens show a pattern of geographic parthenogenesis, occupying high mountain areas where their ancestral forms have an inferior competition ability.\nIn Caucasian rock lizards of genus Darevskia, which have six parthenogenetic forms of hybrid origin\nhybrid parthenogenetic form D. \"dahli\" has a broader niche than either of its bisexual ancestors and its expansion throughout the Central Lesser Caucasus caused decline of the ranges of both its maternal and paternal species.\nBirds[edit]\nParthenogenesis in birds is known mainly from studies of domesticated turkeys and chickens, although it has also been noted in the domestic pigeon. In most cases the egg fails to develop normally or completely to hatching.\nThe first description of parthenogenetic development in a passerine was demonstrated in captive zebra finches, although the dividing cells exhibited irregular nuclei and the eggs did not hatch.\nParthenogenesis in turkeys appears to result from a conversion of haploid cells to diploid; most embryos produced in this way die early in development. Rarely, viable birds result from this process, and the rate at which this occurs in turkeys can be increased by selective breeding,\nhowever male turkeys produced from parthenogenesis exhibit smaller testes and reduced fertility.\nIn 2021, the San Diego Zoo reported that they had two unfertilized eggs from their California condor breeding program hatch. This is the first known example of parthenogenesis in this species, as well as one of the only known examples of parthenogenesis happening where males are still present.\nMammals[edit]\nThere are no known cases of naturally occurring mammalian parthenogenesis in the wild. Parthenogenetic progeny of mammals would have two X chromosomes, and would therefore be genetically female.\nIn 1936, Gregory Goodwin Pincus reported successfully inducing parthenogenesis in a rabbit.\nIn April 2004, scientists at Tokyo University of Agriculture used parthenogenesis successfully to create a fatherless mouse. Using gene targeting, they were able to manipulate two imprinted loci H19/IGF2 and DLK1/MEG3 to produce bi-maternal mice at high frequency and subsequently show that fatherless mice have enhanced longevity.\nInduced parthenogenesis in mice and monkeys often results in abnormal development. This is because mammals have imprinted genetic regions, where either the maternal or the paternal chromosome is inactivated in the offspring in order for development to proceed normally. A mammal created by parthenogenesis would have double doses of maternally imprinted genes and lack paternally imprinted genes, leading to developmental abnormalities. It has been suggested\nthat defects in placental folding or interdigitation are one cause of swine parthenote abortive development. As a consequence, research on human parthenogenesis is focused on the production of embryonic stem cells for use in medical treatment, not as a reproductive strategy. In 2022, researchers reported that they have achieved parthenogenesis in mice for viable offspring born from unfertilized eggs, addressing the problems of genomic imprinting by \"targeted DNA methylation rewriting of seven imprinting control regions\".\nMethods[edit]\nThis article may be too technical for most readers to understand. Please help improve it to make it understandable to non-experts, without removing the technical details. (December 2021) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)\nUse of an electrical or chemical stimulus can produce the beginning of the process of parthenogenesis in the asexual development of viable offspring.\nInduction of parthenogenesis in swine. Parthenogenetic development of swine oocytes. High metaphase promoting factor (MPF) activity causes mammalian oocytes to arrest at the metaphase II stage until fertilization by a sperm. The fertilization event causes intracellular calcium oscillations, and targeted degradation of cyclin B, a regulatory subunit of MPF, thus permitting the MII-arrested oocyte to proceed through meiosis. To initiate parthenogenesis of swine oocytes, various methods exist to induce an artificial activation that mimics sperm entry, such as calcium ionophore treatment, microinjection of calcium ions, or electrical stimulation. Treatment with cycloheximide, a non-specific protein synthesis inhibitor, enhances parthenote development in swine presumably by continual inhibition of MPF/cyclin B. As meiosis proceeds, extrusion of the second polar is blocked by exposure to cytochalasin B. This treatment results in a diploid (2 maternal genomes) parthenote. Parthenotes can be surgically transferred to a recipient oviduct for further development, but will succumb by developmental failure after \u224830 days of gestation. The swine parthenote placentae often appears hypo-vascular and is approximately 50% smaller than biparental offspring placentae: see free image (Figure 1) in linked reference.\nDuring oocyte development, high metaphase promoting factor (MPF) activity causes mammalian oocytes to arrest at the metaphase II stage until fertilization by a sperm.

The swine parthenote placentae often appears hypo-vascular: see free image (Figure 1) in linked reference.\nHumans[edit]\nReports of human parthenogenesis have famously existed since ancient times, featuring prominently in\u00a0Christianity and various other religions. More recently, Helen Spurway, a geneticist specializing in the reproductive biology of the guppy (Lebistes reticulatus), claimed in 1955 that parthenogenesis, which occurs in the guppy in nature, may also occur (though very rarely) in the human species, leading to so-called \"virgin births\". This created some sensation among her colleagues and the lay public alike. Sometimes an embryo may begin to divide without fertilisation, but it cannot fully develop on its own; so while it may create some skin and nerve cells, it cannot create others (such as skeletal muscle) and becomes a type of benign tumor called an ovarian teratoma. Spontaneous ovarian activation is not rare and has been known about since the 19th century. Some teratomas can even become primitive fetuses (fetiform teratoma) with imperfect heads, limbs and other structures, but are non-viable.\nIn 1995, there was a reported case of partial human parthenogenesis; a boy was found to have some of his cells (such as white blood cells) to be lacking in any genetic content from his father. Scientists believe that an unfertilised egg began to self-divide but then had some (but not all) of its cells fertilised by a sperm cell; this must have happened early in development, as self-activated eggs quickly lose their ability to be fertilised. The unfertilised cells eventually duplicated their DNA, boosting their chromosomes to 46. When the unfertilised cells hit a developmental block, the fertilised cells took over and developed that tissue. The boy had asymmetrical facial features and learning difficulties but was otherwise healthy. This would make him a parthenogenetic chimera (a child with two cell lineages in his body). While over a dozen similar cases have been reported since then (usually discovered after the patient demonstrated clinical abnormalities), there have been no scientifically confirmed reports of a non-chimeric, clinically healthy human parthenote (i.e. produced from a single, parthenogenetic-activated oocyte).\nOn June 26, 2007, the International Stem Cell Corporation (ISCC), a California-based stem cell research company, announced that their lead scientist, Dr. Elena Revazova, and her research team were the first to intentionally create human stem cells from unfertilized human eggs using parthenogenesis. The process may offer a way for creating stem cells that are genetically matched to a particular female for the treatment of degenerative diseases that might affect her. In December 2007, Dr. Revazova and ISCC published an article illustrating a breakthrough in the use of parthenogenesis to produce human stem cells that are homozygous in the HLA region of DNA. These stem cells are called HLA homozygous parthenogenetic human stem cells (hpSC-Hhom) and have unique characteristics that would allow derivatives of these cells to be implanted into millions of people without immune rejection.\nWith proper selection of oocyte donors according to HLA haplotype, it is possible to generate a bank of cell lines whose tissue derivatives, collectively, could be MHC-matched with a significant number of individuals within the human population.\nOn August 2, 2007, after an independent investigation, it was revealed that discredited South Korean scientist Hwang Woo-Suk unknowingly produced the first human embryos resulting from parthenogenesis. Initially, Hwang claimed he and his team had extracted stem cells from cloned human embryos, a result later found to be fabricated. Further examination of the chromosomes of these cells show indicators of parthenogenesis in those extracted stem cells, similar to those found in the mice created by Tokyo scientists in 2004. Although Hwang deceived the world about being the first to create artificially cloned human embryos, he contributed a major breakthrough to stem cell research by creating human embryos using parthenogenesis. The truth was discovered in 2007, long after the embryos were created by him and his team in February 2004. This made Hwang the first, unknowingly, to successfully perform the process of parthenogenesis to create a human embryo and, ultimately, a human parthenogenetic stem cell line.\n\nSimilar phenomena[edit]\nGynogenesis[edit]\n\nSee also: Gynogenesis and Parthenogenesis in amphibians \u00a7\u00a0Gynogenesis\nA form of asexual reproduction related to parthenogenesis is gynogenesis. Here, offspring are produced by the same mechanism as in parthenogenesis, but with the requirement that the egg merely be stimulated by the presence of sperm in order to develop. However, the sperm cell does not contribute any genetic material to the offspring. Since gynogenetic species are all female, activation of their eggs requires mating with males of a closely related species for the needed stimulus. Some salamanders of the genus Ambystoma are gynogenetic and appear to have been so for over a million years. It is believed that the success of those salamanders may be due to rare fertilization of eggs by males, introducing new material to the gene pool, which may result from perhaps only one mating out of a million. In addition, the amazon molly is known to reproduce by gynogenesis.\nHybridogenesis[edit]\n\nSee also: Hybridogenesis in water frogs\nHybridogenesis is a mode of reproduction of hybrids. Hybridogenetic hybrids (for example AB genome), usually females, during gametogenesis exclude one of parental genomes (A) and produce gametes with unrecombined genome of second parental species (B), instead of containing mixed recombined parental genomes. First genome (A) is restored by fertilization of these gametes with gametes from the first species (AA, sexual host, usually male).\nSo hybridogenesis is not completely asexual, but instead hemiclonal: half of genome is passed to the next generation clonally, unrecombined, intact (B), other half sexually, recombined (A).\nThis process continues, so that each generation is half (or hemi-) clonal on the mother's side and has half new genetic material from the father's side.\nThis form of reproduction is seen in some live-bearing fish of the genus Poeciliopsis as well as in some of the Pelophylax spp. (\"green frogs\" or \"waterfrogs\"):\nP. kl. esculentus (edible frog): P. lessonae \u00d7 P. ridibundus,\nP. kl. grafi (Graf's hybrid frog): P. perezi \u00d7 P. ridibundus\nP. kl. hispanicus (Italian edible frog) \u2013 unknown origin: P. bergeri \u00d7 P. ridibundus or P. kl. esculentus\nand perhaps in P. demarchii.\nExample crosses between pool frog (Pelophylax lessonae), marsh frog (P. ridibundus) and their hybrid \u2013 edible frog (P. kl. esculentus). First one is the primary hybridisation generating hybrid, second one is most widespread type of hybridogenesis.\nOther examples where hybridogenesis is at least one of modes of reproduction include i.e.\nIberian minnow Tropidophoxinellus alburnoides (Squalius pyrenaicus \u00d7 hypothetical ancestor related with Anaecypris hispanica)\nspined loaches Cobitis hankugensis \u00d7 C. longicorpus\nBacillus stick insects B. rossius \u00d7 Bacillus grandii benazzii\n\nSee also[edit]\nCrustaceans portal\nAndrogenesis - a form of quasi-sexual reproduction in which a male is the sole source of the nuclear genetic material in the embryo\nTelescoping generations\nCharles Bonnet\u00a0\u2013 Genevan botanist (1720\u20131793) \u2013 conducted experiments that established what is now termed parthenogenesis in aphids\nJan Dzier\u017con\u00a0\u2013 Polish apiarist (1811\u20131906)Pages displaying short descriptions of redirect targets \u2013 Polish apiarist and a pioneer of parthenogenesis among bees\nJacques Loeb\u00a0\u2013 German-born American physiologist and biologist \u2013 caused the eggs of sea urchins to begin embryonic development without sperm\nMiraculous births\u00a0\u2013 Conceptions and births by miraculous circumstances\nParthenocarpy\u00a0\u2013 Production of seedless fruit without fertilisation \u2013 plants with seedless fruit"

It affects your distance vision \u2014 you can see objects that are near,\nbut you have trouble viewing objects that are farther away like grocery store\naisle markers or road signs. Myopia treatments include glasses, contact lenses\nor surgery.\n\nContents  Arrow Down  Overview  Symptoms and Causes  Diagnosis and Tests\nManagement and Treatment  Prevention  Outlook / Prognosis  Living With\nAdditional Common Questions\n\nContents  Arrow Down  Overview  Symptoms and Causes  Diagnosis and Tests\nManagement and Treatment  Prevention  Outlook / Prognosis  Living With\nAdditional Common Questions\n\n##  Overview\n\nLearn the signs of nearsightedness and what to do about it.\n\n###  What is myopia?\n\nMyopia is the medical name for nearsightedness, which means that you can see\nobjects that are near clearly but have difficulty seeing objects that are\nfarther away. For example, if you\u2019re nearsighted, you may not be able to make\nout highway signs until they\u2019re just a few feet away.\n\nMyopia affects a significant percentage of people. It\u2019s an [ eye\n](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/21823-eyes) focus disorder that\u2019s\nnormally corrected with eyeglasses, contact lenses or surgery.\n\n####  How common is myopia?\n\nMyopia is common. According to one estimate, more than 40% of people in the\nU.S. are nearsighted. This number is rapidly rising, especially among school-\naged children. Eye experts expect this trend to continue in the coming\ndecades.\n\nOne in four parents has a child with some degree of nearsightedness. Some eye\nexperts believe that if your child spends a great deal of time engaged in\n\u201cnear\u201d activities, such as reading or using smartphones and computers, it may\nraise their risk of developing myopia.\n\n####  Are there types of myopia?\n\n[ Eye specialists ](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/8607-eye-\ncare-specialists) divide myopia broadly into simple myopia and pathologic\nmyopia. Pathologic myopia is a newer name for degenerative myopia.\n\nPeople with simple myopia have contact lenses or eyeglasses that help provide\nclear vision, while those with pathologic myopia may not be able to have clear\n[ vision ](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/21204-vision) even\nwith corrective lenses.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.

Eye experts are still unsure of the exact cause of myopia,\nbut believe it to be a mix of hereditary and environmental factors.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that you can inherit the ability to be myopic. If your lifestyle\nproduces just the right conditions, you\u2019ll develop it. For example, if you use\nyour eyes for a lot of close-up work, like reading or working on a computer,\nyou may develop myopia.\n\nMyopia usually appears in childhood. Typically, the condition can worsen in\nearly childhood but tends to level off by the end of teen years.\n\nBecause the light coming into your eyes doesn\u2019t focus correctly, images are\nunclear. Think of it as being a little like a misdirected spotlight. If you\nshine a spotlight on the incorrect place in the distance, you won\u2019t be able to\nsee the correct object clearly.\n\n####  What are the risk factors for myopia?\n\nRisk factors for nearsightedness may include:\n\n* A family history of myopia.\n* Spending a lot of time doing \u201cclose-up\u201d work, like reading or using screens like those on smartphones or computers.\n* Not spending a lot of time outdoors. Certain studies indicate that this may be a factor in developing myopia.\n* Ethnicity. Some groups of people have higher rates of myopia than others.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n###  What are the complications of myopia?\n\nIn most cases, providers can treat nearsightedness with glasses, contact\nlenses or corrective surgery, like LASIK. However, some cases of pathologic\nmyopia can lead to more serious eye conditions, including:\n\n* Cataracts.\n* Glaucoma.\n* Optic neuropathy.\n* Neovascularization.\n* Retinal detachment.\n\nPathologic myopia may make you more vulnerable to other more serious eye\nconditions. These include:\n\n* Developing unwanted blood vessels in your eye ( [ neovascularization ](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/24131-neovascularization-of-the-eye) ).\n* [ Glaucoma ](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/4212-glaucoma) .\n* Myopic optic neuropathy.\n* [ Retinal detachment ](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/10705-retinal-detachment) .\n* [ Cataracts ](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/8589-cataracts-age-related) .\n\nHigh myopia happens when your child\u2019s eyeballs are too long, or their corneas\nare too steep.\n\n##  Diagnosis and Tests\n\n###  How is myopia diagnosed?\n\nAn eye care provider can diagnose myopia using standard [ eye exams\n](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diagnostics/10738-eye-examinations-\nwhat-to-expect) . Providers usually diagnose myopia in childhood, but it can\nalso develop in adults because of visual stress or diabetes.\n\n####  Testing an adult for myopia\n\nYour provider will evaluate how your eyes focus light and measure the power of\nany corrective lenses you may need. First, they\u2019ll test your visual acuity\n(sharpness) by asking you to read letters on an eye chart. Then, they\u2019ll use a\nlighted retinoscope to measure how your retina reflects light.\n\nYour provider may also use a phoropter. A phoropter is an instrument that\nmeasures the amount of your refractive error by placing a series of lenses in\nfront of your eyes. This is how your provider measures the lens strength you\nneed.\n\n####  Testing your child for myopia\n\nYour [ pediatrician\n](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/21716-what-is-a-pediatrician)\nwill check your child\u2019s eyes at each well-child visit. A [ first eye exam\n](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/when-should-your-child-have-a-first-eye-\nexam-2/) should be before age 1, if possible. If your child has no evident eye\nproblems, then schedule a repeat eye exam before kindergarten.\n\nAs myopia runs in families, if your child has family members with vision\nissues, it\u2019s even more important to test their eyes early. If you or your\npediatrician notice any vision issues, your child may be referred to an [\noptometrist\n](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/24219-optometrist) or\npediatric [ ophthalmologist\n](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/22159-ophthalmologist) .\n\nDuring a children\u2019s eye exam, your eye care provider will do a physical\nexamination of your child\u2019s eyes and check for a regular light reflex. For\nchildren between the ages of 3 and 5 years, your provider will also conduct\nvision screenings using eye chart tests, pictures, letters or the \u201ctumbling E\ngame,\u201d also called the \u201cRandom E\u2019s Visual Acuity Test.\u201d\n\nAs your child\u2019s vision continues to change as they grow, continue to make sure\nthey get vision screenings by their pediatrician or eye care provider before\nfirst grade and every two years thereafter. While most schools conduct eye\nscreenings, they\u2019re usually not complete enough to diagnose myopia. Providers\ndiagnose most children when they\u2019re between the ages of 3 and 12.\n\nYour provider may mention categories \u2014 mild, moderate or high myopia. These\nterms refer to the degree of nearsightedness as measured by [ refractive error\n](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/24224-refractive-errors) .\nRefractive errors are issues with the natural shape of your eyes that make\nyour [ vision blurry\n](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/symptoms/24262-blurred-vision) . It\u2019s\npossible to have myopia and another refractive error, like [ astigmatism\n](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/8576-astigmatism) .\n\nAdvertisement\n\n##  Management and Treatment\n\n###  How is myopia treated?\n\nGlasses or contact lenses can correct myopia in children and adults. For\nadults only (with rare exceptions for children), there are several types of\nrefractive surgeries that can also correct myopia.\n\nWith myopia, your prescription for glasses or contact lenses is a negative\nnumber, such as -3.00. The higher the number, the stronger your lenses will\nbe. The prescription helps your eye focus light on your retina, clearing up\nyour distance vision.\n\n* **Eyeglasses:** The most popular way for most people to correct myopia is with [ eyeglasses ](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/8593-eyeglasses) . Depending on the degree of vision correction needed, you\u2019ll wear eyeglasses either daily or only when you need distance vision. You may only need glasses for driving. Some kids with myopia may only need glasses to play ball, watch a movie or view the chalkboard. Some people may need to wear glasses constantly to see clearly. **** A single-vision lens will make distance vision clearer. But people over 40 who have myopia may require a bifocal or [ progressive lens ](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/progressive-lenses) to see clearly both near and far.\n* **Contact lenses:** Some people find that their distance vision is sharper and wider with [ contact lenses ](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/10737-contact-lenses) . A potential downside is they require more care to keep clean. Ask your provider which type might be right for your myopia level and other refractive errors.\n* **Ortho-k or CRT:** Some people with mild myopia may be candidates for temporary corneal refractive contact lenses that you wear to bed to reshape your cornea temporarily, long enough to see for your daily activities.\n* **LASIK** is a laser-assisted in situ keratomileus procedure, the most common surgery to correct nearsightedness. In a [ LASIK ](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/21805-lasik-eye-surgery) procedure, your ophthalmologist uses a laser to cut a flap through the top of your cornea, reshape the inner corneal tissue and then drop the flap back into place.\n* **LASEK** is a laser-assisted subepithelial keratectomy procedure. In a LASEK procedure, your ophthalmologist uses a laser to cut a flap through only the top layer (epithelium) of your cornea, reshape the outer layers, and then close the flap.\n* [ **PRK** ](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/8596-photorefractive-keratectomy-prk-eye-surgery) is short for \u201cphotorefractive keratectomy,\u201d which is a type of laser eye surgery used to correct mild or moderate nearsightedness. It may also correct farsightedness and/or astigmatism. In a PRK procedure, your ophthalmologist cuts off the front surface of your cornea and uses a laser to reshape the surface, which flattens it and allows light rays to focus on your retina. Unlike LASIK, the ophthalmologist doesn\u2019t cut a flap, and your cornea will regrow its top layer in one to two weeks. PRK is better for people with corneas that are thinner or have a rough surface because it disrupts less corneal tissue than a comparable LASIK surgery.\n* **Phakic intraocular lenses:** These are an option for people who have high myopia or whose corneas are too thin for PRK or LASIK. Your provider places phakic intraocular lenses inside of your eye just in front of your natural lens.\n* **Intraocular lens implant:** This allows your ophthalmologist to surgically insert a new lens in your eye, replacing your natural one. This procedure happens before a cataract develops.\n* **Vision therapy:** This is an option if spasms of your focusing muscles cause myopia. You can strengthen the muscles through eye exercises and improve your focus. This treatment isn\u2019t appropriate for everyone with myopia. After an eye exam, your ophthalmologist will let you know if it\u2019s an option for you.\n\nCare at Cleveland Clinic\n\n[ Schedule an Eye Exam ](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/services/annual-eye-\nexams)\n\n[ Find a Doctor and Specialists\n](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/services/annual-eye-exams#featured-provider-\npanel)\n\n[ Make an Appointment ](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/webappointment)\n\n##  Prevention\n\n###  Can myopia be prevented?\n\nYou can\u2019t prevent myopia as it\u2019s a condition that tends to run in families,\nbut you may be able to lower your risk of nearsightedness in some ways.\n\n####  How can I lower my risk of developing myopia?\n\nSome eye experts believe that you may be able to decrease your or your child\u2019s\nrisk of developing myopia by getting enough time outside and limiting the\namount of time spent in front of screens. You may also want to be mindful of\nthe amount of time doing close work like reading or sewing.\n\n##  Outlook / Prognosis\n\n###  What can I expect if I have myopia?\n\nMyopia is a condition that doesn\u2019t go away. Treatments include using glasses\nor contact lenses. You may be able to get surgery to correct your vision.\n\n###  What is the outlook for myopia?\n\nThe outlook for being nearsighted may differ depending on the type of myopia.\n\nUsually, providers can treat simple myopia easily. In rare cases of high\nmyopia or pathologic myopia, your outlook may be different.\n\nHigh myopia usually stops getting worse between the ages of 20 and 30. You\u2019ll\nstill be able to get glasses or contact lenses or you may be able to have\nsurgery.\n\nHigh myopia may lead to pathologic myopia and the possibility of more serious\nsight conditions later in life. These complications can lead to loss of sight.\n\nRegular eye exams are important for everyone but are especially if you have\nhigh myopia or pathologic myopia. You should follow the schedule set out by\nyour eye care provider.\n\n##  Living With\n\n###  How can you prevent myopia from getting worse?\n\nThough there\u2019s no cure for myopia, there are everyday steps you can take that\ncan support your overall eye health. These days, it\u2019s especially important to\nset limits for your children (and yourself) on activities that lead to eye\nstrain.\n\nTry these sight-saving tips:\n\n* Limit time on digital devices.\n* Take screen breaks to stretch your eye muscles.\n* Don\u2019t read or work in dim light.\n* Go outdoors and wear sunglasses when you\u2019re out.\n* Wear protective eye gear for sports/hobbies.\n* [ Stop smoking ](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/8699-quitting-smoking) .\n* Schedule regular eye exams.\n* Ask your provider about atropine eye drops to slow progression.\n* Ask your provider about dual-focus contact lenses to slow progression in kids.\n\n###  Which foods should I eat to keep my eyes as healthy as possible?\n\nEveryone\u2019s eyes rely on nutrients from the foods we eat to maintain vital eye\ntissues and functions. Nutrition is especially essential to your child\u2019s\nvision as their eyes grow and develop. In addition to limiting caffeinated\ncolas and other soft drinks, keep hydrated by drinking enough water.\n\nAlso, try to eat foods that are rich in:\n\n* **Vitamin A.** You need enough of the antioxidant vitamin A in your diet to maintain the surface of your eyes and healthy vision. There are vitamin A-rich sources for every diet preference. Plant-based choices include vegetables like sweet potatoes, leafy green vegetables and carrots. Or choose animal-based foods, such as cheese, oily fish or liver.\n* **Vitamin C.** The best foods for getting a daily dose of vitamin C are fruits and vegetables, including oranges, grapefruit, strawberries and broccoli.\n* **Lutein.** Eat leafy green vegetables to make sure to get enough lutein, which helps your eyes filter harmful blue light that can damage retinas.\n\nYou can supplement your or your child\u2019s diet with a multivitamin if you think\nyou or they aren\u2019t getting enough vitamins and minerals. Remember, though,\nthat your body doesn\u2019t absorb vitamins in pills as well as vitamins that occur\nnaturally in foods. And it\u2019s important to check with your healthcare provider\nbefore starting any supplements.\n\nTaking safe care of your and your family\u2019s vision means regular eye exams, a\ngood eye care routine and a healthy diet. Keeping those healthy habits will\nhelp you all to see a future filled with all the things you love.\n\n###  When should I see a doctor about myopia?\n\nRegular eye exams are important for everyone. It\u2019s especially important to\ncontact an eye care provider if you have any type of change in your vision.\n\nIf you have kids and you notice that they squint a lot or pull things close to\ntheir faces to see them, make an appointment.\n\nIn any case of extreme changes in vision \u2014 like a sudden loss of vision or\nnoticing a significant increase in the number of floaters or flashes of light\nyou see \u2014 get immediate medical help. Some conditions, like retinal\ndetachment, are medical emergencies.\n\n##  Additional Common Questions\n\n###  Does myopia get worse with age?\n\nYes, it can. Especially during growth spurts of the pre-teen and teen years,\nwhen your body grows quickly. At the age of 20, myopia usually levels off. You\ncan also get a myopia diagnosis as an adult. When this happens, it\u2019s usually\ndue to visual stress or a disease like diabetes or cataracts.\n\nYou can experience visual stress by spending too much time doing up-close\nactivities, such as reading or doing computer work. Eye experts believe that\nyour focusing muscles may get stuck in \u201cnear gear\u201d from overusing them this\nway.\n\nIf you\u2019re an adult experiencing sudden nearsightedness, [ floaters\n](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/14209-floaters--flashers)\n(spots that appear in your field of vision), flashes of light or shadows, or a\nsudden loss of sight in one eye, contact an eye care provider immediately to\nrule out a more serious health condition.\n\n###  A note from Cleveland Clinic\n\nMany people will get a diagnosis of myopia (nearsightedness). Today, there are\ntreatments that make it possible to obtain sharp vision despite this\ncondition. It\u2019s important to make and keep regular eye appointments.\nDiagnosing and treating any vision issue early is best. And remember, try not\nto let your or your child\u2019s eyes get stuck in \u201cnear gear\u201d from spending too\nmuch time on computers or smartphones. Get outside. Take a walk. Fresh air\ndoes the body, and eyes, good.\n\n[ ](mailto:?subject=Cleveland Clinic - Myopia\n\\(Nearsightedness\\)&body=https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/8579-myopia-\nnearsightedness)\n\nMedically Reviewed\n\nLast reviewed by a Cleveland Clinic medical professional on 10/13/2023.\n\nLearn more about our [ editorial process\n](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/about/website/editorial-policy) .\n\n####  References\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.

Protect yourself and others from the sun with shade, a shirt, or sunblock (SPF 15+) all year long. Ultraviolet (UV) radiation is a form of non-ionizing radiation that is emitted by the sun and artificial sources, such as tanning beds. While it has some benefits for people, including the creation of Vitamin D, it also can cause health risks. Our natural source of UV radiation: The sun Some artificial sources of UV radiation include: Tanning beds Mercury vapor lighting (often found in stadiums and school gyms) Some halogen, fluorescent, and incandescent lights Some types of lasers Types of UV Radiation Rays UV radiation is classified into three primary types: ultraviolet A (UVA), ultraviolet B (UVB), and ultraviolet C (UVC), based on their wavelengths. Almost all the UV radiation that reaches earth is UVA though some UVB radiation reaches earth. UVA and UVB radiation can both affect health, but UVA penetrates deeper into the skin and is more constant throughout the year. Wave Types, Wavelengths, and Absorption Levels Wave Type UVA UVB UVC Wavelength* 315- 399 nm 280-314 nm 100-279 nm Absorption Level Not absorbed by the ozone layer Mostly absorbed by the ozone layer, but some does reach the Earth\u2019s surface Completely absorbed by the ozone layer and atmosphere *nm= 0.000000001 meters or 1\u00d710-9 meters Benefits The production of vitamin D, a vitamin essential to human health. Vitamin D helps the body absorb calcium and phosphorus from food and assists bone development. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends 5 to 15 minutes of sun exposure 2 to 3 times a week. Risks Sunscreen and sunglasses can be used to protect you from UV radiation. Sunburn is a sign of short-term overexposure, while premature aging and skin cancer are side effects of prolonged UV exposure. UV exposure increases the risk of potentially blinding eye diseases if eye protection is not used. Overexposure to UV radiation can lead to serious health issues, including cancer. Skin cancer is the most common cancer in the United States. The two most common types of skin cancer are basal cell cancer and squamous cell cancer. Typically, they form on the head, face, neck, hands, and arms because these body parts are the most exposed to UV radiation. Most cases of melanoma, the deadliest kind of skin cancer, are caused by exposure to UV radiation. Anyone can have harmful health effects from UV radiation, but the risks increase in people who: Spend a lot of time in the sun or have been sunburned. Have light-color skin, hair, and eyes. Take some types of oral and topical medicines, such as antibiotics, birth control pills, and benzoyl peroxide products, as well as some cosmetics, may increase skin and eye sensitivity to UV in all skin types. Have a family member with skin cancer. Are over age 50. To protect yourself from UV radiation Stay in the shade, especially during midday hours. Wear clothes that cover your arms and legs. Consider options to protect your children. Wear a wide brim hat to shade your face, head, ears, and neck. Wear wraparound sunglasses that block both UVA and UVB rays. Use sunscreen with sun protection factor (SPF) 15 or higher, for both UVA and UVB protection. Avoid indoor tanning. Indoor tanning is particularly dangerous for younger users; people who begin indoor tanning during adolescence or early adulthood have a higher risk of developing melanoma.

    "content": "What is a neural network?\n\nExplore IBM's neural network solution  Subscribe to AI Topic Updates\n\nWhat is a neural network?\n\nA neural network is a  machine learning  program, or model, that makes\ndecisions in a manner similar to the human brain, by using processes that\nmimic the way biological neurons work together to identify phenomena, weigh\noptions and arrive at conclusions.\n\nEvery neural network consists of layers of nodes, or artificial neurons\u2014an\ninput layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. Each node\nconnects to others, and has its own associated weight and threshold. If the\noutput of any individual node is above the specified threshold value, that\nnode is activated, sending data to the next layer of the network. Otherwise,\nno data is passed along to the next layer of the network.  \n\nNeural networks rely on training data to learn and improve their accuracy over\ntime. Once they are fine-tuned for accuracy, they are powerful tools in\ncomputer science and  artificial intelligence  , allowing us to classify and\ncluster data at a high velocity. Tasks in speech recognition or image\nrecognition can take minutes versus hours when compared to the manual\nidentification by human experts. One of the best-known examples of a neural\nnetwork is Google\u2019s search algorithm.\n\nNeural networks are sometimes called artificial neural networks (ANNs) or\nsimulated neural networks (SNNs). They are a subset of machine learning, and\nat the heart of  deep learning  models.\n\nEbook  Build responsible AI workflows with AI governance\n\nLearn the building blocks and best practices to help your teams accelerate\nresponsible AI.\n\nRelated content\n\nRegister for the ebook on generative AI\n\nHow do neural networks work?\n\nThink of each individual node as its own  linear regression  model, composed\nof input data, weights, a bias (or threshold), and an output. The formula\nwould look something like this:\n\n\u2211wixi + bias = w1x1 + w2x2 + w3x3 + bias\n\noutput = f(x) = 1 if \u2211w1x1 + b>= 0; 0 if \u2211w1x1 + b < 0\n\nOnce an input layer is determined, weights are assigned. These weights help\ndetermine the importance of any given variable, with larger ones contributing\nmore significantly to the output compared to other inputs. All inputs are then\nmultiplied by their respective weights and then summed. Afterward, the output\nis passed through an activation function, which determines the output. If that\noutput exceeds a given threshold, it \u201cfires\u201d (or activates) the node, passing\ndata to the next layer in the network. This results in the output of one node\nbecoming in the input of the next node. This process of passing data from one\nlayer to the next layer defines this neural network as a feedforward network.\n\nLet\u2019s break down what one single node might look like using binary values. We\ncan apply this concept to a more tangible example, like whether you should go\nsurfing (Yes: 1, No: 0). The decision to go or not to go is our predicted\noutcome, or y-hat. Let\u2019s assume that there are three factors influencing your\ndecision-making:\n\n  1. Are the waves good? (Yes: 1, No: 0) \n  2. Is the line-up empty? (Yes: 1, No: 0) \n  3. Has there been a recent shark attack? (Yes: 0, No: 1) \n\nThen, let\u2019s assume the following, giving us the following inputs:\n\n  * X1 = 1, since the waves are pumping \n  * X2 = 0, since the crowds are out \n  * X3 = 1, since there hasn\u2019t been a recent shark attack \n\nNow, we need to assign some weights to determine importance. Larger weights\nsignify that particular variables are of greater importance to the decision or\noutcome.\n\n  * W1 = 5, since large swells don\u2019t come around often \n  * W2 = 2, since you\u2019re used to the crowds \n  * W3 = 4, since you have a fear of sharks \n\nFinally, we\u2019ll also assume a threshold value of 3, which would translate to a\nbias value of \u20133. With all the various inputs, we can start to plug in values\ninto the formula to get the desired output.\n\nY-hat = (1*5) + (0*2) + (1*4) \u2013 3 = 6\n\nIf we use the activation function from the beginning of this section, we can\ndetermine that the output of this node would be 1, since 6 is greater than 0.\nIn this instance, you would go surfing; but if we adjust the weights or the\nthreshold, we can achieve different outcomes from the model. When we observe\none decision, like in the above example, we can see how a neural network could\nmake increasingly complex decisions depending on the output of previous\ndecisions or layers.\n\nIn the example above, we used perceptrons to illustrate some of the\nmathematics at play here, but neural networks leverage sigmoid neurons, which\nare distinguished by having values between 0 and 1. Since neural networks\nbehave similarly to decision trees, cascading data from one node to another,\nhaving x values between 0 and 1 will reduce the impact of any given change of\na single variable on the output of any given node, and subsequently, the\noutput of the neural network.\n\nAs we start to think about more practical use cases for neural networks, like\nimage recognition or classification, we\u2019ll leverage supervised learning, or\nlabeled datasets, to train the algorithm. As we train the model, we\u2019ll want to\nevaluate its accuracy using a cost (or loss) function. This is also commonly\nreferred to as the mean squared error (MSE). In the equation below,\n\n  * i  represents the index of the sample, \n  * y-hat is the predicted outcome, \n  * y is the actual value, and \n  * m  is the number of samples. \n\n\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc61 \ud835\udc39\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5b= \ud835\udc40\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc38=1/2\ud835\udc5a \u2211129_(\ud835\udc56=1)^\ud835\udc5a\u2592(\ud835\udc66 \u0302^((\ud835\udc56) )\u2212\ud835\udc66^((\ud835\udc56) ) )^2\n\nUltimately, the goal is to minimize our cost function to ensure correctness of\nfit for any given observation. As the model adjusts its weights and bias, it\nuses the cost function and reinforcement learning to reach the point of\nconvergence, or the local minimum. The process in which the algorithm adjusts\nits weights is through gradient descent, allowing the model to determine the\ndirection to take to reduce errors (or minimize the cost function). With each\ntraining example, the parameters of the model adjust to gradually converge at\nthe minimum.\n\nSee this  IBM Developer article for a deeper explanation of the quantitative\nconcepts involved in neural networks  .\n\nMost deep neural networks are feedforward, meaning they flow in one direction\nonly, from input to output. However, you can also train your model through\nbackpropagation; that is, move in the opposite direction from output to input.\nBackpropagation allows us to calculate and attribute the error associated with\neach neuron, allowing us to adjust and fit the parameters of the model(s)\nappropriately.\n\nTrial  Now available: watsonx.ai\n\nThe all new enterprise studio that brings together traditional machine\nlearning along with new generative AI capabilities powered by foundation\nmodels.\n\nTypes of neural networks\n\nNeural networks can be classified into different types, which are used for\ndifferent purposes. While this isn\u2019t a comprehensive list of types, the below\nwould be representative of the most common types of neural networks that\nyou\u2019ll come across for its common use cases:\n\nThe perceptron is the oldest neural network, created by Frank Rosenblatt in\n1958.\n\nFeedforward neural networks, or multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), are what we\u2019ve\nprimarily been focusing on within this article. They are comprised of an input\nlayer, a hidden layer or layers, and an output layer. While these neural\nnetworks are also commonly referred to as MLPs, it\u2019s important to note that\nthey are actually comprised of sigmoid neurons, not perceptrons, as most real-\nworld problems are nonlinear. Data usually is fed into these models to train\nthem, and they are the foundation for computer vision,  natural language\nprocessing  , and other neural networks.\n\nConvolutional neural networks (CNNs)  are similar to feedforward networks, but\nthey\u2019re usually utilized for image recognition, pattern recognition, and/or\ncomputer vision. These networks harness principles from linear algebra,\nparticularly matrix multiplication, to identify patterns within an image.\n\nRecurrent neural networks (RNNs)  are identified by their feedback loops.\nThese learning algorithms are primarily leveraged when using time-series data\nto make predictions about future outcomes, such as stock market predictions or\nsales forecasting.\n\n##\n\nNeural networks vs. deep learning\n\nDeep Learning and neural networks tend to be used interchangeably in\nconversation, which can be confusing. As a result, it\u2019s worth noting that the\n\u201cdeep\u201d in deep learning is just referring to the depth of layers in a neural\nnetwork. A neural network that consists of more than three layers\u2014which would\nbe inclusive of the inputs and the output\u2014can be considered a deep learning\nalgorithm. A neural network that only has two or three layers is just a basic\nneural network.\n\nTo learn more about the differences between neural networks and other forms of\nartificial intelligence, like machine learning, please read the blog post \u201c\nAI vs. Machine Learning vs. Deep Learning vs. Neural Networks: What\u2019s the\nDifference?  \u201d\n\nHistory of neural networks\n\nThe history of neural networks is longer than most people think. While the\nidea of \u201ca machine that thinks\u201d can be traced to the Ancient Greeks, we\u2019ll\nfocus on the key events that led to the evolution of thinking around neural\nnetworks, which has ebbed and flowed in popularity over the years:\n\n1943:  Warren S. McCulloch and Walter Pitts published \u201c  A logical calculus of\nthe ideas immanent in nervous activity  (link resides outside ibm.com)\u201d This\nresearch sought to understand how the human brain could produce complex\npatterns through connected brain cells, or neurons. One of the main ideas that\ncame out of this work was the comparison of neurons with a binary threshold to\nBoolean logic (i.e., 0/1 or true/false statements).\n\n1958:  Frank Rosenblatt is credited with the development of the perceptron,\ndocumented in his research, \u201c  The Perceptron: A Probabilistic Model for\nInformation Storage and Organization in the Brain  \u201d (link resides outside\nibm.com).

Leveraging an IBM 704, Rosenblatt was able to get a\ncomputer to learn how to distinguish cards marked on the left vs. cards marked\non the right.\n\n1974:  While numerous researchers contributed to the idea of backpropagation,\nPaul Werbos was the first person in the US to note its application within\nneural networks within his  PhD thesis  (link resides outside ibm.com).\n\n1989:  Yann LeCun published a  paper  (link resides outside ibm.com)\nillustrating how the use of constraints in backpropagation and its integration\ninto the neural network architecture can be used to train algorithms.

    "content": "\nLight or visible light is electromagnetic radiation that can be perceived by the human eye. Visible light is usually defined as having wavelengths in the range of 400\u2013700 nanometres (nm), corresponding to frequencies of 750\u2013420 terahertz, between the infrared (with longer wavelengths) and the ultraviolet (with shorter wavelengths).\nIn physics, the term \"light\" may refer more broadly to electromagnetic radiation of any wavelength, whether visible or not. In this sense, gamma rays, X-rays, microwaves and radio waves are also light. The primary properties of light are intensity, propagation direction, frequency or wavelength spectrum, and polarization. Its speed in vacuum, 299792458\u00a0m/s, is one of the fundamental constants of nature. Like all types of electromagnetic radiation, visible light propagates by massless elementary particles called photons that represents the quanta of electromagnetic field, and can be analyzed as both waves and particles. The study of light, known as optics, is an important research area in modern physics.\nThe main source of natural light on Earth is the Sun.  Historically, another important source of light for humans has been fire, from ancient campfires to modern kerosene lamps. With the development of electric lights and power systems, electric lighting has effectively replaced firelight.\n\nElectromagnetic spectrum and visible light\nThe electromagnetic spectrum, with the visible portion highlighted. The bottom graph (Visible spectrum) is wavelength in units of nanometres (nm).\n\nMain article: Electromagnetic spectrum\nGenerally, electromagnetic radiation (EMR)  is classified by wavelength into radio waves, microwaves, infrared, the visible spectrum that we perceive as light, ultraviolet, X-rays and gamma rays. The designation \"radiation\" excludes static electric, magnetic and near fields.\nThe behavior of EMR depends on its wavelength. Higher frequencies have shorter wavelengths and lower frequencies have longer wavelengths.  When EMR interacts with single atoms and molecules, its behavior depends on the amount of energy per quantum it carries.\nEMR in the visible light region consists of quanta (called photons) that are at the lower end of the energies that are capable of causing electronic excitation within molecules, which leads to changes in the bonding or chemistry of the molecule. At the lower end of the visible light spectrum, EMR becomes invisible to humans (infrared) because its photons no longer have enough individual energy to cause a lasting molecular change (a change in conformation) in the visual molecule retinal in the human retina, which change triggers the sensation of vision.\nThere exist animals that are sensitive to various types of infrared, but not by means of quantum-absorption. Infrared sensing in snakes depends on a kind of natural thermal imaging, in which tiny packets of cellular water are raised in temperature by the infrared radiation. EMR in this range causes molecular vibration and heating effects, which is how these animals detect it.\nAbove the range of visible light, ultraviolet light becomes invisible to humans, mostly because it is absorbed by the cornea below 360 nm and the internal lens below 400\u00a0nm. Furthermore, the rods and cones located in the retina of the human eye cannot detect the very short (below 360\u00a0nm) ultraviolet wavelengths and are in fact damaged by ultraviolet. Many animals with eyes that do not require lenses (such as insects and shrimp) are able to detect ultraviolet, by quantum photon-absorption mechanisms, in much the same chemical way that humans detect visible light.\nVarious sources define visible light as narrowly as 420\u2013680\u00a0nm to as broadly as 380\u2013800\u00a0nm. Under ideal laboratory conditions, people can see infrared up to at least 1,050\u00a0nm; children and young adults may perceive ultraviolet wavelengths down to about 310\u2013313\u00a0nm.\nPlant growth is also affected by the colour spectrum of light, a process known as photomorphogenesis.\n\nSpeed of light\n\nMain article: Speed of light\nBeam of sun light inside the cavity of Rocca ill'Abissu at Fondachelli-Fantina, Sicily\nThe speed of light in vacuum is defined to be exactly 299 792 458\u00a0m/s (approx. 186,282 miles per second). The fixed value of the speed of light in SI units results from the fact that the metre is now defined in terms of the speed of light. All forms of electromagnetic radiation move at exactly this same speed in vacuum.\nDifferent physicists have attempted to measure the speed of light throughout history. Galileo attempted to measure the speed of light in the seventeenth century. An early experiment to measure the speed of light was conducted by Ole R\u00f8mer, a Danish physicist, in 1676. Using a telescope, R\u00f8mer observed the motions of Jupiter and one of its moons, Io. Noting discrepancies in the apparent period of Io's orbit, he calculated that light takes about 22 minutes to traverse the diameter of Earth's orbit. However, its size was not known at that time. If R\u00f8mer had known the diameter of the Earth's orbit, he would have calculated a speed of 227000000\u00a0m/s.\nAnother more accurate measurement of the speed of light was performed in Europe by Hippolyte Fizeau in 1849. Fizeau directed a beam of light at a mirror several kilometers away. A rotating cog wheel was placed in the path of the light beam as it traveled from the source, to the mirror and then returned to its origin.  Fizeau found that at a certain rate of rotation, the beam would pass through one gap in the wheel on the way out and the next gap on the way back. Knowing the distance to the mirror, the number of teeth on the wheel and the rate of rotation, Fizeau was able to calculate the speed of light as 313000000\u00a0m/s.\nL\u00e9on Foucault carried out an experiment which used rotating mirrors to obtain a value of 298 000 000\u00a0m/s in 1862. Albert A. Michelson conducted experiments on the speed of light from 1877 until his death in 1931. He refined Foucault's methods in 1926 using improved rotating mirrors to measure the time it took light to make a round trip from Mount Wilson to Mount San Antonio in California. The precise measurements yielded a speed of  299 796 000\u00a0m/s.\nThe effective velocity of light in various transparent substances containing ordinary matter, is less than in vacuum. For example, the speed of light in water is about 3/4 of that in vacuum.\nTwo independent teams of physicists were said to bring light to a \"complete standstill\" by passing it through a Bose\u2013Einstein condensate of the element rubidium, one team at Harvard University and the Rowland Institute for Science in Cambridge, Massachusetts and the other at the Harvard\u2013Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, also in Cambridge. However, the popular description of light being \"stopped\" in these experiments refers only to light being stored in the excited states of atoms, then re-emitted at an arbitrary later time, as stimulated by a second laser pulse. During the time it had \"stopped\", it had ceased to be light.\n\nOptics\n\n\nMain article: Optics\nThe study of light and the interaction of light and matter is termed optics. The observation and study of optical phenomena such as rainbows and the aurora borealis offer many clues as to the nature of light.\nA transparent object allows light to transmit or pass through. Conversely, an opaque object does not allow light to transmit through and instead reflecting or absorbing the light it receives. Most objects do not reflect or transmit light specularly and to some degree scatters the incoming light, which is called glossiness. Surface scatterance is caused by the surface roughness of the reflecting surfaces, and internal scatterance is caused by the difference of refractive index between the particles and medium inside the object. Like transparent objects, translucent objects allow light to transmit through, but translucent objects also scatter certain wavelength of light via internal scatterance.\nRefraction\n\nMain article: Refraction\nDue to refraction, the straw dipped in water appears bent and the ruler scale compressed when viewed from a shallow angle.\nRefraction is the bending of light rays when passing through a surface between one transparent material and another. It is described by Snell's Law:\nn\n\n1\n\n\nsin\n\u2061\n\n\u03b8\n\n1\n\n\n=\n\nn\n\n2\n\n\nsin\n\u2061\n\n\u03b8\n\n2\n\n\n\u00a0\n.\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n_{1}\\sin \\theta _{1}=n_{2}\\sin \\theta _{2}\\ .}\nwhere \u03b81 is the angle between the ray and the surface normal in the first medium, \u03b82 is the angle between the ray and the surface normal in the second medium and n1 and n2 are the indices of refraction, n = 1 in a vacuum and n > 1 in a transparent substance.\nWhen a beam of light crosses the boundary between a vacuum and another medium, or between two different media, the wavelength of the light changes, but the frequency remains constant. If the beam of light is not orthogonal (or rather normal) to the boundary, the change in wavelength results in a change in the direction of the beam. This change of direction is known as refraction.\nThe refractive quality of lenses is frequently used to manipulate light in order to change the apparent size of images. Magnifying glasses, spectacles, contact lenses, microscopes and refracting telescopes are all examples of this manipulation.\n\nLight sources\n\n\"Lightsource\" redirects here. For the solar energy developer named Lightsource, see Lightsource Renewable Energy. For a particle accelerator used to generate X-rays, see Synchrotron light source.\n\nFurther information: List of light sources\nThere are many sources of light. A body at a given temperature emits a characteristic spectrum of black-body radiation. A simple thermal source is sunlight, the radiation emitted by the chromosphere of the Sun at around 6,000\u00a0K (5,730\u00a0\u00b0C; 10,340\u00a0\u00b0F). Solar radiation peaks in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum when plotted in wavelength units, and roughly 44% of the radiation that reaches the ground is visible. Another example is incandescent light bulbs, which emit only around 10% of their energy as visible light and the remainder as infrared. A common thermal light source in history is the glowing solid particles in flames, but these also emit most of their radiation in the infrared and only a fraction in the visible spectrum.\nThe peak of the black-body spectrum is in the deep infrared, at about 10 micrometre wavelength, for relatively cool objects like human beings. As the temperature increases, the peak shifts to shorter wavelengths, producing first a red glow, then a white one and finally a blue-white colour as the peak moves out of the visible part of the spectrum and into the ultraviolet. These colours can be seen when metal is heated to \"red hot\" or \"white hot\". Blue-white thermal emission is not often seen, except in stars (the commonly seen pure-blue colour in a gas flame or a welder's torch is in fact due to molecular emission, notably by CH radicals emitting a wavelength band around 425\u00a0nm and is not seen in stars or pure thermal radiation).\nAtoms emit and absorb light at characteristic energies. This produces \"emission lines\" in the spectrum of each atom. Emission can be spontaneous, as in light-emitting diodes, gas discharge lamps (such as neon lamps and neon signs, mercury-vapor lamps, etc.) and flames (light from the hot gas itself\u2014so, for example, sodium in a gas flame emits characteristic yellow light). Emission can also be stimulated, as in a laser or a microwave maser.\nDeceleration of a free charged particle, such as an electron, can produce visible radiation: cyclotron radiation, synchrotron radiation and bremsstrahlung radiation are all examples of this. Particles moving through a medium faster than the speed of light in that medium can produce visible Cherenkov radiation. Certain chemicals produce visible radiation by chemoluminescence. In living things, this process is called bioluminescence. For example, fireflies produce light by this means and boats moving through water can disturb plankton which produce a glowing wake.\nCertain substances produce light when they are illuminated by more energetic radiation, a process known as fluorescence. Some substances emit light slowly after excitation by more energetic radiation. This is known as phosphorescence. Phosphorescent materials can also be excited by bombarding them with subatomic particles. Cathodoluminescence is one example. This mechanism is used in cathode-ray tube television sets and computer monitors.\nHong Kong illuminated by colourful artificial lighting\nCertain other mechanisms can produce light:\nBioluminescence\nCherenkov radiation\nElectroluminescence\nScintillation\nSonoluminescence\nTriboluminescence\nWhen the concept of light is intended to include very-high-energy photons (gamma rays), additional generation mechanisms include:\nParticle\u2013antiparticle annihilation\nRadioactive decay\n\nMeasurement\n\nMain articles: Photometry (optics) and Radiometry\nLight is measured with two main alternative sets of units: radiometry consists of measurements of light power at all wavelengths, while photometry measures light with wavelength weighted with respect to a standardized model of human brightness perception.  Photometry is useful, for example, to quantify Illumination (lighting) intended for human use.\nThe photometry units are different from most systems of physical units in that they take into account how the human eye responds to light. The cone cells in the human eye are of three types which respond differently across the visible spectrum and the cumulative response peaks at a wavelength of around 555\u00a0nm. Therefore, two sources of light which produce the same intensity (W/m) of visible light do not necessarily appear equally bright. The photometry units are designed to take this into account and therefore are a better representation of how \"bright\" a light appears to be than raw intensity. They relate to raw power by a quantity called luminous efficacy and are used for purposes like determining how to best achieve sufficient illumination for various tasks in indoor and outdoor settings. The illumination measured by a photocell sensor does not necessarily correspond to what is perceived by the human eye and without filters which may be costly, photocells and charge-coupled devices (CCD) tend to respond to some infrared, ultraviolet or both.\n\nLight pressure\n\nMain article: Radiation pressure\nLight exerts physical pressure on objects in its path, a phenomenon which can be deduced by Maxwell's equations, but can be more easily explained by the particle nature of light: photons strike and transfer their momentum. Light pressure is equal to the power of the light beam divided by c, the speed of light.\u00a0 Due to the magnitude of c, the effect of light pressure is negligible for everyday objects.\u00a0 For example, a one-milliwatt laser pointer exerts a force of about 3.3 piconewtons on the object being illuminated; thus, one could lift a U.S. penny with laser pointers, but doing so would require about 30\u00a0billion 1-mW laser pointers.\u00a0 However, in nanometre-scale applications such as nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS), the effect of light pressure is more significant and exploiting light pressure to drive NEMS mechanisms and to flip nanometre-scale physical switches in integrated circuits is an active area of research. At larger scales, light pressure can cause asteroids to spin faster, acting on their irregular shapes as on the vanes of a windmill.\u00a0 The possibility of making solar sails that would accelerate spaceships in space is also under investigation.\nAlthough the motion of the Crookes radiometer was originally attributed to light pressure, this interpretation is incorrect; the characteristic Crookes rotation is the result of a partial vacuum. This should not be confused with the Nichols radiometer, in which the (slight) motion caused by torque (though not enough for full rotation against friction) is directly caused by light pressure.\nAs a consequence of light pressure, Einstein in 1909 predicted the existence of \"radiation friction\" which would oppose the movement of matter. He wrote, \"radiation will exert pressure on both sides of the plate. The forces of pressure exerted on the two sides are equal if the plate is at rest. However, if it is in motion, more radiation will be reflected on the surface that is ahead during the motion (front surface) than on the back surface. The backwardacting force of pressure exerted on the front surface is thus larger than the force of pressure acting on the back. Hence, as the resultant of the two forces, there remains a force that counteracts the motion of the plate and that increases with the velocity of the plate. We will call this resultant 'radiation friction' in brief.\"\nUsually light momentum is aligned with its direction of motion. However, for example in evanescent waves momentum is transverse to direction of propagation.\n\nHistorical theories about light, in chronological order\nClassical Greece and Hellenism\nIn the fifth century BC, Empedocles postulated that everything was composed of four elements; fire, air, earth and water. He believed that Aphrodite made the human eye out of the four elements and that she lit the fire in the eye which shone out from the eye making sight possible. If this were true, then one could see during the night just as well as during the day, so Empedocles postulated an interaction between rays from the eyes and rays from a source such as the sun.\nIn about 300 BC, Euclid wrote Optica, in which he studied the properties of light. Euclid postulated that light travelled in straight lines and he described the laws of reflection and studied them mathematically. He questioned that sight is the result of a beam from the eye, for he asks how one sees the stars immediately, if one closes one's eyes, then opens them at night. If the beam from the eye travels infinitely fast this is not a problem.\nIn 55 BC, Lucretius, a Roman who carried on the ideas of earlier Greek atomists, wrote that \"The light & heat of the sun; these are composed of minute atoms which, when they are shoved off, lose no time in shooting right across the interspace of air in the direction imparted by the shove.\" (from On the nature of the Universe). Despite being similar to later particle theories, Lucretius's views were not generally accepted. Ptolemy (c. second century) wrote about the refraction of light in his book Optics.\nClassical India\nIn ancient India, the Hindu schools of Samkhya and Vaisheshika, from around the early centuries AD developed theories on light. According to the Samkhya school, light is one of the five fundamental \"subtle\" elements (tanmatra) out of which emerge the gross elements. The atomicity of these elements is not specifically mentioned and it appears that they were actually taken to be continuous.\nThe Vishnu Purana refers to sunlight as \"the seven rays of the sun\".\nThe Indian Buddhists, such as Dign\u0101ga in the fifth century and Dharmakirti in the seventh century, developed a type of atomism that is a philosophy about reality being composed of atomic entities that are momentary flashes of light or energy. They viewed light as being an atomic entity equivalent to energy.\nDescartes\nRen\u00e9 Descartes (1596\u20131650) held that light was a mechanical property of the luminous body, rejecting the \"forms\" of Ibn al-Haytham and Witelo as well as the \"species\" of Bacon, Grosseteste and Kepler. In 1637 he published a theory of the refraction of light that assumed, incorrectly, that light travelled faster in a denser medium than in a less dense medium. Descartes arrived at this conclusion by analogy with the behaviour of sound waves. Although Descartes was incorrect about the relative speeds, he was correct in assuming that light behaved like a wave and in concluding that refraction could be explained by the speed of light in different media.\nDescartes is not the first to use the mechanical analogies but because he clearly asserts that light is only a mechanical property of the luminous body and the transmitting medium, Descartes's theory of light is regarded as the start of modern physical optics.\nParticle theory\n\nMain article: Corpuscular theory of light\nPierre Gassendi\nPierre Gassendi (1592\u20131655), an atomist, proposed a particle theory of light which was published posthumously in the 1660s.  Isaac Newton studied Gassendi's work at an early age and preferred his view to Descartes's theory of the plenum. He stated in his Hypothesis of Light of 1675 that light was composed of corpuscles (particles of matter) which were emitted in all directions from a source. One of Newton's arguments against the wave nature of light was that waves were known to bend around obstacles, while light travelled only in straight lines. He did, however, explain the phenomenon of the diffraction of light (which had been observed by Francesco Grimaldi) by allowing that a light particle could create a localised wave in the aether.\nNewton's theory could be used to predict the reflection of light, but could only explain refraction by incorrectly assuming that light accelerated upon entering a denser medium because the gravitational pull was greater. Newton published the final version of his theory in his Opticks of 1704. His reputation helped the particle theory of light to hold sway during the eighteenth century. The particle theory of light led Laplace to argue that a body could be so massive that light could not escape from it. In other words, it would become what is now called a black hole. Laplace withdrew his suggestion later, after a wave theory of light became firmly established as the model for light (as has been explained, neither a particle or wave theory is fully correct). A translation of Newton's essay on light appears in The large scale structure of space-time, by Stephen Hawking and George F. R. Ellis.\nThe fact that light could be polarized was for the first time qualitatively explained by Newton using the particle theory. \u00c9tienne-Louis Malus in 1810 created a mathematical particle theory of polarization. Jean-Baptiste Biot in 1812 showed that this theory explained all known phenomena of light polarization. At that time the polarization was considered as the proof of the particle theory.\nWave theory\nTo explain the origin of colours, Robert Hooke (1635\u20131703) developed a \"pulse theory\" and compared the spreading of light to that of waves in water in his 1665 work Micrographia (\"Observation IX\"). In 1672 Hooke suggested that light's vibrations could be perpendicular to the direction of propagation. Christiaan Huygens (1629\u20131695) worked out a mathematical wave theory of light in 1678 and published it in his Treatise on Light in 1690. He proposed that light was emitted in all directions as a series of waves in a medium called the luminiferous aether. As waves are not affected by gravity, it was assumed that they slowed down upon entering a denser medium.\nChristiaan Huygens\nThomas Young's sketch of a double-slit experiment showing diffraction. Young's experiments supported the theory that light consists of waves.\nThe wave theory predicted that light waves could interfere with each other like sound waves (as noted around 1800 by Thomas Young). Young showed by means of a diffraction experiment that light behaved as waves. He also proposed that different colours were caused by different wavelengths of light and explained colour vision in terms of three-coloured receptors in the eye. Another supporter of the wave theory was Leonhard Euler. He argued in Nova theoria lucis et colorum (1746) that diffraction could more easily be explained by a wave theory. In 1816 Andr\u00e9-Marie Amp\u00e8re gave Augustin-Jean Fresnel an idea that the polarization of light can be explained by the wave theory if light were a transverse wave.\nLater, Fresnel independently worked out his own wave theory of light and presented it to the Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences in 1817. Sim\u00e9on Denis Poisson added to Fresnel's mathematical work to produce a convincing argument in favor of the wave theory, helping to overturn Newton's corpuscular theory. By the year 1821, Fresnel was able to show via mathematical methods that polarization could be explained by the wave theory of light if and only if light was entirely transverse, with no longitudinal vibration whatsoever.\nThe weakness of the wave theory was that light waves, like sound waves, would need a medium for transmission. The existence of the hypothetical substance luminiferous aether proposed by Huygens in 1678 was cast into strong doubt in the late nineteenth century by the Michelson\u2013Morley experiment.\nNewton's corpuscular theory implied that light would travel faster in a denser medium, while the wave theory of Huygens and others implied the opposite. At that time, the speed of light could not be measured accurately enough to decide which theory was correct. The first to make a sufficiently accurate measurement was L\u00e9on Foucault, in 1850. His result supported the wave theory and the classical particle theory was finally abandoned, only to partly re-emerge in the twentieth century.\nElectromagnetic theory\n\nMain article: Electromagnetic radiation\nA linearly polarized electromagnetic wave traveling along the z-axis, with E denoting the electric field and perpendicular B denoting magnetic field\nIn 1845, Michael Faraday discovered that the plane of polarization of linearly polarized light is rotated when the light rays travel along the magnetic field direction in the presence of a transparent dielectric, an effect now known as Faraday rotation. This was the first evidence that light was related to electromagnetism. In 1846 he speculated that light might be some form of disturbance propagating along magnetic field lines. Faraday proposed in 1847 that light was a high-frequency electromagnetic vibration, which could propagate even in the absence of a medium such as the ether.\nFaraday's work inspired James Clerk Maxwell to study electromagnetic radiation and light. Maxwell discovered that self-propagating electromagnetic waves would travel through space at a constant speed, which happened to be equal to the previously measured speed of light. From this, Maxwell concluded that light was a form of electromagnetic radiation: he first stated this result in 1862 in On Physical Lines of Force. In 1873, he published A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism, which contained a full mathematical description of the behavior of electric and magnetic fields, still known as Maxwell's equations. Soon after, Heinrich Hertz confirmed Maxwell's theory experimentally by generating and detecting radio waves in the laboratory and demonstrating that these waves behaved exactly like visible light, exhibiting properties such as reflection, refraction, diffraction and interference. Maxwell's theory and Hertz's experiments led directly to the development of modern radio, radar, television, electromagnetic imaging and wireless communications.\nIn the quantum theory, photons are seen as wave packets of the waves described in the classical theory of Maxwell. The quantum theory was needed to explain effects even with visual light that Maxwell's classical theory could not (such as spectral lines).\nQuantum theory\nIn 1900 Max Planck, attempting to explain black-body radiation, suggested that although light was a wave, these waves could gain or lose energy only in finite amounts related to their frequency. Planck called these \"lumps\" of light energy \"quanta\" (from a Latin word for \"how much\"). In 1905, Albert Einstein used the idea of light quanta to explain the photoelectric effect and suggested that these light quanta had a \"real\" existence. In 1923 Arthur Holly Compton showed that the wavelength shift seen when low intensity X-rays scattered from electrons (so called Compton scattering) could be explained by a particle-theory of X-rays, but not a wave theory. In 1926 Gilbert N. Lewis named these light quanta particles photons.\nEventually the modern theory of quantum mechanics came to picture light as (in some sense) both a particle and a wave and (in another sense), as a phenomenon which is neither a particle nor a wave (which actually are macroscopic phenomena, such as baseballs or ocean waves). Instead, modern physics sees light as something that can be described sometimes with mathematics appropriate to one type of macroscopic metaphor (particles) and sometimes another macroscopic metaphor (water waves), but is actually something that cannot be fully imagined. As in the case for radio waves and the X-rays involved in Compton scattering, physicists have noted that electromagnetic radiation tends to behave more like a classical wave at lower frequencies, but more like a classical particle at higher frequencies, but never completely loses all qualities of one or the other. Visible light, which occupies a middle ground in frequency, can easily be shown in experiments to be describable using either a wave or particle model, or sometimes both.\nIn February 2018, scientists reported, for the first time, the discovery of a new form of light, which may involve polaritons, that could be useful in the development of quantum computers.\n\nUse for light on Earth\nSunlight provides the energy that green plants use to create sugars mostly in the form of starches, which release energy into the living things that digest them. This process of photosynthesis provides virtually all the energy used by living things. Some species of animals generate their own light, a process called bioluminescence. For example, fireflies use light to locate mates and vampire squid use it to hide themselves from prey.\n\nSee also\nPhysics portalScience portal\nAutomotive lighting\nBallistic photon\nColour temperature\nFermat's principle\nHuygens' principle\nJournal of Luminescence\nLight art\nLight beam \u2013 in particular about light beams visible from the side\nLight Fantastic (TV series)\nLight mill\nLight painting\nLight pollution\nLight therapy\nLighting\nList of light sources\nLuminescence: The Journal of Biological and Chemical Luminescence\nPhotic sneeze reflex\nRight to light\nRisks and benefits of sun exposure\nSpectroscopy\n\nNotes\n"

Fluoride is the ionic form of the element fluorine, and it\ninhibits or reverses the initiation and progression of dental caries (tooth\ndecay) and stimulates new bone formation [  1  ].\n\nSoil, water, plants, and foods contain trace amounts of fluoride. Most of the\nfluoride that people consume comes from fluoridated water, foods and beverages\nprepared with fluoridated water, and toothpaste and other dental products\ncontaining fluoride [  2  ,  3  ].\n\nApproximately 80% or more of orally ingested fluoride is absorbed in the\ngastrointestinal tract [  1  ]. In adults, about 50% of absorbed fluoride is\nretained, and bones and teeth store about 99% of fluoride in the body [  1  ,\n3  ]. The other 50% is excreted in urine [  1  ]. In young children, up to 80%\nof absorbed fluoride is retained because more is taken up by bones and teeth\nthan in adults [  1  ].\n\nIndividual fluoride status is not typically assessed, although fluoride\nconcentrations can be measured in plasma, saliva, urine, bones, nails, hair,\nand teeth [  4  ,  5  ]. Criteria for adequate, high, or low levels of\nfluoride in the body have not been established.\n\n##  Recommended Intakes\n\nIntake recommendations for fluoride and other nutrients are provided in the\nDietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) developed by the Food and Nutrition Board\n(FNB) at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine [  1\n]. DRI is the general term for a set of reference values used for planning and\nassessing nutrient intakes of healthy people. These values, which vary by age\nand sex, include the following:\n\n* Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA): Average daily level of intake sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of nearly all (97%\u201398%) healthy individuals; often used to plan nutritionally adequate diets for individuals\n* Adequate Intake (AI): Intake at this level is assumed to ensure nutritional adequacy; established when evidence is insufficient to develop an RDA\n* Estimated Average Requirement (EAR): Average daily level of intake estimated to meet the requirements of 50% of healthy individuals; usually used to assess the nutrient intakes of groups of people and to plan nutritionally adequate diets for them; can also be used to assess the nutrient intakes of individuals\n* Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL): Maximum daily intake unlikely to cause adverse health effects\n\nThe FNB found the data insufficient to derive EARs for fluoride. Therefore,\nthe board established AIs for all ages using estimated intakes shown to\nmaximize reductions in the incidence of dental caries without unwanted side\neffects, such as dental fluorosis, a chronic condition resulting from the\nconsumption of too much fluoride when teeth are developing [  1  ]. Table 1\nlists the current AIs for fluoride for healthy individuals.\n\nTable 1: Daily Adequate Intakes (AIs) for Fluoride [  1  ]  Age  |  Male  |\nFemale  |  Pregnancy  |  Lactation\n---|---|---|---|---\nBirth to 6 months  |  0.01 mg  |  0.01 mg  |  |\n7\u201312 months  |  0.5 mg  |  0.5 mg  |  |\n1\u20133 years  |  0.7 mg  |  0.7 mg  |  |\n4\u20138 years  |  1 mg  |  1 mg  |  |\n9\u201313 years  |  2 mg  |  2 mg  |  |\n14\u201318 years  |  3 mg  |  3 mg  |  3 mg  |  3 mg\n19+ years  |  4 mg  |  3 mg  |  3 mg  |  3 mg\n\n##  Sources of Fluoride\n\n###  Food\n\nBrewed tea typically contains higher levels of fluoride than most foods,\ndepending on the type of tea and its source, because tea plants take up\nfluoride from soil [  1  ,  3  ]. Fluoride levels can range from 0.3 to 6.5\nmg/L (0.07 to 1.5 mg/cup) in brewed tea made with distilled water [  3  ].\n\nFluoride concentrations in breast milk are so low that they cannot always be\ndetected; when these levels can be measured, they range from less than 0.002\nto 0.01 mg/L, even when mothers live in communities with fluoridated water [\n3  ]. Fluoride concentrations in cow\u2019s milk are also very low, ranging from\n0.007 to 0.086 mg/L [  3  ]. Fluoride levels in infant formulas in the United\nStates vary, depending on the type of formula and the fluoride content of the\nwater used to prepare the formula [  3  ]. The typical fluoride concentration\nis less than 0.2 mg/L in milk-based infant formula and 0.2 to 0.3 mg/L in soy-\nbased infant formula (not including contributions from tap water used to\nprepare the formula).\n\nOnly trace amounts of fluoride are naturally present in most foods, and most\nfoods not prepared with fluoridated water provide less than 0.05 mg/100 g [  1\n,  6  ].\n\nA variety of types of foods and their fluoride levels per serving are listed\nin Table 2.\n\nTable 2: Fluoride Content of Selected Foods [  3  ,  6  ,  7  ]  Food  |\nMilligrams per\nServing\n---|---\nTea, black, brewed, 1 cup  |  0.07 to 1.5*\nCoffee, brewed, 1 cup  |  0.22*\nShrimp, canned, 3 ounces  |  0.17\nBottled water with added fluoride, 1 cup  |  \u22640.17\nRaisins, \u00bc cup  |  0.08\nOatmeal, cooked, \u00bd cup  |  0.08*\nGrapefruit juice, \u00be cup  |  0.08\nPotatoes, russet, baked, 1 medium  |  0.08\nRice, cooked, \u00bd cup  |  0.04*\nCottage cheese, \u00bd cup  |  0.04\nPork chop, baked, 3 ounces  |  0.03\nYogurt, plain, low-fat, 1 cup  |  0.03\nLamb chop, cooked, 3 ounces  |  0.03\nTortilla, flour, 1 tortilla, approx. 10\" diameter  |  0.02\nCorn, canned, \u00bd cup  |  0.02\nBeef, cooked, 3 ounces  |  0.02\nTuna, light, canned in water, 3 ounces  |  0.02\nCheese, cheddar, 1\u00bd ounces  |  0.01\nBread, white or whole wheat, 1 slice  |  0.01\nAsparagus, cooked, 4 spears  |  0.01\nChicken, cooked, 3 ounces  |  0.01\nMilk, fat-free or 1%, 1 cup  |  0.01\nApple, raw, with skin, 1 medium  |  0.01\nAvocado, raw, \u00bd cup sliced  |  0.01\nMacaroni, plain, cooked, \u00bd cup  |  0.00*\nTomato, raw, 1 medium  |  0.00\nBanana, 1 medium  |  0.00\nEgg, cooked, 1 large  |  0.00\nCarrots, raw, 1 medium  |  0.00\nPeanut butter, 1 tbsp  |  0.00\n\n*Amounts of fluoride might vary by levels in the water used to prepare these foods and beverages.\n\n###  Fluoridated drinking water\n\nSince 1962, the U.S. Public Health Service has recommended the addition of\nfluoride to drinking (tap) water to reduce the risk and severity of dental\ncaries, one of the most common chronic diseases in children [  8  ]. Many\ncountries around the world now adjust the fluoride concentration of community\ndrinking water supplies to the level recommended for the prevention of dental\ncaries [  9  ].\n\nAlthough the U.S. Public Health Service recommended fluoride concentrations of\n0.7 in warmer climates (where children were expected to drink more water) to\n1.2 mg/L in cooler climates to prevent dental caries in 1962, it amended its\nrecommended level in 2015 to 0.7 mg/L to maintain the ability to prevent\ncaries while minimizing the risk of dental fluorosis [  8  ,  10  ]. In 1986,\nguidelines from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) established a\nmaximum allowable concentration of 4.0 mg/L fluoride in public drinking water\nsystems to prevent adverse effects from fluoride exposure (such as bone\ndisease) and a recommended maximum concentration of 2.0 mg/L to prevent dental\nfluorosis [  3  ,  11  ]. A review of this regulation is a currently a low\npriority for the EPA [  12  ].\n\nFluoridated municipal drinking water\u2014including water that people drink as well\nas foods and beverages prepared using municipal drinking water\u2014accounts for\nabout 60% of fluoride intakes in the United States [  3  ,  8  ]. In 2016,\n62.4% of the U.S. population had access to a fluoridated community water\nsystem [  13  ]. The fluoride additives used to fluoridate drinking water in\nthe United States are fluosilicic acid, sodium fluosilicate, and sodium\nfluoride [  14  ]. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has a\nwebpage that lists fluoride levels in tapwater by county: [\nhttps://nccd.cdc.gov/doh_mwf/Default/Default.aspx\n](https://nccd.cdc.gov/doh_mwf/Default/Default.aspx) [ ![external link\ndisclaimer](/images/Common/externallink.png) ](/About/exit_disclaimer.aspx\n\"External Website\") [  15  ]. Because of differences in amounts of fluoride in\ngroundwater, private water sources (including well water) have variable\nfluoride concentrations [  11  ].\n\nFluoride is not typically added to bottled drinking waters. However, when\nfluoride is added, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) stipulates that\nthe total amount of fluoride (added plus naturally occurring) cannot exceed\n0.7 mg/L [  7  ]. Previously allowable levels ranged from 0.8 to 1.7 mg/L. FDA\nnotes that this rule does not apply to bottled water without added fluoride\nthat contains fluoride naturally from its source water. The amount of fluoride\ncontained in bottled water is not required to be listed on the product label\nunless the label makes a claim about the product\u2019s fluoride content [  16  ].\n\n###  Dietary supplements\n\nOnly a few dietary supplements contain fluoride, usually in the form of sodium\nfluoride [  17  ]. Most of these products are multivitamin/mineral\nsupplements, multivitamins plus fluoride, or supplements containing trace\nminerals only. Some fluoride supplements, usually intended for children, are\nin the form of drops. The most common amount of fluoride in supplements is\n0.25 mg, although a few products contain 0.5 or 1 mg [  17  ].\n\n###  Dental products\n\nMost toothpaste sold in the United States contains fluoride in the form of\nsodium fluoride or monofluorophosphate, most commonly at a level of 1,000 to\n1,100 mg/L (about 1.3 mg in a quarter teaspoon, a typical amount of toothpaste\nused for one brushing) [  3  ]. The amount of fluoride ingested from\ntoothpaste depends on the amount used, the person\u2019s swallowing control, and\nhow often the person uses toothpaste. Estimated typical amounts of fluoride\ningested daily from toothpaste are 0.1 mg to 0.25 mg for infants and children\nage 0 to 5 years, 0.2 to 0.3 mg for children age 6\u201312 years, and 0.1 mg for\nadults [  3  ]. Fluoride in toothpaste, regardless of its form, is well\nabsorbed [  1  ].\n\nOther dental products that provide fluoride include mouth rinses for home use,\ntopical fluoride preparations applied in dentists\u2019 offices or through school-\nbased programs, and dental devices (e.g., orthodontic bracket adhesives,\nglass-ionomer and some composite resin dental restorative materials, and some\ndental sealants and cavity liners) [  3  ,  18  ]. Gels used by dentists are\ntypically applied one to four times a year and can lead to ingestions of 1.3\nto 31.2 mg fluoride each time; varnishes are least likely to produce a high\nbolus of fluoride [  3  ].\n\n###  Medications\n\nMedications can contain fluoride. For example, voriconazole (VFEND or Vfend)\nis an oral antifungal medication used to treat several infectious conditions,\nincluding invasive aspergillosis, candidemia, and candidiasis [  19  ].\nTypical doses of voriconazole provide 65 mg/day fluoride. Long-term use (e.g.,\nfor 4 months or more) of this medication can lead to high fluoride\nconcentrations in serum [  20  ,  21  ]. The prescribing information for\nvoriconazole advises discontinuation of voriconazole if skeletal fluorosis and\nperiostitis (inflammation of the membrane surrounding and protecting the\nbones) develop [  19  ].\n\n##  Fluoride Intakes and Status\n\nMost people in the United States consume adequate amounts of fluoride through\nfoods containing naturally occurring fluoride, fluoridated tap water, and food\nproducts made with fluoridated tap water. According to the EPA, typical daily\nfluoride intakes in the United States from foods and beverages (including\nfluoridated drinking water) are 1.2 to 1.6 mg for infants and toddlers younger\nthan 4 years, 2.0 to 2.2 mg for children age 4\u201311 years, 2.4 mg for those age\n11\u201314 years, and 2.9 mg for adults [  10  ].\n\n##  Fluoride and Health\n\nThis section focuses on two conditions in which fluoride might play a role:\ndental caries and bone fractures.\n\n###  Dental caries\n\nDental caries occurs when cariogenic bacteria in the mouth ferment foods and\nproduce acids that dissolve tooth mineral [  22  ]. Over time, this tooth\ndecay can cause pain and tooth loss. Without treatment, dental caries can\ncause infections, impair growth, lead to weight gain, affect school\nperformance, impair quality of life, and possibly result in death [  23-26  ].\nAdequate fluoride intakes reduce the risk of dental caries in its initial\nstages by inhibiting demineralization and the activity of bacteria in dental\nplaque and by enhancing tooth remineralization [  24  ].\n\n####  Impact of water fluoridation on dental caries\n\nWater fluoridation protects teeth in two main ways\u2014by preventing the\ndevelopment of caries through ingestion of drinking water during the tooth-\nforming years and through direct contact of fluoride with teeth throughout\nlife [  27  ,  28  ].\n\nA 2015 Cochrane Review included 20 prospective observational studies (most\nconducted before 1975) [  8  ]. The results showed that water fluoridation\nreduces the risk of decay and fillings, as well as of premature loss of\nprimary (baby) teeth, by 35% and loss of permanent (adult) teeth by 26% in\nchildren receiving fluoridated water in comparison with children receiving\nunfluoridated water. Fluoridation also increases the number of children with\nno decay in their baby teeth by 15% and the number of children with no decay\nin their permanent teeth by 14%. The authors concluded that water fluoridation\nis effective for reducing dental caries rates in both primary and permanent\nteeth in children. However, the reviewers were unable to assess the\neffectiveness of water fluoridation for preventing caries in adults because no\nevidence met the review\u2019s inclusion criteria (which required studies to\ninclude at least two groups, one receiving fluoridated water and one receiving\nunfluoridated water).\n\nThe Cochrane Review\u2019s findings were confirmed by a 2018 cross-sectional study\non the associations between fluoridated community water and dental caries in\nthe United States [  29  ]. The authors analyzed data on 7,000 children age 2\nto 8 years and 12,604 children and adolescents age 6 to 17 years who\nparticipated in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Study (NHANES)\nfrom 1999 to 2004 and 2011 to 2014, respectively. The results showed that\nliving in a county in which 75% or more of the drinking water contained at\nleast 0.7 mg/L fluoride was associated with a 30% reduction in the rate of\ncaries in primary teeth and a 12% reduction in the rate of caries in permanent\nteeth.\n\nSome evidence shows that the addition of fluoride to drinking water can also\nprevent dental caries in adults. An observational study included 3,779\nindividuals in Australia age 15 and older who participated in the Australian\n2004\u20132006 National Survey of Adult Oral Health [  30  ]. In adults exposed to\nfluoridated community water supplies for at least 14 years, rates of decayed,\nmissing, or filled teeth were 11%\u201312% lower than in adults whose drinking\nwater during this period had negligible amounts of fluoride. An earlier study\nin 876 Australian Defence Force members age 17\u201356 years found that the average\nrate of decayed, missing, and filled teeth was 24% lower in those with access\nto water containing 0.5 to 1 mg/L fluoride for at least half of their lifetime\nthan in those exposed for less than 10% of their lifetime [  31  ].\n\nThese findings show that fluoridated drinking water can prevent dental caries\nin children and adults.\n\n####  Impact of fluoride dietary supplements on dental caries in children\n\nSome studies have assessed the impact of fluoride supplements on caries\ndevelopment in children. For example, a 2011 Cochrane Review of 11 randomized\nor quasi-randomized studies in a total of 7,196 children (most living in\ncommunities lacking access to fluoridated drinking water) found that 0.25\u20131\nmg/day supplemental fluoride for 24\u201355 months reduced rates of decayed,\nmissing, and filled tooth surfaces by 24% [  32  ]. The authors concluded that\nfluoride supplements were associated with a lower caries incidence rate in\npermanent teeth. A 2013 systematic review found an even greater preventive\neffect of fluoride supplements on the basis of one randomized and four\nnonrandomized clinical trials in children [  25  ]. The results showed that\n0.25\u20131 mg/day fluoride supplementation reduced caries incidence rates in\nprimary teeth by 48%\u201372% in areas where water fluoridation levels were lower\nthan 0.6 mg/L. In two of these trials that monitored the children for 6\u201310\nyears, supplements were associated with a 33%\u201380% reduction in the incidence\nof caries at age 7\u201310 years.\n\nThe U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) and the American Dental\nAssociation have issued fluoride supplement recommendations for children whose\nwater supply contains little or no fluoride [  23  ]. These recommendations\nare summarized in Table 3.\n\nTable 3: Expert Panel Recommendations for Fluoride Supplementation in Children\nSource  |  Age Range  |  Recommendation\n---|---|---\nUSPSTF [  23  ]  |  6 months and older  |  \u2022 Fluoride supplement (dose not\nspecified) for children whose water supply contains little or no fluoride*\nAmerican Dental Association [  33  ]**  |  6 months to 3 years  |  \u2022 Fluoride\nsupplement (0.25 mg/day) for children whose water supply contains less than\n0.3 ppm (0.3 mg/L) fluoride\n|  3\u20136 years  |  \u2022 Fluoride supplement (0.5 mg/day) for children whose water\nsupply contains less than 0.3 ppm (0.3 mg/L) fluoride\n\u2022 Fluoride supplement (0.25 mg/day) for children whose water supply contains\n0.3 to 0.6 ppm (0.3 to 0.6 mg/L) fluoride\n|  6\u201316 years  |  \u2022 Fluoride supplement (1 mg/day) for children whose water\nsupply contains less than 0.3 ppm (0.3 mg/L) fluoride\n\u2022 Fluoride supplement (0.5 mg/day) for children whose water supply contains\n0.3 to 0.6 ppm (0.3 to 0.6 mg/L) fluoride\n\n*No studies have addressed the dosage or duration of oral fluoride supplementation in this population.\n**Recommended doses are based on poor-quality evidence.\n\nOverall, the available evidence suggests that dietary supplements containing\nfluoride can reduce rates of dental caries in children who lack access to\nfluoridated drinking water. No studies have assessed the impact of fluoride\nsupplements on caries development in adults.\n\n####  Fluoride dietary supplements in pregnant women\n\nLike other nutrients, fluoride is transferred from a pregnant woman to her\nfetus, so a few studies have evaluated the use of fluoride supplements by\npregnant women to prevent dental caries in their children. However, the\nauthors of a 2017 Cochrane Review found only one randomized controlled trial\npublished in 1997 that met the review\u2019s inclusion criteria [  34  ]. This\nstudy assessed caries rates in 798 3-year-old children whose mothers had\nreceived 1 mg/day fluoride during the last 6 months of pregnancy [  35  ]. The\nresults showed no significant difference in the proportions of children who\nhad decayed or filled primary tooth surfaces or who had caries. The authors of\nthe Cochrane Review concluded that the 1997 study was of very low quality and\nthat no evidence shows that fluoride supplementation in pregnant women\nprevents dental caries in their offspring.\n\n###  Bone fractures\n\nBecause fluoride helps stimulate the formation of new bone, researchers have\nhypothesized that fluoride supplements might reduce bone fracture risk.\nHowever, research to date has provided only limited evidence supporting this\nhypothesis [  36-38  ].\n\nThe findings of observational studies on the impact of fluoride levels in\nwater on bone mineral density (BMD) and fracture risk have been mixed. A study\nof 7,129 white women found no significant differences in bone mineral density\nor risk of hip, vertebral, wrist, or humerus fracture between those exposed\nand those not exposed to fluoridated water between 1950 and 1994 [  37  ]. In\ncontrast, in a study in 8,266 Chinese residents age 50 years or older, people\nwith access to water fluoride levels of approximately 1 mg/L had a lower\noverall risk of fractures, but not of hip fractures, than those with access to\nwater containing negligible fluoride levels [  38  ].\n\nClinical trials have also had conflicting findings about the efficacy of\nfluoride dietary supplements to prevent bone fractures. For example, a meta-\nanalysis of 25 randomized controlled trials in a total of 954 participants\n(four of the studies included people with osteoporosis) showed a significant\nreduction in vertebral and nonvertebral fracture risk with daily doses of up\nto 20 mg fluoride (in the form of monofluorophosphate or sodium fluoride), but\nnot with higher doses [  39  ]. A more recent randomized controlled trial\nfound that 2.5, 5, or 10 mg/day fluoride for 1 year in 180 postmenopausal\nwomen did not change BMD at any site assessed [  40  ].\n\n##  Health Risks from Excessive Fluoride\n\nLong-term ingestion of excess fluoride in infancy and childhood, when the\nteeth are being formed, can lead to dental fluorosis [  41  ]. The\ncharacteristics of this chronic condition usually vary from almost\nimperceptible white lines or flecks to white or brown stains on teeth [  2  ].\nSevere dental fluorosis can lead to pitting in tooth enamel. The risk of\ndental fluorosis increases with fluoride intakes above recommended amounts [\n42  ]. Severe enamel fluorosis is very rare, and no evidence indicates that\nrecommended levels of community water fluoridation lead to severe dental\nfluorosis [  3  ,  28  ].\n\nAnalysis of 1999\u20132004 NHANES data showed that 22.8% of persons age 6\u201349 had\ndental fluorosis, although less than 1% had severe fluorosis and less than 2%\nhad moderate fluorosis [  41  ]. The prevalence rate of dental fluorosis was\nhighest, 41%, in adolescents and lowest, 8.7%, in those age 40\u201349. A more\nrecent analysis of NHANES data in 2001\u20132002 and 2011\u20132012 found that rates of\ndental fluorosis (from very mild to severe) increased during this 10-year\nperiod, from 29.7% to 61.3% [  43  ].\n\nHigh doses of fluoride (typically from rare accidents resulting in excessively\nhigh levels of fluoridation of water, unintentional ingestion of fluoride\nproducts intended for topical use in dentists\u2019 offices, or fluoride\nsupplements inappropriately given to children) can result in nausea, vomiting,\nabdominal pain, diarrhea, periostitis, and even death in rare cases [  3  ,\n19  ,  44  ]. According to one estimate, the acute dose that could cause\nserious systemic toxicity for fluoride is 5 mg/kg (e.g., 375 mg for someone\nwho weighs 75 kg [165 pounds]) [  44  ]. This dose would be virtually\nimpossible to achieve from water or toothpaste containing standard levels of\nadded fluoride.\n\nChronic, excess intakes of fluoride are also associated with skeletal\nfluorosis, although this condition is extremely rare in the United States. Its\neffects can range from occasional joint pain or stiffness to osteoporosis,\nmuscle wasting, and neurological defects [  1  ,  45  ].\n\nIn addition to the potential to damage teeth and bones, some evidence suggests\nthat higher fluoride intakes during early development, including during\ngestation, might be associated with a lower IQ and other cognitive impairments\n(e.g., delays in cognitive development) in children [  46-49  ]. However, many\nexperts, including the authors of a National Academies of Sciences,\nEngineering, and Medicine review, consider this evidence to be weak and\nmethodologically flawed [  50-60  ].\n\nThe FNB has established ULs for fluoride from all sources for healthy\nindividuals (Table 4) based on levels associated with dental and skeletal\nfluorosis [  1  ].\n\nTable 4: Daily Tolerable Upper Intake Levels for\nFluoride [  1  ]  Age  |  Male  |  Female  |  Pregnancy  |  Lactation\n---|---|---|---|---\nBirth to 6 months  |  0.7 mg  |  0.7 mg  |  |\n7\u201312 months  |  0.9 mg  |  0.9 mg  |  |\n1\u20133 years  |  1.3 mg  |  1.3 mg  |  |\n4\u20138 years  |  2.2 mg  |  2.2 mg  |  |\n9\u201313 years  |  10 mg  |  10 mg  |  |\n14\u201318 years  |  10 mg  |  10 mg  |  10 mg  |  10 mg\n19\u201351 years  |  10 mg  |  10 mg  |  10 mg  |  10 mg\n51+ years  |  10 mg  |  10 mg  |  |\n\n##  Interactions with Fluoride\n\nFluoride has no known, clinically relevant interactions with medications [  61\n].\n\n##  Fluoride and Healthful Diets\n\nThe federal government's 2020\u20132025 _Dietary Guidelines for Americans_ notes\nthat \"Because foods provide an array of nutrients and other components that\nhave benefits for health, nutritional needs should be met primarily through\nfoods. ... In some cases, fortified foods and dietary supplements are useful\nwhen it is not possible otherwise to meet needs for one or more nutrients\n(e.g., during specific life stages such as pregnancy).\"\n\nFor more information about building a healthy dietary pattern, refer to the _[\nDietary Guidelines for Americans ](https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov) [\n![external link disclaimer](/images/Common/externallink.png)\n](/About/exit_disclaimer.aspx \"External Website\") _ and the U.S. Department of\nAgriculture's _[ MyPlate. ](https://www.choosemyplate.gov/) [ ![external link\ndisclaimer](/images/Common/externallink.png) ](/About/exit_disclaimer.aspx\n\"External Website\") _\n\nThe _Dietary Guidelines for Americans_ describes a healthy dietary pattern as\none that\n\n* Includes a variety of vegetables; fruits; grains (at least half whole grains); fat-free and low-fat milk, yogurt, and cheese; and oils.\n* Includes a variety of protein foods such as lean meats; poultry; eggs; seafood; beans, peas, and lentils; nuts and seeds; and soy products.\n* Limits foods and beverages higher in added sugars, saturated fat, and sodium.\n* Limits alcoholic beverages.\n* Stays within your daily calorie needs.\n\n##  References\n\n1.

    "content": "\nThe handicap principle is a disputed hypothesis proposed by the Israeli biologist Amotz Zahavi in 1975. It is meant to explain how sexual selection may lead to \"honest\" or reliable signalling between male and female animals which have an obvious motivation to bluff or deceive each other. The handicap principle suggests that secondary sexual characteristics are costly signals which must be reliable, as they cost the signaller resources that individuals with less of a particular trait could not afford. The handicap principle further proposes that animals of greater biological fitness signal this through handicapping behaviour, or morphology that effectively lowers overall fitness. The central idea is that sexually selected traits function like conspicuous consumption, signalling the ability to afford to squander a resource. Receivers then know that the signal indicates quality, because inferior-quality signallers are unable to produce such wastefully extravagant signals.\nThe handicap principle is supported by game theory modelling representing situations such as nestlings begging for food, predator-deterrent signalling, and threat displays. However, honest signals are not necessarily costly, undermining the theoretical basis for the handicap principle, which remains unconfirmed by empirical evidence.\n\nHistory[edit]\nOrigins[edit]\nThe handicap principle was proposed in 1975 by the Israeli biologist Amotz Zahavi. He argued that  sexual selection may lead to \"honest\" or reliable signalling between male and female animals, even though they have an interest in bluffing or deceiving each other. The handicap principle asserts that secondary sexual characteristics are costly signals, which are reliable indicators of the signaller's quality, since they cost the signaller resources that lower-quality individuals could not afford. The generality of the phenomenon is a matter of some debate and disagreement, and Zahavi's views on the scope and importance of handicaps in biology have not been accepted by the mainstream. Nevertheless, the idea has been very influential, with most researchers in the field believing that the theory explains some aspects of animal communication.\nGrafen's signaling game model[edit]\nFurther information: Signaling game\nGraph based on Johnstone's 1997 graphical representation of a Zahavian handicap. Where \n\n\n\n\nC\n\nL\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle C_{L}}\n\n is cost to a low-quality signaller and \n\n\n\n\nC\n\nH\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle C_{H}}\n\n is cost to a high-quality signaller. Optimal signalling levels are \n\n\n\n\nS\n\nL\n\n\n\u2217\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle S_{L}^{*}}\n\n for a low-quality signaller, and \n\n\n\n\nS\n\nH\n\n\n\u2217\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle S_{H}^{*}}\n\n for a high-quality signaller.\nThe handicap principle was initially controversial; The British biologist John Maynard Smith was a notable early critic of Zahavi's ideas.\nHowever, the handicap principle gained wider acceptance because it is supported by game theory models, most notably the Scottish biologist Alan Grafen's signalling game model. This was essentially a rediscovery of the Canadian-American economist Michael Spence's job market signalling model, where the job applicant signals their quality by declaring a costly education. In Grafen's model, the courting male's quality is signalled by investment in an extravagant trait\u2014similar to the peacock's tail. The signal is reliable if the cost to the signaller of producing it is proportionately lower for higher-quality signallers than for lower-quality ones.\nA series of papers by the American biologist Thomas Getty showed that Grafen's proof of the handicap principle depends on the critical, simplifying assumption that signallers trade off costs for benefits in an additive fashion, analogous to the way humans invest money to increase income in the same currency. This is illustrated in the figures from Johnstone 1997, which show that the optimum signalling levels are different for low- and high-quality signallers. The validity of the assumption that costs and benefits are additive has been contested, in its application to the evolution of sexually selected signals. It can be reasoned that since fitness depends on the production of offspring, this is a multiplicative rather than additive function of reproductive success.\nFurther game theoretical models demonstrated the evolutionary stability of handicapped signals in nestlings' begging calls, in predator-deterrent signals and in threat-displays. In the classic handicap models of begging in game theory, all players are assumed to pay the same amount to produce a signal of a given level of intensity, but differ in the relative value of eliciting the desired response (donation) from the receiver. The hungrier the baby bird, the more food is of value to it, and the higher the optimal signalling level (the louder its chirping).\nCheap talk models[edit]\n\nFurther information: Cheap talk\nCounter-examples to handicap models predate handicap models themselves. Models of signals (such as threat displays) without any handicapping costs show that what biologists call cheap talk may be an evolutionarily stable form of communication. Analysis of some begging models shows that non-communication strategies are not only evolutionarily stable, but lead to higher payoffs for both players. In human mate choice, mathematical analyses including Monte Carlo simulations suggest that costly traits ought to be more attractive to the other sex and much rarer than non-costly traits.\nIt was soon discovered that honest signals need not be costly at the honest equilibrium, even under conflict of interest. This conclusion was first shown in discrete models and then in continuous models. Similar results were obtained in conflict models: threat displays need not be handicaps to be honest and evolutionarily stable.\nDustin J. Penn and Szabolcs Sz\u00e1mad\u00f3 stated in 2019 that there was still no empirical evidence for evolutionary pressure for wasteful biology or acts, and proposed that the handicap principle should be abandoned.\n\nPredictions and interpretations[edit]\nLuxury cars and other \"Veblen goods\" may be an example of the handicap principle in humans\nThe handicap principle predicts that a sexual ornament, or any other signal such as visibly risky behavior, must be costly if it is to accurately advertise a trait of relevance to an individual with conflicting interests. Typical examples of handicapped signals include bird songs, the peacock's tail, courtship dances, and bowerbird bowers. American scientist Jared Diamond has proposed that certain risky human behaviours, such as bungee jumping, may be expressions of instincts that have evolved through the operation of the handicap principle. Zahavi has invoked the gift-giving potlatch ceremony as a human example of the handicap principle in action: the conspicuous generosity is costly. This interpretation of potlatch can be traced to Thorstein Veblen's use of the ceremony in his book Theory of the Leisure Class as an example of \"conspicuous consumption\".\nThe handicap principle gains further support by providing interpretations for behaviours that fit into a single unifying gene-centered view of evolution and making earlier explanations based on group selection obsolete. A classic example is that of stotting in gazelles. This behaviour consists in the gazelle initially running slowly and jumping high when threatened by a predator such as a lion or cheetah. The explanation based on group selection was that such behaviour might be adapted to alerting other gazelle to a cheetah's presence or might be part of a collective behaviour pattern of the group of gazelle to confuse the cheetah. Instead, Zahavi proposed that each gazelle was communicating that it was a fitter individual than its fellows.\nSignals to members of the same species[edit]\nZahavi studied in particular the Arabian babbler, a highly social bird, with a life-length of 30 years, which appears to behave altruistically. Its helping-at-the-nest behavior, where non-parent birds assist in feeding, guarding, and caring for nestlings, often occurs among unrelated individuals. This, therefore, cannot be explained by kin selection, natural selection acting on genes that close relatives share with the altruistic individual. Zahavi reinterpreted these behaviors according to his signalling theory and its correlative, the handicap principle. The altruistic act is costly to the donor, but may improve its attractiveness to potential mates. The evolution of this condition may be explained by competitive altruism.\nFrench biologist Patrice David showed that in the stalk-eyed fly species Cyrtodiopsis dalmanni, genetic variation underlies the response to environmental stress, such as variable food quality, of a male sexual ornament, eye span. He showed that some male genotypes always develop large eye spans, but others reduce eye span in proportion to environmental worsening. David inferred that female mate choice yields genetic benefits for offspring.\nSignals to other species[edit]\n\nFurther information: Anti-predator adaptation\nImpala stotting, a behavior that may serve as a pursuit deterrence signal to predators\nSignals may be directed at predators, with the function of showing that pursuit will probably be unprofitable. Stotting, for instance, is a form of energetic jumping that certain gazelles do when they sight a predator. As this behavior gives no evident benefit and would seem to waste resources (diminishing the gazelle's head start if chased by the predator), it appeared likely to be selected against. However, it made sense when seen as a pursuit deterrence signal to predators. By investing a little energy to show a lion that it has the fitness necessary to avoid capture, a gazelle reduces the likelihood that it will have to evade the lion in an actual pursuit. The lion, faced with the demonstration of fitness, might decide that it would fail to catch this gazelle, and thus choose to avoid a probably wasted pursuit. The benefit to the gazelle is twofold. First, for the small amount of energy invested in the stotting, the gazelle might not have to expend the tremendous energy required to evade the lion. Second, if the lion is in fact capable of catching this gazelle, the gazelle's bluff may lead to its survival that day (in the event the bluff succeeds). However, the mathematical biologist John Maynard Smith commented that other explanations were possible, such as that it was an honest signal of fitness, or an honest signal that the predator had been detected, and it was hard to see how stotting could be a handicap.\nAnother example is provided by larks, some of which discourage merlins by sending a similar message: they sing while being chased, telling their predator that they will be difficult to capture.\nImmunocompetence handicaps[edit]\nThe theory of immunocompetence handicaps suggests that androgen-mediated traits accurately signal condition due to the immunosuppressive effects of androgens.  This immunosuppression may be either because testosterone alters the allocation of limited resources between the development of ornamental traits and other tissues, including the immune system, or because heightened immune system activity has a propensity to launch autoimmune attacks against gametes, such that suppression of the immune system enhances fertility. Healthy individuals can afford to suppress their immune system by raising their testosterone levels, at the same time augmenting secondary sexual traits and displays. A review of empirical studies into the various aspects of this theory found weak support.\n\nSee also[edit]\nAposematism\nMultiple sexual ornaments\nParasite-stress theory\nSacrifice"

There are numerous studies demonstrating that a small amount of fluoride delivered to the oral cavity decreases the prevalence of dental decay and results in stronger teeth and bones. However, ingestion of fluoride more than the recommended limit leads to toxicity and adverse effects. In order to update our understanding of fluoride and its potential toxicity, we have described the mechanisms of fluoride metabolism, toxic effects, and management of fluoride toxicity. The main aim of this review is to highlight the potential adverse effects of fluoride overdose and poorly understood toxicity. In addition, the related clinical significance of fluoride overdose and toxicity has been discussed.\n\nKeywords: Fluoridation, Fluoride, Oral health, Toxicity, Water fluoridation\nGo to:\nIntroduction\nFluoride is the 13th most abundant element present in the earth\u2019s crust. It belongs to the halogen group of elements and is found naturally in water, soil, animals, and plants (1). Fluoride is one of the most reactive and ubiquitously present in nature. It is present in trace amounts in all mineralized tissues of the body such as enamel, dentin, and bone. Fluoride is involved in a number of enzymatic reactions (2). In mineralized tissues and biomaterials, fluoride ions increase the stability of mineralized tissues and materials by decreasing the solubility of hydroxy-apatite mineral phase present in biomaterials and mineralized tissues (3). The protective effects of fluoride on dental health were first observed in 1930 as there was less tooth decay in communities consuming naturally fluoridated water compared to non-fluoridated areas (4). Due to these beneficial effects of fluoride, it was introduced into dentistry in 1940 and since then, it is being added to various consumer products. Water fluoridation is the most successfully adopted method (5-7). Fluoride delivery methods and related sources of dietary fluoride are:\n\nFluoridated water, beverages, and tea. Water is an important media for fluoride delivery. Fluoride exists either naturally or added during water fluoridation (8-11). Recommended optimal level of fluoride in drinking water is 0.7 mg/l; however, fluoride concentration in water varies based on geographical areas. For instance, fluoride content in drinking waters of Pakistan shows a large variation that ranges from < 0.1 ppm to >3 ppm (12). Another study demonstrated that natural water from certain geographical areas (e.g. Punjab, Pakistan) contains fluoride concentration of up to 21 ppm (13). Therefore, the data suggests a clear need for the careful selection of fluoride products to avoid toxic effects of fluoride (12).\n\nFluoride containing dentifrices such as tooth-paste, professionally used varnishes/gels, and mouth rinses. Fluoride tooth pastes are available as low fluoride (500 ppm), standard fluoride (1100-1500 ppm) and high fluoride toothpaste (>1500 ppm). Fluoride is added in different forms to toothpastes and mouth rinses such as sodium fluoride (NaF), mono-fluorophosphate (MFP), or stannous fluoride (SnF) (14, 15). The mouth rinses have an advantage over toothpastes because of their low viscosity that results in better delivery to least accessible areas of the teeth such as pits and fissures and interproximal areas (7, 16, 17).\n\nFluoridated milk including formula milk for infants and table salt fluoridation (7, 17). Fluoride delivery through milk fluoridation is not efficient as compared to other fluoride delivery methods. This is due to fluoride\u2019s tendency to form insoluble complexes with calcium, which makes fluoride absorption difficult.\n\na) Fluoride releasing dental materials. Some of these biomaterials not only release fluoride but also have a property to recharge them with fluoride once fluoride from other sources is available into the oral cavity. Commonly available fluoride releasing mate-rials are glass ionomer cements (GICs), dental resin composites, compomers (modified dental composites), silicate cement, giomers, elastomeric rings and fluoride delivering mucoadhesive devices (18-21).\n\nThe suggestive mechanisms for the beneficial effects of fluoride include following mechanisms (22).\n\na) Fluorapatite (FA) formation on tooth surface by substitution of hydroxyl with fluoride ion in the hydroxyapatite (HA). FA decreases the solubility of HA and makes the dental enamel more resistant to dissolution from the acid that is produced by the pathogenic bacteria.\n\nb) Inhibition of enzyme enolase, which results in a reduction in lactic acid formation.\n\nEven though the beneficial effects of fluoride on dental health are well-established, it is very crucial to regulate the amount of fluoride intake. In addition to naturally or artificially fluoridated water, fluoride is available in a number of dental products and materials as mentioned earlier. Therefore, fluoride consumption at elevated levels may lead to a range of detrimental effects. The aim of this review is to highlight the potential adverse effects of fluoride overdose and poorly understood toxicity. In addition, the related clinical significance of fluoride overdose and toxicity has been discussed.\n\nFluoride absorption, metabolism, and excretion\nFluoride is consumed commonly through the oral cavity and absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract. Other less common routes of fluoride absorp-tion are inhalation and dermal absorption (23, 24). The principal sources of fluoride are fluoridated water and fluoride containing dental products.\n\nThe absorption of fluoride starts through the stomach and upper part of the small intestine (1, 25). In the stomach, the absorption of fluoride depends on the pH of the stomach while in the small intestine fluoride absorption is pH independent and absorp-tion is through facilitated diffusion (26). Fluoride absorption depends on numerous factors such as stomach pH, the chemical formula of consumed fluoride, presence of food in the stomach, interaction with other food ingredients present in gastrointestinal tract, aluminum, calcium, and magnesium compounds (23). The unabsorbed fluoride is defecated through feces while the absorbed fluoride is distributed rapidly through the circulation into the intracellular and extracellular fluids and is retained only in the mineralized tissues of the body.\n\nThe fluoride uptake by mineralized tissues is more efficient in growing children and progressively declines with age. Retention of fluoride in the mineralized tissues of the body is reversible; fluoride is released back slowly when the fluoride level in plasma falls (25, 27). Fluoride in the plasma is capable of crossing the placenta and is found in placental and fetal tissues. The placenta plays a regulatory role by the accumulation of excess fluoride, which protects the fetal tissues from excess fluoride intake (25). Absorbed fluoride is deposited from serum into mineralized tissues while the remaining is excreted primarily into the urine and to a lesser extent into feces, sweat, saliva, and breast milk. The excretion of fluoride through the urinary system depends upon several factors like plasma levels of fluoride, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), pH of the urine, and its flow (25, 28). The summary of the fluoride absorption, metabolism, and excretion is summarized in Figure 1.\n\nAn external file that holds a picture, illustration, etc.\nObject name is IJBMS-20-841-g001.jpg\nFigure 1\nSummary of absorption, metabolism, and excretion of fluoride following oral intake\n\nToxic effects of fluoride\nExcessive ingestion of fluoride may cause toxic and harmful effects. It is important to note that the major source of fluoride toxicity remains oral hygiene products. According to fluoride poisoning data collected by the American Association of Poison Control (AAPC), tooth paste ingestion remains the main source of toxicity followed by fluoride containing mouth washes and supplements (Table 1). The highest proportion (more than 80%) of the cases of fluoride toxicity was reported in children below the age of 6 (29).\n\nTable 1\nPercentage of reported cases of fluoride toxicity (29)\n\nCause of fluoride toxicity\tPercentage of cases\nToothpaste\t68%\nMouth rinses\t17%\nFluoride supplements\t15%\nOpen in a separate window\nThese reported toxicities are due to the fact that the swallowing reflex in children is not completely developed and fluoride toothpastes are flavored, which results in voluntary toothpaste swallowing (30). Alternatively, a variety of flavors added to toothpastes may inspire young children to ingest it. Chewing stick (miswak) is another option that is natural and there are no reports of fluoride toxicity from miswak (31). The optimum beneficial dose of fluoride and the fluoride minimal risk levels are summarized in Table 2. These given doses are based on limited data reported in the literature and even at lower than the mentioned doses there are reports of toxic and lethal effects.\n\nTable 2\nSummary of the important doses of fluoride (29, 30, 32)\n\nImportant doses of fluoride\nOptimal dose of fluoride (for children & adults)\t0.05 - 0.07 mg F/kg body weight\nToxic dose of fluoride (for children & adults)\t5 mg F/kg body weight\nLethal dose of fluoride (children)\t16 mg F/kg body weight\nLethal dose of fluoride (adults)\t32 mg F/kg body weight\nOpen in a separate window\nThe possible mechanisms of fluoride toxicity are (29):\n\n(a) As the fluoride comes in contact with mois ture this results in the formation of hydrofluoric acid and this acid formation results in burning of tissues due to low pH.\n(b) Inhibition of nerve impulse or nerve function is due to the fact that calcium forms chemical complexes with fluoride leading to hypocalcemia and ultimately results in inhibition of physiological nerve functioning.\n(c) Cellular poisoning results due to inhibition of enzymes required for the physiological functioning of cells.\n(d) Hypocalcemia and hyperkalemia result in elec-trolyte imbalance and eventually result in distur-bances in cardiac rhythm.\n(e) Fluoride is one of the most reactive elements. In the case of a toxic amount of fluoride in the body, fluoride attacks oxygen and disrupt the metabolism resulting in the production of hydrogen peroxide as a product. In addition, fluoride results in excessive production of free radicles that disrupt the antioxidant formation (23).\nThe toxicity of fluoride due to excessive ingestion is classified into acute toxic effects and chronic effects (Figure 2).\n\nAn external file that holds a picture, illustration, etc.\nObject name is IJBMS-20-841-g002.jpg\nFigure 2\nClassification of toxic effects due to excessive ingestion of fluoride\n\nAcute toxic effects\nAcute fluoride poisoning although occasionally reported, however, may be fatal. Acute fluoride toxicity usually occurs due to the accidental consumption of fluoride solution or fluoride salts wrongly perceived as sugar solution or powdered eggs (33). The symptoms of acute fluoride toxicity depend upon the type and chemical nature of the ingested compound, the age, and the elapsed time between exposure and the beginning of management (34). For instance, NaF is more toxic as it is more soluble and releases more amounts of fluoride compared to calcium fluoride (CaF) that is a less soluble compound (28). The acute toxic dose range is 5-8 mg/kg body weight. In the case of acute fluoride toxicity, one or a combination of the following symptoms such as gastric disturbances (nausea, vomiting occasionally with blood, abdominal pain, diarrhea, weakness, and hypocalcemia) are observed. These symptoms result in generalized or localized muscle tetany especially of hand and feet. In addition, hypotension, bronchospasm, fixed and dilated pupils, and hyperkalemia are also linked with fluoride toxicity, which may result in ventricular arrhythmias and cardiac arrest. Loss of body fluid contributes to an electrolyte imbalance, a state of hypovolemic shock, and decreased blood pressure. Acute fluoride poisoning may induce in some individuals a polyuria resembling diabetes insipidus, which may persist for days to months. In a few instances, the acute polyuric renal failure has terminated fatally (33). A progressive, mixed metabolic and respiratory acidosis may develop because of the failure of renal and respiratory systems, coma and convulsions terminating in death (28, 29).\n\nChronic toxic effects\nChronic toxicity of fluoride is more common than acute toxicity. The effects of chronic ingestion of fluoride depend not only on the duration and dose but also on several other factors such as nutritional status, renal function, and interactions with other trace elements (24, 28).\n\nDental fluorosis\nThe association between excessive ingestion of fluoride and dental mottling (fluorosis) was initially discovered over a century ago by Frederick Sumner McKay a practicing dentist in Colorado Springs area and G. V. Black (22). Dental fluorosis is the most sensitive and the earliest indicator of chronic fluoride toxicity (1). Although fluoride is an impor-tant element for caries prevention, the chronic intake of fluoride greater than 1 mg/l or 0.1 mg/kg daily during the period of tooth development interferes with the process of enamel and dentin formation and leads to dental fluorosis (1, 35, 36).\n\nThe mechanism of dental fluorosis is very complex and not fully understood. The excess amount of fluoride impedes normal enamel maturation and the dental enamel formed is hypomineralized with more surface and subsurface porosity in comparison with normal enamel. In dentine due to excessive fluoride during dentin formation, the dentinal tubules have an irregular distribution and the lumina of the tubules become narrow and disrupted (36, 37). Clinically, the appea-rance ranges from mild opaque white to brown mottling of enamel associated with pits and enamel fracture in both deciduous and permanent dentitions, and the lesions are generally symmetrical bilaterally (28, 38, 39). The severity of dental fluorosis not only depends on excessive consumption of fluoride but also on the timing and duration of excessive fluoride consumption, the plasma concentration of fluoride, type of fluoride consumed, renal function, and genetic factors (36).\n\nTherefore, in order to prevent fluorosis the following measures should be instituted:\n\nThe fluoride level in the drinking water should be regulated between 0.5 to 1 ppm as suggested by the World Health Organization (5).\nLow fluoride dentifrices (500 ppm) are indicated for children living in fluoridated areas (35).\nSupervised brushing and a smear layer of low fluoride toothpaste should be applied on the brush (40).\nFollowing these precautionary measurements, the chances of fluorosis and related lesions will be reduced.\n\nSkeletal fluorosis\nChronic fluoride exposure at more than the recommended levels either by ingestion, inhalation, or a combination of both results in skeletal fluorosis. This condition is characterized by an increase in bone mass and density because of deposition of excess fluoride within the bone matrix (24). The primary phase of skeletal fluorosis is associated with symptoms such as sporadic pain, joints stiffness due to fluoride deposition with resultant difficulty in mobility, kyphosis of back bone, tingling sensation, muscle weakness, and fatigue. The advanced stage of skeletal fluorosis is linked with signs of arthritis and osteoporosis in long bones, spinal cord compression and calcification of ligaments with resulting neuro-logical defects and muscle wasting (41).\n\nRadiographically, skeletal fluorosis may appear as osteosclerosis and calcification of ligaments (24, 27, 42, 43). The neurological symptoms that occur because of fluoride toxicity are due to abnormal bone outgrowths (1). Primary symptoms of skeletal fluorosis usually occur in fluoride doses greater than 4 mg/l. While the crippling skeletal fluorosis is rare and is associated with intake of water with fluoride level greater than 10 mg/l, it results in a remarkable limitation of joint movements, and deformities of major joints and spine leading to neurological problems (10, 27, 28). The severity of skeletal fluorosis depends on the amount of water intake, quality of water, renal disease, and dietary factors for instance calcium rich diet, which has a protective effect and prevents toxic effects of fluoride on bones (1, 27).\n\nRenal effects\nThe kidney is the major organ that has a major role in fluoride excretion (50-60% excretion). It is the most commonly affected organ due to the uptake of fluoride within the kidney tubules (24). A prolonged exposure to concentrated fluoridated drinking water (8 ppm or higher) has been reported to increase renal diseases due to structural and functional changes in the kidney (23, 41). Structural changes due to fluoride toxicity include swelling, degeneration of tubular epithelium, fibrosis, atrophy of glomeruli, and tubular necrosis. All these structural changes result in increased serum creatinine and urea nitrogen (41).\n\nGastrointestinal tract (GIT)\nHigh concentration fluoride reacts chemically with gastric acid (hydrochloric acid) in the stomach to form hydrogen fluoride. Gastric mucosa is irritated by this excessive formation of hydrofluoric acid (6). Non-ulcer dyspeptic symptoms have been observed in populations consuming high fluoride concentration (3.2 ppm) water. Animal studies reveal that fluoride has a potential to stimulate the secretion of gastric acids, diminish blood supply away from the stomach lining, and may result in the death of epithelial cells of GIT. The fluoride ingestion required to elicit such responses in humans could not be documented. For instance, adverse GIT symptoms are common in areas of endemic fluorosis where nutrition is generally poor or the individuals have gastrointestinal hypersensitivities (27).\n\nCentral nervous system\nFluoride can cross the blood brain barrier prior to birth and has been reported to affect mental development, learning disorders, and decrease intelligence and hyperactivity in children. In fetal brain, the levels of the neurotransmitters and the number of receptors are also reported to decrease in endemic fluoride areas (41). In addition, fluoride results in degenerative changes in neural tissues. These changes might account for neurological alterations (such as numbness, pain, and muscle spasm) and decreased memory and learning ability of the experimental animals (44). These neurological changes due to fluoride toxicity may be exacerbated by the deficiency of some other essential elements, for example, iodine or toxicity of other neurotoxic pollutants (41). A few studies have suggested that ingestion of dietary fluoride influences the intellectual capabilities of children. Children inges-ting high levels of fluoride (>2 mg/l) scored more poorly on intelligence tests compared with children ingesting lower amounts of fluoride (<1 mg/l). In addition, fluoride influences the reaction times and visuospatial capabilities, hence lowering the IQ scores during the time sensitive tests (27).\n\nFetal defects\nFluoride crosses the placental barrier and incorporates into the fetal tissues. This may lead to teratogenic effects. In addition, elevated fluoride exposures may result in disturbances in bone ossification (6). The genotoxic effects of fluoride are due to an aberration in chromosomes (41). These findings are suggestive of toxic effects of fluoride to fetal tissues hence extreme care required while prescribing to pregnant women. Any accidental ingestion of high amounts of dentifrices can lead to harmful effects on the fetus (45). The fetal brain is also susceptible to fluoride poisoning. Fluoride effects the fetal brain tissues and results in remark-able neurological damage, neuronal degeneration, and reduced secretion of neurotransmitters such as norepinephrine. In addition, fluoride disrupts the secretion of certain neurotransmitters and nerve cell receptors and results in neural dysplasia (46).\n\nTable 3\nSummary of treatment protocol for fluoride overdose (48)\n\nFluoride/kilogram body weight*\tTreatment\n< 5.0 mg/kg\n1.Oral administration of soluble calcium (milk) to relieve GIT symptoms\n2.Observe for a few hours\n3.Induced vomiting not required\n> 5 mg/kg\n1.Require hospital admission\n2.Use emetic to empty the stomach.

Key harmful effects are summarized below:\n\nI. Fluoride level (greater than 3 ppm) affects the reproductive system resulting in a decrease in mean birth rates (6). In animal models, the male reproductive system is more susceptible to chronic fluoride toxicity because of the production of free radicals that result in histological and structural changes in the reproductive system that disturb sperm production and sexual functions (41, 47).\n\nII. Higher fluoride level affects thyroid function due to rise in calcitonin activity. Excess fluoride also results in decreased glucose tolerance (1, 6).\n\nIII. Chronic fluoride toxicity adversely affects both cell mediated and humoral immunity, for instance, it destroys the white cell energy reservoirs that are required for phagocytosis of foreign agents and by inhibition of antibody formation (41).\n\nAll the above-reported toxicities may also be a result of the presence of heavy metals and other substances present in fluoridation chemicals added during fluoridation of water or related dental products. Therefore, it is important to purify fluoride from heavy metals and any impurities before adding it to the drinking water or other fluoride containing products (22).\n\nBasis of the treatment\nThe management of fluoride toxicity consists of: i. The fluoride toxicity case must be evaluated immediately for the type and amount of ingested fluoride. The minimum optimal dose likely to cause toxicity and requiring therapeutic intervention has been set at 5 mg/kg of body weight. Regarding the chemical type, NaF and hydrogen fluoride are more soluble, resulting in faster absorption. On the other hand, CaF and magnesium fluoride are the less soluble fluoride compounds and absorption may be relatively slow (29).\n\nii. Milk has a proven role in reducing the absorption of fluoride (rich in calcium which has a fluoride binding effect). Further absorption can be minimized using, calcium gluconate, calcium lactate, or milk of magnesia and aluminum, which form insoluble complexes that decrease the absorption of fluoride. Therefore, calcium containing compounds are used in acute fluoride toxicity (25,40). Gastric lavage is recommended instead of an emetic agent because of the danger of aspiration of gastric contents and burning of the esophagus due to hydrofluoric acid present in the stomach (40).\n\niii. Alkalization of the body fluids results in the faster removal of the ingested fluoride from the body fluids because of the faster flux of fluoride out of the cells and its elimination into the urine (25).\n\niv. Supporting the vital signs by oxygen therapy, artificial respiration, and hemodialysis are highly recommended. These measures should be continued until the stabilization of vital signs and serum chemistry (25).\n\nGo to:\nConclusion\nThe beneficial role of fluoride for the maintenance of good oral health has been known for many decades and strongly evidenced by scientific research. However, it must be emphasized that tooth decay (dental caries) is not caused by fluoride deficiency and fluoride supplementation will never reverse the active or gross carious lesions. Since the level of safety of fluoride is low, products that contain a high level of fluoride should be stored and used according to the recommend-dation and should be monitored by a qualified dental professional especially in children and pregnant women. In children, the swallowing reflex is not very well developed and the fluoride containing dental products are flavored hence increasing the possibility of a child to consume an excessive dose of fluoride. In areas with high fluoride levels in the drinking water, alternative dental products with low fluoride levels should be prescribed and monitored.\n\nGo to:\nAcknowledgment\nWe are grateful to Prof SM Kefi Iqbal, Dean Sindh Institute of Oral Health Sciences, Jinnah Sindh Medical University, Karachi, Pakistan for his valuable suggestions and guidance for the completion of this manuscript.

agent\n](/wiki/Chemical_agent \"Chemical agent\") that affects the body by being\nabsorbed into the [ blood ](/wiki/Blood \"Blood\") .  [1]  Blood agents are\nfast-acting, potentially lethal poisons that typically manifest at room\ntemperature as volatile colorless gases with a faint odor.  [1]  They are\neither [ cyanide ](/wiki/Cyanide \"Cyanide\") \\- or [ arsenic ](/wiki/Arsenic\n\"Arsenic\") -based.  [1]\n\n##  Exposure  [  [ edit\n](/w/index.php?title=Blood_agent&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit section:\nExposure\") ]\n\nBlood agents work through [ inhalation ](/wiki/Inhalation \"Inhalation\") or [\ningestion ](/wiki/Ingestion \"Ingestion\") .  [2]  As [ chemical weapons\n](/wiki/Chemical_weapon \"Chemical weapon\") , blood agents are typically\ndisseminated as [ aerosols ](/wiki/Aerosol \"Aerosol\") and take effect through\ninhalation. Due to their [ volatility ](/wiki/Volatility_\\(chemistry\\)\n\"Volatility \\(chemistry\\)\") , they are more toxic in confined areas than in\nopen areas.  [1]\n\n[ Cyanide ](/wiki/Cyanide \"Cyanide\") compounds occur in small amounts in the\nnatural environment and in [ cigarette smoke ](/wiki/Cigarette_smoke\n\"Cigarette smoke\") . They are also used in several industrial processes and as\npesticides. Cyanides are released when [ synthetic fabrics\n](/wiki/Synthetic_fabric \"Synthetic fabric\") or [ polyurethane\n](/wiki/Polyurethane \"Polyurethane\") burn, and may thus contribute to fire-\nrelated deaths.  [2]  [ Arsine ](/wiki/Arsine \"Arsine\") gas, formed when [\narsenic ](/wiki/Arsenic \"Arsenic\") encounters an acid, is used as a pesticide\nand in the semiconductor industry; most exposures to it occur accidentally in\nthe workplace.  [2]\n\n##  Symptoms  [  [ edit\n](/w/index.php?title=Blood_agent&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit section:\nSymptoms\") ]\n\nThe symptoms of blood agent poisoning depend on concentration and duration.\n\nCyanide-based blood agents irritate the eyes and the [ respiratory tract\n](/wiki/Respiratory_tract \"Respiratory tract\") , while arsine is\nnonirritating.  [2]  [ Hydrogen cyanide ](/wiki/Hydrogen_cyanide \"Hydrogen\ncyanide\") has a faint, bitter, almond odor that only about half of all people\ncan smell. Arsine has a very faint garlic odor detectable only at greater than\nfatal concentrations.  [1]\n\nExposure to small amounts of cyanide has no effect.  [2]  Higher\nconcentrations cause dizziness, weakness and nausea, which cease with the\nexposure, but long-time exposure can cause mild symptoms followed by permanent\nbrain damage and muscle paralysis.  [2]  Moderate exposure causes stronger and\nlonger-lasting symptoms, including headache, that can be followed by\nconvulsions and coma. Stronger or longer exposure will also lead to\nconvulsions and coma. Very strong exposure causes severe toxic effects within\nseconds, and rapid death.  [2]\n\nThe blood of people killed by blood agents is bright red, because the agents\ninhibit the use of the oxygen in it by the body's cells.  [2]  Cyanide\npoisoning can be detected by the presence of [ thiocyanate ](/wiki/Thiocyanate\n\"Thiocyanate\") or cyanide in the blood, a smell of [ bitter almonds\n](/wiki/Bitter_almond \"Bitter almond\") , or respiratory tract inflammations\nand congestions in the case of [ cyanogen chloride ](/wiki/Cyanogen_chloride\n\"Cyanogen chloride\") poisoning.  [2]  There is no specific test for arsine\npoisoning, but it may leave a garlic smell on the victim's breath.  [2]\n\n##  Effects  [  [ edit  ](/w/index.php?title=Blood_agent&action=edit&section=3\n\"Edit section: Effects\") ]\n\nMain article: [ Cyanide poisoning ](/wiki/Cyanide_poisoning \"Cyanide\npoisoning\")\n\nAt sufficient concentrations, blood agents can quickly saturate the blood and\ncause death in a matter of minutes or seconds.  [2]  They cause powerful\ngasping for breath, violent convulsions and a painful death that can take\nseveral minutes.  [2]  The immediate [ cause of death ](/wiki/Cause_of_death\n\"Cause of death\") is usually [ respiratory failure ](/wiki/Respiratory_failure\n\"Respiratory failure\") .  [2]\n\nBlood agents work at the [ cellular level ](/wiki/Cell_\\(biology\\) \"Cell\n\\(biology\\)\") by preventing the exchange of [ oxygen ](/wiki/Oxygen \"Oxygen\")\nand [ carbon dioxide ](/wiki/Carbon_dioxide \"Carbon dioxide\") between the\nblood and the body's cells. This causes the cells to suffocate from lack of\noxygen.  [2]  Cyanide-based agents do so by interrupting the [ electron\ntransport chain ](/wiki/Electron_transport_chain \"Electron transport chain\")\nin the inner membranes of [ mitochondria ](/wiki/Mitochondria \"Mitochondria\")\n. Arsine damages the [ red blood cells ](/wiki/Red_blood_cell \"Red blood\ncell\") which deliver oxygen throughout the body.  [2]\n\n##  Detection and countermeasures  [  [ edit\n](/w/index.php?title=Blood_agent&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit section:\nDetection and countermeasures\") ]\n\nChemical detection methods, in the form of kits or testing strips, exist for\nhydrogen cyanide. Ordinary clothing provides some protection, but proper\nprotective clothing and masks are recommended. Mask filters containing only\ncharcoal are ineffective, and effective filters are quickly saturated.  [3]\n\nDue to their high volatility, cyanide agents generally need no\ndecontamination. In enclosed areas, fire extinguishers spraying [ sodium\ncarbonate ](/wiki/Sodium_carbonate \"Sodium carbonate\") can decontaminate\nhydrogen cyanide, but the resulting metal salts remain poisonous on contact.\n[3]  Liquid hydrogen cyanide can be flushed with water.  [4]\n\nCyanide poisoning can be [ treated with antidotes\n](/wiki/Cyanide_poisoning#Antidote \"Cyanide poisoning\") .\n\n##  List of blood agents  [  [ edit\n](/w/index.php?title=Blood_agent&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit section: List of\nblood agents\") ]\n\nThe information in the following table, which lists blood agents of military\nsignificance,  [3]  is taken from Ledgard.  [5]  The values given are on a\nscale from 1 to 10.\n\nAgent  |  Description  |  Melting / boiling point  |  Effectiveness as blood\nagent  |  Persistence, open area  |  Persistence, enclosed area  |  Field\nstability  |  Storage stability  |  Toxicity as blood agent\n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---\n[ Hydrogen cyanide ](/wiki/Hydrogen_cyanide \"Hydrogen cyanide\") |  Colorless\ngas or liquid, almond odor, burns with a bluish flame.  |  \u221213 / 26 \u00b0C  |  10\n|  2  |  9  |  10  |  8  |  10\n[ Cyanogen ](/wiki/Cyanogen \"Cyanogen\") |  Colorless gas, almond odor, burns\nwith a pinkish flame having a blue border.  |  \u221228 / \u221221 \u00b0C  |  9  |  2  |  9\n|  8  |  7  |  9\n[ Cyanogen chloride ](/wiki/Cyanogen_chloride \"Cyanogen chloride\") |\nColorless gas or liquid, pungent and biting odor, soluble in water and\nalcohol.  |  \u22126 / 14 \u00b0C  |  8  |  3  |  9  |  9  |  9  |  8\n[ Cyanogen bromide ](/wiki/Cyanogen_bromide \"Cyanogen bromide\") |  Colorless\nneedle-shaped or cubic crystals, tending to volatilize on standing, hence of\nlimited usefulness as a weapon.  |  52 / 62 \u00b0C  |  9  |  5  |  8  |  5  |  6\n|  8\n[ Arsine ](/wiki/Arsine \"Arsine\") |  Colorless gas, garlic-like odor, slightly\nsoluble in water.  |  \u2212117 / \u221262 \u00b0C  |  9  |  3  |  8  |  5  |  9  |  9\n[ Vinyl arsine ](/w/index.php?title=Vinyl_arsine&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Vinyl\narsine \\(page does not exist\\)\") |  Colorless liquid, irritating and bitter\nodor, slightly soluble in water, also acts as a [ blister agent\n](/wiki/Blister_agent \"Blister agent\") .  |  124 \u00b0C (boiling)  |  7  |  7  |\n9  |  8  |  9  |  6\n[ Phosgene ](/wiki/Phosgene \"Phosgene\") |  Colorless gas and slightly yellow\nliquid, moldy hay odor, slightly soluble in water and soluble in most\nsolvents, also acts as a [ choking agent ](/wiki/Choking_agent \"Choking\nagent\") .  |  \u2212118 / 8  |  10  |  6  |  9  |  5  |  8  |  6\n\n[ Sodium cyanide ](/wiki/Sodium_cyanide \"Sodium cyanide\") and [ potassium\ncyanide ](/wiki/Potassium_cyanide \"Potassium cyanide\") , colorless crystalline\ncompounds similar in appearance to sugar, also act as blood agents.  [2]  [\nCarbon monoxide ](/wiki/Carbon_monoxide \"Carbon monoxide\") could technically\nbe called a blood agent because it binds with oxygen-carrying hemoglobin in\nthe blood (see [ carbon monoxide poisoning ](/wiki/Carbon_monoxide_poisoning\n\"Carbon monoxide poisoning\") ), but its high volatility makes it impractical\nas a chemical warfare agent.  [6]\n\nOne of the earliest proposed chemical weapons, [ cacodyl oxide\n](/wiki/Cacodyl_oxide \"Cacodyl oxide\") , or [ Cadet's fuming liquid\n](/wiki/Cadet%27s_fuming_liquid \"Cadet's fuming liquid\") , also displays\nproperties of a blood agent (as well as those of a malodorant). It was\nproposed as a chemical weapon in [ the British Empire\n](/wiki/The_British_Empire \"The British Empire\") during the [ Crimean War\n](/wiki/Crimean_War \"Crimean War\") , along with the significantly more potent\nblood agent, [ cacodyl cyanide ](/wiki/Cacodyl_cyanide \"Cacodyl cyanide\") .\n[7]\n\n##  Use  [  [ edit  ](/w/index.php?title=Blood_agent&action=edit&section=6\n\"Edit section: Use\") ]\n\nThe most significant practical application of blood agents was the use of [\nhydrogen cyanide ](/wiki/Hydrogen_cyanide \"Hydrogen cyanide\") ( [ Zyklon B\n](/wiki/Zyklon_B \"Zyklon B\") ) in [ gas chambers ](/wiki/Gas_chambers \"Gas\nchambers\") by [ Nazi Germany ](/wiki/Nazi_Germany \"Nazi Germany\") to commit\nthe mass murder of Jews and others in the course of [ the Holocaust\n](/wiki/The_Holocaust \"The Holocaust\") .  [8]  This resulted in the largest\ndeath toll as a result of the use of chemical agents to date.

    "content": "Vertigo is a condition in which a person has the sensation of movement or of surrounding objects moving when they are not. Often it feels like a spinning or swaying movement. It may be associated with nausea, vomiting, perspiration, or difficulties walking. It is typically worse when the head is moved. Vertigo is the most common type of dizziness.\nThe most common disorders that result in vertigo are benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease, and vestibular neuritis. Less common causes include stroke, brain tumors, brain injury, multiple sclerosis, migraines, trauma, and uneven pressures between the middle ears. Physiologic vertigo may occur following being exposed to motion for a prolonged period such as when on a ship or simply following spinning with the eyes closed. Other causes may include toxin exposures such as to carbon monoxide, alcohol, or aspirin. Vertigo typically indicates a problem in a part of the vestibular system. Other causes of dizziness include presyncope, disequilibrium, and non-specific dizziness.\nBenign paroxysmal positional vertigo is more likely in someone who gets repeated episodes of vertigo with movement and is otherwise normal between these episodes. Benign vertigo episodes generally last less than one minute. The Dix-Hallpike test typically produces a period of rapid eye movements known as nystagmus in this condition. In M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease there is often ringing in the ears, hearing loss, and the attacks of vertigo last more than twenty minutes. In vestibular neuritis the onset of vertigo is sudden, and the nystagmus occurs even when the person has not been moving. In this condition vertigo can last for days. More severe causes should also be considered, especially if other problems such as weakness, headache, double vision, or numbness occur.\nDizziness affects approximately 20\u201340% of people at some point in time, while about 7.5\u201310% have vertigo. About 5% have vertigo in a given year. It becomes more common with age and affects women two to three times more often than men. Vertigo accounts for about 2\u20133% of emergency department visits in the developed world.\n\nClassification[edit]\nVertigo is classified into either peripheral or central depending on the location of the dysfunction of the vestibular pathway, although it can also be caused by psychological factors.\nVertigo can also be classified into objective, subjective, and pseudovertigo. Objective vertigo describes when the person has the sensation that stationary objects in the environment are moving. Subjective vertigo refers to when the person feels as if they are moving. The third type is known as pseudovertigo, an intensive sensation of rotation inside the person's head. While this classification appears in textbooks, it is unclear what relation it has to the pathophysiology or treatment of vertigo.\nPeripheral[edit]\nVertigo that is caused by problems with the inner ear or vestibular system, which is composed of the semicircular canals, the vestibule (utricle and saccule), and the vestibular nerve is called \"peripheral\", \"otologic\", or \"vestibular\" vertigo. The most common cause is benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), which accounts for 32% of all peripheral vertigo. Other causes include M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease (12%), superior canal dehiscence syndrome, vestibular neuritis, and visual vertigo. Any cause of inflammation such as common cold, influenza, and bacterial infections may cause transient vertigo if it involves the inner ear, as may chemical insults (e.g., aminoglycosides) or physical trauma (e.g., skull fractures). Motion sickness is sometimes classified as a cause of peripheral vertigo.\nPeople with peripheral vertigo typically present with mild to moderate imbalance, nausea, vomiting, hearing loss, tinnitus, fullness, and pain in the ear. In addition, lesions of the internal auditory canal may be associated with facial weakness on the same side. Due to a rapid compensation process, acute vertigo as a result of a peripheral lesion tends to improve in a short period of time (days to weeks).\nCentral[edit]\nVertigo that arises from injury to the balance centers of the central nervous system (CNS), often from a lesion in the brainstem or cerebellum, is called \"central\" vertigo and is generally associated with less prominent movement illusion and nausea than vertigo of peripheral origin. Central vertigo may have accompanying neurologic deficits (such as slurred speech and double vision), and pathologic nystagmus (which is pure vertical/torsional). Central pathology can cause disequilibrium, which is the sensation of being off balance. The balance disorder associated with central lesions causing vertigo is often so severe that many people are unable to stand or walk.\nA number of conditions that involve the central nervous system may lead to vertigo including:  lesions caused by infarctions or hemorrhage, tumors present in the cerebellopontine angle such as a vestibular schwannoma or cerebellar tumors, epilepsy, cervical spine disorders such as cervical spondylosis, degenerative ataxia disorders, migraine headaches, lateral medullary syndrome, Chiari malformation, multiple sclerosis, parkinsonism, as well as cerebral dysfunction. Central vertigo may not improve or may do so more slowly than vertigo caused by disturbance to peripheral structures. Alcohol can result in positional alcohol nystagmus (PAN).\n\nSigns and symptoms[edit]\nA drawing showing the sensation of vertigo\nVertigo is a sensation of spinning while stationary. It is commonly associated with nausea or vomiting, unsteadiness (postural instability), falls, changes to a person's thoughts, and difficulties in walking. Recurrent episodes in those with vertigo are common and frequently impair the quality of life. Blurred vision, difficulty in speaking, a lowered level of consciousness, and hearing loss may also occur. The signs and symptoms of vertigo can present as a persistent (insidious) onset or an episodic (sudden) onset.\nPersistent onset vertigo is characterized by symptoms lasting for longer than one day and is caused by degenerative changes that affect balance as people age. Nerve conduction slows with aging, and a decreased vibratory sensation is common as a result. Additionally, there is a degeneration of the ampulla and otolith organs with an increase in age. Persistent onset is commonly paired with central vertigo signs and symptoms.\nThe characteristics of an episodic onset vertigo are indicated by symptoms lasting for a smaller, more memorable amount of time, typically lasting for only seconds to minutes.\n\nPathophysiology[edit]\nThe neurochemistry of vertigo includes six primary neurotransmitters that have been identified between the three-neuron arc that drives the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR). Glutamate maintains the resting discharge of the central vestibular neurons and may modulate synaptic transmission in all three neurons of the VOR arc. Acetylcholine appears to function as an excitatory neurotransmitter in both the peripheral and central synapses. Gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) is thought to be inhibitory for the commissures of the medial vestibular nucleus, the connections among the cerebellar Purkinje cells, the lateral vestibular nucleus, and the vertical VOR.\nThree other neurotransmitters work centrally. Dopamine may accelerate vestibular compensation. Norepinephrine modulates the intensity of central reactions to vestibular stimulation and facilitates compensation. Histamine is present only centrally, but its role is unclear. Dopamine, histamine, serotonin, and acetylcholine are neurotransmitters thought to produce vomiting. It is known that centrally acting antihistamines modulate the symptoms of acute symptomatic vertigo.\n\nDiagnosis[edit]\nTests for vertigo often attempt to elicit nystagmus and to differentiate vertigo from other causes of dizziness such as presyncope, hyperventilation syndrome, disequilibrium, or psychiatric causes of lightheadedness. Tests of vestibular system (balance) function include electronystagmography (ENG), Dix-Hallpike maneuver, rotation tests, head-thrust test, caloric reflex test, and computerized dynamic posturography (CDP).\nThe HINTS test, which is a combination of three physical examination tests that may be performed by physicians at the bedside, has been deemed helpful in differentiating between central and peripheral causes of vertigo. The HINTS test involves the horizontal head impulse test, observation of nystagmus on primary gaze, and the test of skew. CT scans or MRIs are sometimes used by physicians when diagnosing vertigo.\nTests of auditory system (hearing) function include pure tone audiometry, speech audiometry, acoustic reflex, electrocochleography (ECoG), otoacoustic emissions (OAE), and the auditory brainstem response test.\nA number of specific conditions can cause vertigo. In the elderly, however, the condition is often multifactorial.\nA recent history of underwater diving can indicate a possibility of barotrauma or decompression sickness involvement, but does not exclude all other possibilities. The dive profile (which is frequently recorded by dive computer) can be useful to assess a probability for decompression sickness, which can be confirmed by therapeutic recompression.\nBenign paroxysmal positional vertigo[edit]\nBenign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is the most common vestibular disorder and occurs when loose calcium carbonate debris has broken off of the otoconial membrane and enters a semicircular canal thereby creating the sensation of motion. People with BPPV may experience brief periods of vertigo, usually under a minute, which occur with change in the position.\nThis is the most common cause of vertigo. It occurs in 0.6% of the population yearly with 10% having an attack during their lifetime. It is believed to be due to a mechanical malfunction of the inner ear. BPPV may be diagnosed with the Dix-Hallpike test and can be effectively treated with repositioning movements such as the Epley maneuver.\nM\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease[edit]\n\nFurther information: M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease\nM\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease is an inner ear disorder of unknown origin, but is thought to be caused by an increase in the amount of endolymphatic fluid present in the inner ear (endolymphatic hydrops). However, this idea has not been directly confirmed with histopathologic studies, but electrophysiologic studies have been suggestive of this mechanism. M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease frequently presents with recurrent, spontaneous attacks of severe vertigo in combination with ringing in the ears (tinnitus), a feeling of pressure or fullness in the ear (aural fullness), severe nausea or vomiting, imbalance, and hearing loss. As the disease worsens, hearing loss will progress.\nVestibular neuritis[edit]\nVestibular neuritis presents with severe vertigo with associated nausea, vomiting, and generalized imbalance and is believed to be caused by a viral infection of the inner ear, although several theories have been put forward and the cause remains uncertain. Individuals with vestibular neuritis do not typically have auditory symptoms, but may experience a sensation of aural fullness or tinnitus. Persisting balance problems may remain in 30% of people affected.\nVestibular migraine[edit]\nVestibular migraine is the association of vertigo and migraines and is one of the most common causes of recurrent, spontaneous episodes of vertigo. The cause of vestibular migraines is currently unclear; however, one hypothesized cause is that the stimulation of the trigeminal nerve leads to nystagmus in individuals with migraines. Approximately 40% of all migraine patients will have an accompanying vestibular syndrome, such as vertigo, dizziness, or disruption of the balance system.\nOther suggested causes of vestibular migraines include the following: unilateral neuronal instability of the vestibular nerve, idiopathic asymmetric activation of the vestibular nuclei in the brainstem, and vasospasm of the blood vessels supplying the labyrinth or central vestibular pathways resulting in ischemia to these structures. Vestibular migraines are estimated to affect 1\u20133% of the general population and may affect 10% of people with migraine . Additionally, vestibular migraines tend to occur more often in women and rarely affect individuals after the sixth decade of life.\nMotion sickness[edit]\nMotion sickness is common and is related to vestibular migraine. It is nausea and vomiting in response to motion and is typically worse if the journey is on a winding road or involves many stops and starts, or if the person is reading in a moving car. It is caused by a mismatch between visual input and vestibular sensation. For example, the person is reading a book that is stationary in relation to the body, but the vestibular system senses that the car, and thus the body, is moving.\nAlternobaric vertigo[edit]\n\nMain article: Alternobaric vertigo\nAlternobaric vertigo is caused by a pressure difference between the middle ear cavities, usually due to blockage or partial blockage of one eustachian tube, usually when flying or diving underwater. It is most pronounced when the diver is in the vertical position; the spinning is toward the ear with the higher pressure and tends to develop when the pressures differ by 60\u00a0cm of water or more.\nDecompression sickness[edit]\n\nFurther information: Decompression sickness\nVertigo is recorded as a symptom of decompression sickness in 5.3% of cases by the U.S. Navy as reported by Powell, 2008 including isobaric decompression sickness.\nDecompression sickness can also be caused at a constant ambient pressure when switching between gas mixtures containing different proportions of different inert gases. This is known as isobaric counterdiffusion, and presents a problem for very deep dives. For example, after using a very helium-rich trimix at the deepest part of the dive, a diver will switch to mixtures containing progressively less helium and more oxygen and nitrogen during the ascent. Nitrogen diffuses into tissues 2.65 times slower than helium, but is about 4.5 times more soluble. Switching between gas mixtures that have very different fractions of nitrogen and helium can result in \"fast\" tissues (those tissues that have a good blood supply) increasing their total inert gas loading. This is often found to provoke inner ear decompression sickness, as the ear seems particularly sensitive to this effect.\nStroke[edit]\nA stroke (either ischemic or hemorrhagic) involving the posterior fossa is a cause of central vertigo. Risk factors for a stroke as a cause of vertigo include increasing age and known vascular risk factors. Presentation may more often involve headache or neck pain, additionally, those who have had multiple episodes of dizziness in the months leading up to presentation are suggestive of stroke with prodromal TIAs. The HINTS exam as well as imaging studies of the brain (CT, CT angiogram, MRI) are helpful in diagnosis of posterior fossa stroke.\nVertebrobasilar insufficiency[edit]\nVertebrobasilar insufficiency, notably Bow Hunter's syndrome, is a rare cause of positional vertigo, especially when vertigo is triggered by rotation of the head.\n\nManagement[edit]\nDefinitive treatment depends on the underlying cause of vertigo. People with M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease have a variety of treatment options to consider when receiving treatment for vertigo and tinnitus including: a low-salt diet and intratympanic injections of the antibiotic gentamicin or surgical measures such as a shunt or ablation of the labyrinth in refractory cases.\nCommon drug treatment options for vertigo may include the following:\nAnticholinergics such as hyoscine hydrobromide (scopolamine)\nAnticonvulsants such as topiramate or valproic acid for vestibular migraines\nAntihistamines such as betahistine, dimenhydrinate, or meclizine, which may have antiemetic properties\nBeta blockers such as metoprolol for vestibular migraine\nCorticosteroids such as methylprednisolone for inflammatory conditions such as vestibular neuritis or dexamethasone as a second-line agent for M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease\nAll cases of decompression sickness should be treated initially with 100% oxygen until hyperbaric oxygen therapy (100% oxygen delivered in a high-pressure chamber) can be provided. Several treatments may be necessary, and treatment will generally be repeated until either all symptoms resolve, or no further improvement is apparent.\n\nEtymology[edit]\nVertigo is from the Latin word, vert\u014d, which means \"a whirling or spinning movement\".\n\nSee also[edit]\nAcrophobia\u00a0\u2013 Extreme fear of heights\nBroken escalator phenomenon\u00a0\u2013 Illusion when stepping onto a broken escalator\nChronic subjective dizziness\u00a0\u2013 Type of dizziness (chronic functional vestibular disorder)Pages displaying wikidata descriptions as a fallback\nFear of falling\u00a0\u2013 Natural fear typical of most mammals\nHead for heights\nIdeomotor phenomenon\u00a0\u2013 Concept in hypnosis and psychological research\nIllusions of self-motion\u00a0\u2013 Misperception of one's location or movement\nProprioception\u00a0\u2013 Sense of self-movement, force, and body position\nMotion sickness\u00a0\u2013 Nausea caused by motion or perceived motion\nSense of balance, also known as Equilibrioception\u00a0\u2013 Physiological sense regarding posture\nSpatial disorientation\u00a0\u2013 Inability of a person to correctly determine their body position in space"

    "content": "The mutation accumulation theory of aging was first proposed by Peter Medawar in 1952 as an evolutionary explanation for biological aging and the associated decline in fitness that accompanies it. Medawar used the term 'senescence' to refer to this process. The theory explains that, in the case where harmful mutations are only expressed later in life, when reproduction has ceased and future survival is increasingly unlikely, then these mutations are likely to be unknowingly passed on to future generations. In this situation the force of natural selection will be weak, and so insufficient to consistently eliminate these mutations. Medawar posited that over time these mutations would accumulate due to genetic drift and lead to the evolution of what is now referred to as aging.\n\nBackground and history[edit]\nDespite Charles Darwin's completion of his theory of biological evolution in the 19th century, the modern logical framework for evolutionary theories of aging wouldn't emerge until almost a century later. Though August Weismann did propose his theory of programmed death, it was met with criticism and never gained mainstream attention. It wasn't until 1930 that Ronald Fisher first noted the conceptual insight which prompted the development of modern aging theories. This concept, namely that the force of natural selection on an individual decreases with age, was analysed further by J. B. S. Haldane, who suggested it as an explanation for the relatively high prevalence of Huntington's disease despite the autosomal dominant nature of the mutation. Specifically, as Huntington's only presents after the age of 30, the force of natural selection against it would have been relatively low in pre-modern societies. It was based on the ideas of Fisher and Haldane that Peter Medawar was able to work out the first complete model explaining why aging occurs, which he presented in a lecture in 1951 and then published in 1952\n\nMechanism of action[edit]\n(a) The survival rate within a population decreases with age, while the reproduction rate remains constant. (b) The reproduction probability peaks early in life, at sexual maturity, and then steadily decreases as an individual ages, with the remaining share of the population decreasing with age as they enter the selection shadow.\nAmongst almost all populations, the likelihood that an individual will reproduce is related directly to their age. Starting at 0 at birth, the probability increases to its maximum in young adulthood once sexual maturity has been reached, before gradually decreasing with age. This decrease is caused by the increasing likelihood of death due to external pressures such as predation or illness, as well as the internal pressures inherent to organisms that experience senescence. In such cases deleterious mutations which are expressed early on are strongly selected against due to their major impact on the number of offspring produced by that individual. Mutations that present later in life, by contrast, are relatively unaffected by selective pressure, as their carriers have already passed on their genes, assuming they survive long enough for the mutation to be expressed at all. The result, as predicted by Medawar, is that deleterious late-life mutations will accumulate and result in the evolution of aging as it is known colloquially. This concept is portrayed graphically by Medawar through the concept of a \"selection shadow\". The shaded region represents the 'shadow' of time during which selective pressure has no effect. Mutations that are expressed within this selection shadow will remain as long as reproductive probability within that age range remains low.\n\nEvidence supporting the mutation accumulation theory[edit]\nPredation and Delayed Senescence[edit]\nIn populations where extrinsic mortality is low, the drop in reproductive probability after maturity is less severe than in other cases. The mutation accumulation theory therefore predicts that such populations would evolve delayed senescence. One such example of this scenario can be seen when comparing birds to organisms of equivalent size. It has been suggested that their ability to fly, and therefore lower relative risk of predation, is the cause of their longer than expected life span. The implication that flight, and therefore lower predation, increases lifespan is further born out by the fact that bats live on average 3 times longer than similarly sized mammals with comparable metabolic rates. Providing further evidence, insect populations are known to experience very high rates of extrinsic mortality, and as such would be expected to experience rapid senescence and short life spans. The exception to this rule, however, is found in the longevity of eusocial insect queens. As expected when applying the mutation accumulation theory, established queens are at almost no risk of predation or other forms of extrinsic mortality, and consequently age far more slowly than others of their species.\nAge-specific reproductive success of Drosophila Melanogaster[edit]\nIn the interest of finding specific evidence for the mutation accumulation theory, separate from that which also supports the similar antagonistic pleiotropy hypothesis, an experiment was conducted involving the breeding of successive generations of Drosophila Melanogaster. Genetic models predict that, in the case of mutation accumulation, elements of fitness, such as reproductive success and survival, will show age-related increases in dominance, homozygous genetic variance and additive variance. Inbreeding depression will also increase with age. This is because these variables are proportional to the equilibrium frequencies of deleterious alleles, which are expected to increase with age under mutation accumulation but not under the antagonistic pleiotropy hypothesis. This was tested experimentally by measuring age specific reproductive success in 100 different genotypes of Drosophila Melanogaster, with findings ultimately supporting the mutation accumulation theory of aging.\n\nCriticisms of the mutation accumulation theory[edit]\nUnder most assumptions, the mutation accumulation theory predicts that mortality rates will reach close to 100% shortly after reaching post-reproductive age. Experimental populations of Drosophila Melanogaster, and other organisms, however, exhibit age-specific mortality rates that plateau well before reaching 100%, making mutation accumulation alone an insufficient explanation. It is suggested instead that mutation accumulation is only one factor among many, which together form the cause of aging. In particular, the mutation accumulation theory, the antagonistic pleiotropy hypothesis and the disposable soma theory of aging are all believed to contribute in some way to senescence."

The work provides new insight into how we learn and\nremember our real-world experiences.\n\n\u201cLots of prior research has shown that learning and memory benefit from\nspacing study sessions out,\u201d said [ Benjamin Rottman\n](https://www.psychology.pitt.edu/people/benjamin-m-rottman-phd) , an\nassociate professor of psychology and director of the Causal Learning and\nDecision-Making Lab at Pitt. \u201cFor example, if you cram the night before a\ntest, you might remember the information the next day for the test, but you\nwill probably forget it fairly soon. In contrast, if you study the material on\ndifferent days leading up to the test, you will be more likely to recall it\nfor a longer period of time.\u201d\n\nThis \u201cspacing effect\u201d is one of the most replicated findings in psychological\nresearch, but much of that work has been predicated on the idea that what you\nare trying to learn repeats identically each time. Yet that is rarely the case\nin real life, when some features of our experiences may stay the same while\nothers are likely to change.\n\nFor example, imagine repeat trips to your local coffee shop. You might see the\nsame tables, seats and decorations, but a new barista may be serving you. It\u2019s\nnot clear that the spacing effect would work the same way in the face of such\nchanges.\n\nIn two experiments, the researchers asked participants to repeatedly study\npairs of items and scenes that were either identical on each repetition or\nwhere the item stayed the same, but the scene changed each time.\n\nOne of the experiments asked participants to learn these pairings and then\ntest their memory via their smartphones \u2014 an unusual approach for learning and\nmemory research. This enabled researchers to ask participants to learn pairs\nat various times of the day across 24 hours, more accurately representing how\npeople actually learn information than in prior lab experiments.\n\nIn the second experiment, researchers collected data online in a single\nsession. The team [ published their results\n](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2311077121) in the March 12 online\nedition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\n\nThe setup allowed the team to study the effects of memorizing both across\ndifferent timescales and the content of what\u2019s being memorized, explained [\nEmily Cowan ](https://sites.temple.edu/adaptivememorylab/people/) , lead\nauthor on the paper and a postdoctoral fellow in Temple\u2019s Adaptive Memory Lab.\n\u201cWith this, we were able to ask how memory is impacted both by what is being\nlearned \u2014 whether that is an exact repetition or instead, contains variations\nor changes \u2014 as well as when it is learned over repeated study opportunities.\u201d\n\nAs in prior experiments, researchers found that spaced learning helped\nparticipants remember the items. But they also found the participants\u2019 memory\nwas better for the items that had been paired with different scenes compared\nto items shown with the same scene repeatedly. For example, if you want to\nremember a new person\u2019s name, repeating the name but associating it with\ndifferent information about the person can be helpful.\n\nOn the other hand, Rottman said, stability appeared to aid the type of memory\nthat pairs items and scenes. \u201cSpacing only benefited memory for the pairs that\nwere repeated exactly, and only if there were pretty long gaps, hours to days,\nbetween study opportunities,\u201d he said. \u201cFor example, if you are trying to\nremember the new person\u2019s name and something about them, like their favorite\nfood, it is more helpful to repeat that same exact name-food pairing multiple\ntimes with spacing between each.\u201d\n\nThe Pitt-Temple experiments represent basic memory research, and so the\nresearch may not necessarily apply to some types of real-world memorizing\ntasks. \u201cBecause of how nuanced memory is, it is hard to provide clear advice\nfor things like studying for a test because the sort of material can be so\ndifferent,\u201d Rottman said. \u201cBut in theory our findings should be broadly\nrelevant to different sorts of tasks, like remembering someone\u2019s name and\nthings about them, studying for a test and learning new vocabulary in a\nforeign language.\u201d\n\nCowan continued: \u201cOur work suggests that both variability and spacing may\npresent methods to improve our memory for isolated features and associative\ninformation, respectively, raising important applications for future research,\neducation and our everyday lives.\u201d\n\nIn addition to Cowan and Rottman, study investigators included Vishnu \u201cDeepu\u201d\nMurty, principal investigator of Temple\u2019s Adaptive Memory Lab, and Yiwen\nZhang, a graduate student in cognitive psychology at Pitt.\n\n_\u2014 Bruce Steele, photography by Tom Altany_\n\nThis research was funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation (grant number\n1651330) and the National Institutes of Health (grant

    "content": "Darkness is defined as a lack of illumination, an absence of visible light, or a surface that absorbs light, such as a black one.\nHuman vision is unable to distinguish colors in conditions of very low luminance because the hue-sensitive photoreceptor cells on the retina are inactive when light levels are insufficient, in the range of visual perception referred to as scotopic vision.\nThe emotional response to darkness has generated metaphorical usages of the term in many cultures, often used to describe an unhappy or foreboding feeling.\n\"Darkness\" may also refer to night, which occurs when the Sun is more than 18\u00b0 below the horizon.\n\nScientific[edit]\nPerception[edit]\nThe perception of darkness differs from the mere absence of light due to the effects of after images on perception. In perceiving, the eye is active, and the part of the retina that is unstimulated produces a complementary afterimage.\nPhysics[edit]\n\nSee also: Light and Heat death of the universe\nIn terms of physics, an object is said to be dark when it absorbs photons, causing it to appear dim compared to other objects.  For example, matte black paint does not reflect much visible light and appears dark, whereas white paint reflects much light and appears bright. For more information, see color. An object may appear dark, but it may be bright at a frequency that humans cannot perceive.\nA dark area has limited light sources, making things hard to see. Exposure to alternating light and darkness (night and day) has caused several evolutionary adaptations to darkness.  When a vertebrate, like a human, enters a dark area, its pupils dilate, allowing more light to enter the eye and improving night vision. Also, the light detecting cells in the human eye (rods and cones) will regenerate more unbleached rhodopsin when adapting to darkness.\nOne scientific measure of darkness is the Bortle scale, which indicates the night sky's and stars' brightness at a particular location, and the observability of celestial objects at that location.\nThe material known as Vantablack is one of the darkest substances known, absorbing up to 99.965% of visible light (at 663\u00a0nm if the light is perpendicular to the material), and was developed by Surrey NanoSystems in the United Kingdom. The name is a compound of the acronym VANTA (vertically aligned nanotube arrays) and the color black.\nTechnical[edit]\nThe color of a point, on a standard 24-bit computer display, is defined by three RGB (red, green, blue) values, each ranging from 0\u2013255. When the red, green, and blue components of a pixel are fully illuminated (255,255,255), the pixel appears white; when all three components are unilluminated (0,0,0), the pixel appears black.\n\nCultural[edit]\nArtistic[edit]\nCaravaggio's The Calling of St Matthew uses darkness for its chiaroscuro effects.\n\nMain article: Tints and shades\nThis section has multiple issues.

Darkness can be used as a counterpoint to areas of lightness to create leading lines and voids. Such shapes draw the eye around areas of the painting. Shadows add depth and perspective to a painting. See chiaroscuro for a discussion of the uses of such contrasts in visual media.\nColor paints are mixed together to create darkness, because each color absorbs certain frequencies of light. Theoretically, mixing together the three primary colors, or the three secondary colors, will absorb all visible light and create black. In practice, it is difficult to prevent the mixture from taking on a brown tint.\nLiterature[edit]\nSeparation of light and darkness on the first day of creation, from the Sistine Chapel ceiling by Michelangelo\n\nFurther information: Light and darkness\nAs a poetic term in the Western world, darkness is used to connote the presence of shadows, evil, and foreboding, or in modern parlance, to connote that a story is grim, heavy, and/or depressing.\nReligion[edit]\nThe first creation narrative in Judaism and Christianity begins with darkness, into which is introduced the creation of light, and the separation of this light from the darkness (as distinct from the creation of the Sun and Moon on the fourth day of creation). Thus, although both light and darkness are included in the comprehensive works of God, darkness was considered \"the second to last plague\" (Exodus 10:21), and the location of \"weeping and gnashing of teeth\" (Matthew 8:12).\nErebus was a primordial deity in Greek mythology, representing the personification of darkness.\nPhilosophy[edit]\nIn Chinese philosophy, yin is the complementary feminine part of the taijitu and is represented by a dark lobe.\nPoetry[edit]\nThe use of darkness as a rhetorical device has a long-standing tradition. William Shakespeare, working in the 16th and 17th centuries, made a character called the \"prince of darkness\" (King Lear: III, iv) and gave darkness jaws with which to devour love. (A Midsummer Night's Dream: I, i) Geoffrey Chaucer, a 14th-century Middle English writer of The Canterbury Tales, wrote that knights must cast away the \"workes of darkness\". In Divine Comedy, Dante described hell as \"solid darkness stain'd\".\nLanguage[edit]\nIn Old English there were three words that could mean darkness: heolstor, genip, and sceadu. Heolstor also meant \"hiding-place\" and became holster. Genip meant \"mist\" and fell out of use like many strong verbs. It is however still used in the Dutch saying \"in het geniep\" which means secretly. Sceadu meant \"shadow\" and remained in use. The word dark eventually evolved from the word deorc.\n\nSee also[edit]\nLightness\nShadow\nTheory of colours\nNyctophobia"

    "content": "\nBreathing (spiration or ventilation) is the process of moving air into and from the lungs to facilitate gas exchange with the internal environment, mostly to flush out carbon dioxide and bring in oxygen.\nAll aerobic creatures need oxygen for cellular respiration, which extracts energy from the reaction of oxygen with molecules derived from food and produces carbon dioxide as a waste product. Breathing, or external respiration, brings air into the lungs where gas exchange takes place in the alveoli through diffusion. The body's circulatory system transports these gases to and from the cells, where cellular respiration takes place.\nThe breathing of all vertebrates with lungs consists of repetitive cycles of inhalation and exhalation through a highly branched system of tubes or airways which lead from the nose to the alveoli. The number of respiratory cycles per minute is the breathing or respiratory rate, and is one of the four primary vital signs of life. Under normal conditions the breathing depth and rate is automatically, and unconsciously, controlled by several homeostatic mechanisms which keep the partial pressures of carbon dioxide and oxygen in the arterial blood constant. Keeping the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the arterial blood unchanged under a wide variety of physiological circumstances, contributes significantly to tight control of the pH of the extracellular fluids (ECF). Over-breathing (hyperventilation) and under-breathing (hypoventilation), which decrease and increase the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide respectively, cause a rise in the pH of ECF in the first case, and a lowering of the pH in the second. Both cause distressing symptoms.\nBreathing has other important functions. It provides a mechanism for speech, laughter and similar expressions of the emotions. It is also used for reflexes such as yawning, coughing and sneezing. Animals that cannot thermoregulate by perspiration, because they lack sufficient sweat glands, may lose heat by evaporation through panting.\n\nMechanics[edit]\n\nFurther information: Muscles of respiration\nThe \"pump handle\" and \"bucket handle movements\" of the ribsThe effect of the muscles of inhalation in expanding the rib cage. The particular action illustrated here is called the pump handle movement of the rib cage.In this view of the rib cage the downward slope of the lower ribs from the midline outwards can be clearly seen. This allows a movement similar to the \"pump handle effect\", but in this case, it is called the bucket handle movement.\n\nBreathingThe muscles of breathing at rest: inhalation on the left, exhalation on the right. Contracting muscles are shown in red; relaxed muscles in blue. Contraction of the diaphragm generally contributes the most to the expansion of the chest cavity (light blue). However, at the same time, the intercostal muscles pull the ribs upwards (their effect is indicated by arrows) also causing the rib cage to expand during inhalation (see diagram on another side of the page). The relaxation of all these muscles during exhalation causes the rib cage and abdomen (light green) to elastically return to their resting positions. Compare these diagrams with the MRI video at the top of the page.The muscles of forceful breathing (inhalation and exhalation). The color code is the same as on the left. In addition to a more forceful and extensive contraction of the diaphragm, the intercostal muscles are aided by the accessory muscles of inhalation to exaggerate the movement of the ribs upwards, causing a greater expansion of the rib cage. During exhalation, apart from the relaxation of the muscles of inhalation, the abdominal muscles actively contract to pull the lower edges of the rib cage downwards decreasing the volume of the rib cage, while at the same time pushing the diaphragm upwards deep into the thorax.\nThe lungs are not capable of inflating themselves, and will expand only when there is an increase in the volume of the thoracic cavity. In humans, as in the other mammals, this is achieved primarily through the contraction of the diaphragm, but also by the contraction of the intercostal muscles which pull the rib cage upwards and outwards as shown in the diagrams on the right. During forceful inhalation (Figure on the right) the accessory muscles of inhalation, which connect the ribs and sternum to the cervical vertebrae and base of the skull, in many cases through an intermediary attachment to the clavicles, exaggerate the pump handle and bucket handle movements (see illustrations on the left), bringing about a greater change in the volume of the chest cavity. During exhalation (breathing out), at rest, all the muscles of inhalation relax, returning the chest and abdomen to a position called the \"resting position\", which is determined by their anatomical elasticity. At this point the lungs contain the functional residual capacity of air, which, in the adult human, has a volume of about 2.5\u20133.0 liters.\nDuring heavy breathing (hyperpnea) as, for instance, during exercise, exhalation is brought about by relaxation of all the muscles of inhalation, (in the same way as at rest), but, in addition, the abdominal muscles, instead of being passive, now contract strongly causing the rib cage to be pulled downwards (front and sides). This not only decreases the size of the rib cage but also pushes the abdominal organs upwards against the diaphragm which consequently bulges deeply into the thorax. The end-exhalatory lung volume is now less air than the resting \"functional residual capacity\". However, in a normal mammal, the lungs cannot be emptied completely. In an adult human, there is always still at least one liter of residual air left in the lungs after maximum exhalation.\nDiaphragmatic breathing causes the abdomen to rhythmically bulge out and fall back. It is, therefore, often referred to as \"abdominal breathing\". These terms are often used interchangeably because they describe the same action.\nWhen the accessory muscles of inhalation are activated, especially during labored breathing, the clavicles are pulled upwards, as explained above. This external manifestation of the use of the accessory muscles of inhalation is sometimes referred to as clavicular breathing, seen especially during asthma attacks and in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.\n\nPassage of air[edit]\n\nMain article: Respiratory tract\nThis is a diagram showing how inhalation and exhalation is controlled by a variety of muscles, and what that looks like from a general overall view.\nUpper airways[edit]\nThe lower airways.TracheaMainstem bronchusLobar bronchusSegmental bronchusBronchioleAlveolar ductAlveolus\nInhaled air is warmed and moistened by the wet, warm nasal mucosa, which consequently cools and dries. When warm, wet air from the lungs is breathed out through the nose, the cold hygroscopic mucus in the cool and dry nose re-captures some of the warmth and moisture from that exhaled air. In very cold weather the re-captured water may cause a \"dripping nose\".\nIdeally, air is breathed first out and secondly in through the nose. The nasal cavities (between the nostrils and the pharynx) are quite narrow, firstly by being divided in two by the nasal septum, and secondly by lateral walls that have several longitudinal folds, or shelves, called\nnasal conchae, thus exposing a large area of nasal mucous membrane to the air as it is inhaled (and exhaled). This causes the inhaled air to take up moisture from the wet mucus, and warmth from the underlying blood vessels, so that the air is very nearly saturated with water vapor and is at almost body temperature by the time it reaches the larynx. Part of this moisture and heat is recaptured as the exhaled air moves out over the partially dried-out, cooled mucus in the nasal passages, during exhalation. The sticky mucus also traps much of the particulate matter that is breathed in, preventing it from reaching the lungs.\nLower airways[edit]\nThe anatomy of a typical mammalian respiratory system, below the structures normally listed among the \"upper airways\" (the nasal cavities, the pharynx, and larynx), is often described as a respiratory tree or tracheobronchial tree (figure on the left). Larger airways give rise to branches that are slightly narrower, but more numerous than the \"trunk\" airway that gives rise to the branches. The human respiratory tree may consist of, on average, 23 such branchings into progressively smaller airways, while the respiratory tree of the mouse has up to 13 such branchings. Proximal divisions (those closest to the top of the tree, such as the trachea and bronchi) function mainly to transmit air to the lower airways. Later divisions such as the respiratory bronchioles, alveolar ducts and alveoli are specialized for gas exchange.\nThe trachea and the first portions of the main bronchi are outside the lungs. The rest of the \"tree\" branches within the lungs, and ultimately extends to every part of the lungs.\nThe alveoli are the blind-ended terminals of the \"tree\", meaning that any air that enters them has to exit the same way it came. A system such as this creates dead space, a term for the volume of air that fills the airways at the end of inhalation, and is breathed out, unchanged, during the next exhalation, never having reached the alveoli. Similarly, the dead space is filled with alveolar air at the end of exhalation, which is the first air to breathed back into the alveoli during inhalation, before any fresh air which follows after it. The dead space volume of a typical adult human is about 150\u00a0ml.\n\nGas exchange[edit]\n\nMain article: Gas exchange\nThe primary purpose of breathing is to refresh air in the alveoli so that gas exchange can take place in the blood. The equilibration of the partial pressures of the gases in the alveolar blood and the alveolar air occurs by diffusion. After exhaling, adult human lungs still contain 2.5\u20133 L of air, their functional residual capacity or FRC. On inhalation, only about 350 mL of new, warm, moistened atmospheric air is brought in and is well mixed with the FRC. Consequently, the gas composition of the FRC changes very little during the breathing cycle. This means that the pulmonary, capillary blood always equilibrates with a relatively constant air composition in the lungs and the diffusion rate with arterial blood gases remains equally constant with each breath. Body tissues are therefore not exposed to large swings in oxygen and carbon dioxide tensions in the blood caused by the breathing cycle, and the peripheral and central chemoreceptors measure only gradual changes in dissolved gases. Thus the homeostatic control of the breathing rate depends only on the partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the arterial blood, which then also maintains a constant pH of the blood.\n\nControl[edit]\n\nMain article: Control of ventilation\nThe rate and depth of breathing is automatically controlled by the respiratory centers that receive information from the peripheral and central chemoreceptors. These chemoreceptors continuously monitor the partial pressures of carbon dioxide and oxygen in the arterial blood. The first of these sensors are the central chemoreceptors on the surface of the medulla oblongata of the brain stem which are particularly sensitive to pH as well as the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid. The second group of sensors measure the partial pressure of oxygen in the arterial blood. Together the latter are known as the peripheral chemoreceptors, and are situated in the aortic and carotid bodies. Information from all of these chemoreceptors is conveyed to the respiratory centers in the pons and medulla oblongata, which responds to fluctuations in the partial pressures of carbon dioxide and oxygen in the arterial blood by adjusting the rate and depth of breathing, in such a way as to restore the partial pressure of carbon dioxide to 5.3\u00a0kPa (40\u00a0mm\u00a0Hg), the pH to 7.4 and, to a lesser extent, the partial pressure of oxygen to 13\u00a0kPa (100\u00a0mm\u00a0Hg). For example, exercise increases the production of carbon dioxide by the active muscles. This carbon dioxide diffuses into the venous blood and ultimately raises the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the arterial blood. This is immediately sensed by the carbon dioxide chemoreceptors on the brain stem. The respiratory centers respond to this information by causing the rate and depth of breathing to increase to such an extent that the partial pressures of carbon dioxide and oxygen in the arterial blood return almost immediately to the same levels as at rest. The respiratory centers communicate with the muscles of breathing via motor nerves, of which the phrenic nerves, which innervate the diaphragm, are probably the most important.\nAutomatic breathing can be overridden to a limited extent by simple choice, or to facilitate swimming, speech, singing or other vocal training. It is impossible to suppress the urge to breathe to the point of hypoxia but training can increase the ability to hold one's breath. Conscious breathing practices have been shown to promote relaxation and stress relief but have not been proven to have any other health benefits.\nOther automatic breathing control reflexes also exist. Submersion, particularly of the face, in cold water, triggers a response called the diving reflex. This has the initial result of shutting down the airways against the influx of water. The metabolic rate slows down. This is coupled with intense vasoconstriction of the arteries to the limbs and abdominal viscera, reserving the oxygen that is in blood and lungs at the beginning of the dive almost exclusively for the heart and the brain. The diving reflex is an often-used response in animals that routinely need to dive, such as penguins, seals and whales. It is also more effective in very young infants and children than in adults.\n\n\nComposition[edit]\n\nFurther information: Atmospheric chemistry\nFollowing on from the above diagram, if the exhaled air is breathed out through the mouth on a cold and humid conditions, the water vapor will condense into a visible cloud or mist.\nInhaled air is by volume 78% nitrogen, 20.95% oxygen and small amounts of other gases including argon, carbon dioxide, neon, helium, and hydrogen.\nThe gas exhaled is 4% to 5% by volume of carbon dioxide, about a 100 fold increase over the inhaled amount. The volume of oxygen is reduced by about a quarter, 4% to 5%, of total air volume. The typical composition is:\n5.0\u20136.3% water vapor\n79% nitrogen \n13.6\u201316.0% oxygen\n4.0\u20135.3% carbon dioxide\n1% argon\nparts per million (ppm) of hydrogen, from the metabolic activity of microorganisms in the large intestine.\nppm of carbon monoxide from degradation of heme proteins.\n1 ppm of ammonia.\nTrace many hundreds of volatile organic compounds, especially isoprene and acetone. The presence of certain organic compounds indicates disease.\nIn addition to air, underwater divers practicing technical diving may breathe oxygen-rich, oxygen-depleted or helium-rich breathing gas mixtures. Oxygen and analgesic gases are sometimes given to patients under medical care. The atmosphere in space suits is pure oxygen. However, this is kept at around 20% of Earthbound atmospheric pressure to regulate the rate of inspiration.\n\nEffects of ambient air pressure[edit]\nBreathing at altitude[edit]\n\nSee also: Effects of high altitude on humans\nFig. 4 Atmospheric pressure\nAtmospheric pressure decreases with the height above sea level (altitude) and since the alveoli are open to the outside air through the open airways, the pressure in the lungs also decreases at the same rate with altitude. At altitude, a pressure differential is still required to drive air into and out of the lungs as it is at sea level. The mechanism for breathing at altitude is essentially identical to breathing at sea level but with the following differences:\nThe atmospheric pressure decreases exponentially with altitude, roughly halving with every 5,500 metres (18,000\u00a0ft) rise in altitude. The composition of atmospheric air is, however, almost constant below 80\u00a0km, as a result of the continuous mixing effect of the weather. The concentration of oxygen in the air (mmols O2 per liter of air) therefore decreases at the same rate as the atmospheric pressure. At sea level, where the ambient pressure is about 100\u00a0kPa, oxygen constitutes 21% of the atmosphere and the partial pressure of oxygen (PO2) is 21\u00a0kPa (i.e. 21% of 100\u00a0kPa). At the summit of Mount Everest, 8,848 metres (29,029\u00a0ft), where the total atmospheric pressure is 33.7\u00a0kPa, oxygen still constitutes 21% of the atmosphere but its partial pressure is only 7.1\u00a0kPa (i.e. 21% of 33.7\u00a0kPa = 7.1\u00a0kPa). Therefore, a greater volume of air must be inhaled at altitude than at sea level in order to breathe in the same amount of oxygen in a given period.\nDuring inhalation, air is warmed and saturated with water vapor as it passes through the nose and pharynx before it enters the alveoli. The saturated vapor pressure of water is dependent only on temperature; at a body core temperature of 37\u00a0\u00b0C it is 6.3\u00a0kPa (47.0\u00a0mmHg), regardless of any other influences, including altitude. Consequently, at sea level, the tracheal air (immediately before the inhaled air enters the alveoli) consists of: water vapor (PH2O = 6.3\u00a0kPa), nitrogen (PN2 = 74.0\u00a0kPa), oxygen (PO2 = 19.7\u00a0kPa) and trace amounts of carbon dioxide and other gases, a total of 100\u00a0kPa. In dry air, the PO2 at sea level is 21.0\u00a0kPa, compared to a PO2 of 19.7\u00a0kPa in the tracheal air (21% of [100 \u2013 6.3] = 19.7\u00a0kPa). At the summit of Mount Everest tracheal air has a total pressure of 33.7\u00a0kPa, of which 6.3\u00a0kPa is water vapor, reducing the PO2 in the tracheal air to 5.8\u00a0kPa (21% of [33.7 \u2013 6.3] = 5.8\u00a0kPa), beyond what is accounted for by a reduction of atmospheric pressure alone (7.1\u00a0kPa).\nThe pressure gradient forcing air into the lungs during inhalation is also reduced by altitude. Doubling the volume of the lungs halves the pressure in the lungs at any altitude. Having the sea level air pressure (100\u00a0kPa) results in a pressure gradient of 50\u00a0kPa but doing the same at 5500\u00a0m, where the atmospheric pressure is 50\u00a0kPa, a doubling of the volume of the lungs results in a pressure gradient of the only 25\u00a0kPa. In practice, because we breathe in a gentle, cyclical manner that generates pressure gradients of only 2\u20133\u00a0kPa, this has little effect on the actual rate of inflow into the lungs and is easily compensated for by breathing slightly deeper. The lower viscosity of air at altitude allows air to flow more easily and this also helps compensate for any loss of pressure gradient.\nAll of the above effects of low atmospheric pressure on breathing are normally accommodated by increasing the respiratory minute volume (the volume of air breathed in \u2014 or out \u2014 per minute), and the mechanism for doing this is automatic. The exact increase required is determined by the respiratory gases homeostatic mechanism, which regulates the arterial PO2 and PCO2. This homeostatic mechanism prioritizes the regulation of the arterial PCO2 over that of oxygen at sea level. That is to say, at sea level the arterial PCO2 is maintained at very close to 5.3\u00a0kPa (or 40\u00a0mmHg) under a wide range of circumstances, at the expense of the arterial PO2, which is allowed to vary within a very wide range of values, before eliciting a corrective ventilatory response. However, when the atmospheric pressure (and therefore the atmospheric PO2) falls to below 75% of its value at sea level, oxygen homeostasis is given priority over carbon dioxide homeostasis. This switch-over occurs at an elevation of about 2,500 metres (8,200\u00a0ft). If this switch occurs relatively abruptly, the hyperventilation at high altitude will cause a severe fall in the arterial PCO2 with a consequent rise in the pH of the arterial plasma leading to respiratory alkalosis. This is one contributor to high altitude sickness. On the other hand, if the switch to oxygen homeostasis is incomplete, then hypoxia may complicate the clinical picture with potentially fatal results.\nBreathing at depth[edit]\nTypical breathing effort when breathing through a diving regulator\nPressure increases with the depth of water at the rate of about one atmosphere \u2013 slightly more than 100 kPa, or one bar, for every 10 meters. Air breathed underwater by divers is at the ambient pressure of the surrounding water and this has a complex range of physiological and biochemical implications. If not properly managed, breathing compressed gasses underwater may lead to several diving disorders which include pulmonary barotrauma, decompression sickness, nitrogen narcosis, and oxygen toxicity. The effects of breathing gasses under pressure are further complicated by the use of one or more special gas mixtures.\nAir is provided by a diving regulator, which reduces the high pressure in a diving cylinder to the ambient pressure. The breathing performance of regulators is a factor when choosing a suitable regulator for the type of diving to be undertaken. It is desirable that breathing from a regulator requires low effort even when supplying large amounts of air. It is also recommended that it supplies air smoothly without any sudden changes in resistance while inhaling or exhaling. In the graph, right, note the initial spike in pressure on exhaling to open the exhaust valve and that the initial drop in pressure on inhaling is soon overcome as the Venturi effect designed into the regulator to allow an easy draw of air. Many regulators have an adjustment to change the ease of inhaling so that breathing is effortless.\n\nRespiratory disorders[edit]\nMedical condition\nBreathing patternsGraph showing normal as well as different kinds of pathological breathing patterns.\nAbnormal breathing patterns include Kussmaul breathing, Biot's respiration and Cheyne\u2013Stokes respiration.\nOther breathing disorders include shortness of breath (dyspnea), stridor, apnea, sleep apnea (most commonly obstructive sleep apnea), mouth breathing, and snoring. Many conditions are associated with obstructed airways. Chronic mouth breathing may be associated with illness. Hypopnea refers to overly shallow breathing; hyperpnea refers to fast and deep breathing brought on by a demand for more oxygen, as for example by exercise. The terms hypoventilation and hyperventilation also refer to shallow breathing and fast and deep breathing respectively, but under inappropriate circumstances or disease. However, this distinction (between, for instance, hyperpnea and hyperventilation) is not always adhered to, so that these terms are frequently used interchangeably.\nA range of breath tests can be used to diagnose diseases such as dietary intolerances.\nA rhinomanometer uses acoustic technology to examine the air flow through the nasal passages.\n\nSociety and culture[edit]\nThe word \"spirit\" comes from the Latin spiritus, meaning breath. Historically, breath has often been considered in terms of the concept of life force. The Hebrew Bible refers to God breathing the breath of life into clay to make Adam a living soul (nephesh). It also refers to the breath as returning to God when a mortal dies. The terms spirit, prana, the Polynesian mana, the Hebrew ruach and the psyche in psychology are related to the concept of breath.\nIn tai chi, aerobic exercise is combined with breathing exercises to strengthen the diaphragm muscles, improve posture and make better use of the body's qi. Different forms of meditation, and yoga advocate various breathing methods. A form of Buddhist meditation called anapanasati meaning mindfulness of breath was first introduced by Buddha. Breathing disciplines are incorporated into meditation, certain forms of yoga such as pranayama, and the Buteyko method as a treatment for asthma and other conditions.\nIn music, some wind instrument players use a technique called circular breathing. Singers also rely on breath control.\nCommon cultural expressions related to breathing include: \"to catch my breath\", \"took my breath away\", \"inspiration\", \"to expire\", \"get my breath back\".\nBreathing and mood[edit]\nA young gymnast breathes deeply before performing his exercise.\nCertain breathing patterns have a tendency to occur with certain moods. Due to this relationship, practitioners of various disciplines consider that they can encourage the occurrence of a particular mood by adopting the breathing pattern that it most commonly occurs in conjunction with. For instance, and perhaps the most common recommendation is that deeper breathing which utilizes the diaphragm and abdomen more can encourage relaxation. Practitioners of different disciplines often interpret the importance of breathing regulation and its perceived influence on mood in different ways. Buddhists may consider that it helps precipitate a sense of inner-peace, holistic healers that it encourages an overall state of health and business advisers that it provides relief from work-based stress.\nBreathing and physical exercise[edit]\nDuring physical exercise, a deeper breathing pattern is adapted to facilitate greater oxygen absorption. An additional reason for the adoption of a deeper breathing pattern is to strengthen the body's core. During the process of deep breathing, the thoracic diaphragm adopts a lower position in the core and this helps to generate intra-abdominal pressure which strengthens the lumbar spine. Typically, this allows for more powerful physical movements to be performed. As such, it is frequently recommended when lifting heavy weights to take a deep breath or adopt a deeper breathing pattern.\n\nSee also[edit]\nAgonal respiration\u00a0\u2013 Abnormal pattern of breathing (not related to death rattle)\nAtaxic respiration\u00a0\u2013 Abnormal pattern of breathing\nBad breath\u00a0\u2013 Presence of unpleasant odors in exhaled breath\nBreath gas analysis\u00a0\u2013 monitoring volatile organic compounds present in the exhaled breathPages displaying wikidata descriptions as a fallback\nBreathing gas\u00a0\u2013 Gas used for human respiration\nCarbon cycle\u00a0\u2013 Natural processes of carbon exchange\nCentral sleep apnea\u00a0\u2013 Sleep-related disorder in which the effort to breathe is diminished\nEupnea\u00a0\u2013 Natural, comfortable form of breathing in mammals\nLiquid breathing\u00a0\u2013 Respiration of oxygen-rich liquid by a normally air-breathing organism\nMouth breathing\u00a0\u2013 Breathing method in humans\nNasal cycle\u00a0\u2013 Unconscious alternation of the nasal cavities\nNitrogen washout\u00a0\u2013 Test for measuring anatomic dead space in the lung during a respiratory cycle\nObligate nasal breathing\u00a0\u2013 physiological necessity to breathe through the nose rather than the mouthPages displaying wikidata descriptions as a fallback\nRespiratory adaptation\u00a0\u2013 Breathing chages caused by exertion"

Submit Listen Key facts Bacteria are single cells that can survive on their own, inside or outside the body. Viruses cause infections by entering and multiplying inside the host's healthy cells. It can be difficult to know what causes an infection, because viral and bacterial infections can cause similar symptoms. Antibiotics won't work for viral infections. Misusing antibiotics to treat viral infections contributes to the problem of antibiotic resistance. Antibiotics won't cure viral infections. How are bacteria different from viruses? Bacteria and viruses are too tiny to see with the naked eye. They can cause similar symptoms and are often spread in the same way, but are different in most other ways. Bacteria are single cells that can survive on their own, inside or outside the body. Most bacteria aren't harmful. In fact, you have many harmless and helpful bacteria on your skin and inside your body, especially in the gut to help digest food. Viruses are smaller and are not cells. Unlike bacteria, they need a host such as a human or animal to multiply. Viruses cause infections by entering and multiplying inside the body's healthy cells. How are bacterial infections different from viral infections? It can be difficult to know what causes an infection, because viral and bacterial infections can cause similar symptoms. Your doctor may need a sample of your urine, stool or blood, or a swab from your nose or throat to see what sort of infection you have. If you have symptoms on an infection, it is important to know if it is caused by bacteria or viruses, because the treatments differ. Examples of bacterial infections include whooping cough , strep throat , ear infection and urinary tract infection (UTI) . Examples of viral infections include the common cold and flu , most coughs and bronchitis , chickenpox , monkeypox , COVID-19 and HIV/AIDS . What treatment will I receive for bacterial and viral infections? Treating a bacterial infection Doctors usually treat bacterial infections with antibiotics. It's important to match the antibiotic with the specific type of bacterial infection you have. The right antibiotic will kill bacteria or stop them multiplying. Antibiotic resistance is a growing problem in Australia and the world. It is caused, in part, by overuse of antibiotics in humans, animals and the environment. This is one of the reasons why your doctor will only prescribe antibiotics when they are confident that the benefits of treatment are greater than the risks. Treating a viral infection Antibiotics aren't effective against viral infections. If you have a viral infection, your doctor may recommend one or more of the following treatments: rest at home to allow your immune system to fight the virus managing symptoms, such as warm drinks or chicken soup to soothe your throat and stay hydrated paracetamol to relieve fever stopping viral reproduction using antiviral medicines, such as medicines for HIV/AIDS and cold sores preventing infection in the first place, such as vaccines for flu and hepatitis Source s : University of Queensland Institute for molecular Bioscience (What\u2019s the difference between bacteria and viruses?) , Department of Health and Aged care (Antimicrobial resistance) , Royal Children's Hospital (Viral illnesses) Learn more here about the development and quality assurance of healthdirect content .

BENNETT\nSchool of Biological Sciences, University of California, Irvine, California 9271 7,\nUSA.\nSUMMARY\nRates of force development, contraction and relaxation of vertebrate\nskeletal muscle are temperature dependent with Qlo values of approximately 2. Maximal forces developed have a low or negative thermal dependence. The functional basis of these patterns is poorly understood. Muscle\nperformance generally does not acclimate. There appears to have been\nsome evolutionary adaptation among species and classes to different\nthermal regimes, such that muscles from cold-adapted species maintain\nbetter mechanical performance at low temperatures than do those from\nwarm-adapted animals. However, rate processes remain strongly thermally dependent even in animals with low or variable body temperatures.\nThis thermal dependence of muscle in vitro is reflected in behavioural\nperformance: maximal force generation in vivo is temperature independent and time-dependent activities are more rapid at higher muscle temperatures.\nINTRODUCTION\nMechanical performance of muscle is greatly influenced by temperature, as are\nmost biological processes. Maximal forces developed by muscles and their rates\nof force generation, contraction, relaxation and power output are all altered when\nbody temperature varies. As these muscular forces and rate processes underlie\nbehavioural capacities, these may also be thermally dependent. Such factors as\nmaximal locomotor speed and reaction rates may change with temperature and\nbe so slow in the cold that effective escape or pursuit by an animal is curtailed.\nIn animals that are subjected to varying or low body temperatures, we might expect\nto find adaptations which minimize the thermal dependence of muscle performance.\nThe influence of temperature on the mechanical performance of vertebrate skeletal\nmuscle is reviewed in this paper, first for one species of lizard and then for vertebrates\nmore generally. Adaptations of muscle performance to temperature are examined,\nunderlying mechanisms of thermal dependence are reviewed and implications for\nbehaviour are discussed.\nKey words: Acclimation, adaptation, mechanical properties.\nTEMPERATURE AND MECHANICAL PERFORMANCE\nFirst, we will examine the influence of temperature on the contractile performance\nof muscle from a lizard. Lizards are a particularly useful group of animals for such\nstudies as they may naturally experience a wide range of body temperatures daily.\nMany species also have very high thermal tolerance. Data are presented here (Fig. 1)\non the influence of temperature on several aspects of force generation and contraction\nof skeletal muscle of the lizard Dipsosaums dorsalis (Marsh & Bennett, 1985).\nDipsosaums inhabits the hot desert regions of California and regulates field body\ntemperatures at approximately 40\u00b0C. However, it must maintain the capacity to\nreact and move even when its body temperature is far below these diurnal levels.\nThe reported data were measured on the white portion of the iliofibularis muscle of\nthe hind limb. This preparation is composed almost exclusively of fast glycolytic\nfibres (Gleeson, Putnam & Bennett, 1980), which constitute the large majority of\nfibres in all the locomotory muscles of this species (Putnam, Gleeson & Bennett,\n1980).\nAll contractile rate processes in this muscle, both isometric and isotonic, are greatly\naccelerated by increasing temperature, even up to 44\u00b0C. In isometric twitch, the rates\nof both tension development (measured as the inverse of time-to-peak tension, TPT)\nand relaxation (measured as the inverse of time to return to 50 % of maximal twitch\ntension, I/~RT) have Qlo values of 2.36 and 2.82, respectively, between 20 and\n30\u00b0C. Maximal rate of isometric tetanic tension development (dpo/dt) has a Qlo of\n2-22 over this range. The maximal velocity of shortening (V,,) and maximal power\noutput (w,,) during isotonic contractions are similarly thermally dependent with\nQlo values of 1.95 and 2-42, respectively. All these rates have a thermal dependence\nsimilar to those of most other biological processes (i.e. Qlo=2-3, Precht,\nChristophersen, Hensel & Larcher, 1973; Prosser, 1973).\nIn contrast, the temperature dependence of force exerted during isometric\ncontraction is substantially different from that of contractile rate processes. Tetanic\ntension (Po) has a significant but very low thermal dependence: its thermal ratio\n(Rlo, the ratio of two quantities measured over a 10\u00b0C interval, Bennett, 1984) is\n1.2 between 20 and 30\u00b0C. Maximal Po is attained at 40\u00b0C. Twitch tension (P,) is\nmaximal at 15\"C, declining at higher temperatures (Rlo = 0.62 between 20 and\n30\u00b0C).\nForce and its rate of development thus have very different thermal sensitivities in this\nlizard. Nearly maximal muscular performance is obtained at normal field activity\ntemperature (40\u00b0C): contraction and relaxation rates are rapid and tetanic force is\nmaximal. Twitch tension is the only factor that is not near its maximal value at this\ntemperature. Exposure to low temperatures greatly retards the speed of muscle\ncontraction in Dipsosaums. This dependence may restrict locomotory responses at low\nbody temperature: the speed of limb movement during burst escape speed in this lizard is\nlimited by the time course of the muscle twitch at 25\u00b0C and below (Marsh & Bennett,\n1985). Low temperature does not similarly affect force output. Nearly the same tetanic\ntension can be produced and twitch tension is even increased.\nTemperature and muscle 335\nHow representative is the thermal dependence of muscle function in Dipsosaums?\nQlo and Rlo values measured approximately between 20 and 30\u00b0C from all other\nstudies available on vertebrate skeletal muscle are given in Fig. 2.

Data\nfrom Marsh & Bennett (1985).\nobservations were made on amphibian and mammalian muscle. Although the variance\nin the data is high, due to such factors as the diversity of animals examined, differing\nfibre type composition of the muscles and different measurement techniques, the\npattern is clear. As in the lizard muscle, rate processes in general are thermally\ndependent with Qlo values of approximately 2, tetanic tension has a very low thermal\ndependence and twitch tension often decreases over this temperature range.\nADAPTATIONS TO TEMPERATURE\nThis general pattern of high thermal dependence of rate processes might be\nexpected to pose problems for poikilothermic organisms. As muscle temperature\nchanges, so do contractile speeds and possibly reaction rates or locomotor ability.\nPoikilotherms with low body temperatures might not attain maximal performance of\nwhich their muscles are capable due to an extrinsic factor, temperature, rather than an\nintrinsic structural or biochemical limitation. For example, the lizard Gerrhonotus\nmulticarinatus has field active body temperatures of about 25 \"C, but maximal rates of\nmuscle contraction and burst escape speed at 35-40\u00b0C (Bennett, 1980; Putnam &\nBennett, 1982), body temperatures far in excess of those encountered under any\nForce Rate\nTPT 112 RT\nFig. 2.

Such a pattern of thermal dependence does not appear particularly\nadaptive. To what extent has there been adjustment to minimize the thermal\nperturbation of contractile rate processes in animals with low and/or variable body\ntemperatures? Few data on this topic exist, so no confident generalizations are\npossible, but the studies available suggest some interesting adaptive patterns.\nAcclimation\nWhen an individual animal is exposed to a new thermal regime, it often shows\ncompensatory changes in its physiological reactions (acclimation). Biological rate\nprocesses are initially altered in accordance with their Qlo upon acute temperature\nexposure. Over several days or weeks, these rates often return partially or completely\nto their original levels, even while the new thermal regime is maintained (Precht et al.\n1973; Prosser, 1973). Several comprehensive studies on the effect of long-term\ntemperature exposure have been done on the mechanical performance of skeletal\nmuscles of anuran amphibians. As illustrated for twitch kinetics (Fig. 3), no\nacclimation of either force generation (P,, Po) or contractile rate (TPT, ~/ZRT,\ndpo/dt, V,,,, w,,,) has been demonstrated (Renaud & Stevens, 1981a,b; Rome,\n1983). The initial depression of contraction rates by cold exposure is maintained\nindefinitely. A similar lack of acclimation occurs in locomotor capacity of these\nanimals (Putnam & Bennett, 1981). In fish, myofibrillar ATPase activity, which\nshould be reflected in V, (BBrBny, 1967), has been shown to acclimate in goldfish\n(Johnston, 1979) but not in killifish (Sidell, Johnston, Moerland & Goldspink, 1983).\nTPT 112 RT\n0J , I 1 I I 1\n5 15 25 5 15 25\nExperimental temperature (\"C)\nFig. 3.

The only significant difference among acclimation groups is a longer\n112 RT for 25\u00b0C-acclimated frogs measured at 15T. Data from Renaud & Stevens (1981~).\nThe lack of acclimation of muscle function is a very puzzling result in view of its\nobvious importance to behavioural capacity and may reflect a constraint on\nadaptation.\nInterspecz$c compan'sons\nStudies comparing species naturally exposed to different thermal regimes show a\ndifferent pattern of adjustment of muscle function over evolutionary time. In lizards,\nspecies with lower activity temperatures have lower Qlo values for TPT, 112 RT and\ndpo/dt and faster twitch responses measured at any common temperature (Putnam &\nBennett, 1982). Maximization of P, at preferred thermal levels previously reported\n(Licht, 1964) has not been confirmed (Putnam & Bennett, 1982). The range of\ntemperatures over which lizard muscles can function is clearly affected by their\nthermal regimes (Ushakov, 1964; Licht, 1964; Putnam & Bennett, 1982): muscles\nfrom more thermophilic species lose contractile ability and undergo irreversible heat\ndamage at substantially higher temperatures than do those of more cryophilic animals.\nIn fish, actomyosin ATPases of species from cold environments have both lower Qlo\nvalues and greater activities at any common temperature than those from warmadapted fish (Fig. 4) (Johnston, Walesby, Davison & Goldspink, 1977; Johnston &\nWalesby, 1977, 1979). In both fish and lizards, evolutionary adaptation to temperature has evidently proceeded with both a shift (translation) and rotation of the\nrate-temperature curve.\nr I I I I I i\n0 10 20 30\nTemperature (\"C)\nFig. 4.

Data from Johnston & Walesby (1979).\nTemperature and muscle 339\nIt should be emphasized, however, that these interspecific differences are only\nrelative. In absolute terms, rate processes are still very thermally dependent even in\ncold-adapted species.\nComparison of muscle from homeothems and poikilothems\nAre there major differences in the thermal dependence of muscle function in\nhomeotherms and poikilotherms? One might anticipate that the latter would show\nadaptations to minimize thermal dependence and the former would optimize function\nover a narrow range of high temperatures. It should be noted, however, that even\nmuscles from homeotherms may undergo major temperature changes depending on\nambient conditions and work intensity (e.g. Saltin, Gagge & Stolwijk, 1968).\nSome functional differences are apparent between muscle from anuran amphibians\nand mammals (Bennett, 1984). Anuran muscle develops maximal P, at O\u00b0C;\nmammalian peak P, usually occurs at 20\u00b0C. Maximal Po is maintained at lower\ntemperatures in anurans: Po of anuran muscle declines below approximately lS\u00b0C,\nthat of mammalian muscle always decreases below 25 OC (Fig. 5). The time course of a\nmuscle twitch, both TPT and 112 RT, has a lower Qlo in anurans than in mammals.\nAnuran muscle is thus capable of producing maximal tension at lower temperatures\nthan is mammalian muscle and its rate processes are less temperature sensitive, at least\nin regard to twitch kinetics. However, the distinction between the thermal\ndependence of saurian and mammalian muscle function is much less clear (Bennett,\n1984). Although maximal P, is developed at lower temperatures in lizard than in\nmammalian muscle, the thermal dependencies of Po and contractile rate processes are\nalmost identical in these groups. The anuran-mammalian differences probably reflect\n100 -\nMammalian\n80 -\n-\nd\n// Amphibian\n10 20 30\nTemperature (\"C)\nFig. 5.

Data summarized from the literature by Bennett (1984).\nadaptation to very different thermal regimes rather than a dichotomy in the functional\ncapacity of muscle from poikilotherms and homeotherms.\nIt is apparent from the foregoing that some adjustments of vertebrate skeletal\nmuscle function have evolved with respect to temperature. These adaptations in rate\nprocesses, however, have not been substantial. Muscle from poikilotherms still has a\nmarked thermal dependence and rate processes are often faster at temperatures above\nthose normally encountered. Lack of acclimation of these properties in individual\nanimals further points to a lack of plasticity in these systems in regard to temperature\nadjustment. 1n view of the small number of studies, it should be evident that more\ncomparative work is required to substantiate or alter these conclusions.\nFUNCTIONAL BASIS OF THERMAL DEPENDENCE\nThe biochemical and functional properties that underlie these patterns of thermal\ndependence are not well understood. The pronounced thermal dependence of\ncontractile rate processes are expected, as several of the steps underlying contraction\nand relaxation are enzymatically catalysed and have rates with Qlo values of 2.0 or\nmore. For instance, strong thermal dependencies have been demonstrated for the rate\nof ca2+ release (Blinks, Riidel & Taylor, 1978; Rall, 1979), the activity of actomyosin\nATPase (Bendall, 1964; Hartshorne, Barns, Parker & Fuchs, 1972) and ca2+ uptake\nby sarcoplasmic reticulum (Yamamoto & Tonomura, 1967; Blinks et al. 1978).\nHowever, the correspondence between the thermal dependence of contractile events\nand isolated enzyme systems associated with them is often poor. For example,\nalthough actomyosin ATPase is thought to be an important determinant of V,,,, the\nthermal dependence of the former is much greater than that of the latter (Biriny,\n1967). An attempt to determine limiting factors of contractile events by comparisons\nof thermal dependencies would probably be no more successful than previous\nattempts to elucidate controlling reactions of biochemical pathways by measurement\nof Arrhenius activation energies.\nTwitch tension is generally maximal at 0-20\u00b0C, depending on species and muscle\ntype, and declines at higher temperatures. In some sense, the muscle is not as fully\nactivated by a single stimulus at temperatures above 20\u00b0C (Ranatunga, 1977). The\nratio of P,/P~ approaches 1.0 at low temperatures but is less than 0.5 at higher\ntemperatures (Putnam & Bennett, 1982). One possible explanation for this response is\ninsufficient ca2+ release into fibres at higher temperatures. This is evidently not the\ncase, however, as activation heat, which represents the energetic cost of ca2+ release\nand removal, is thermally independent, indicating no deficiency of release at higher\ntemperatures (Homsher, Mommaerts, Ricchiuti & Wallner, 1972; Rall, 1979).\nAdditionally, measurements with aequorin indicate high levels of ca2+ within the\nfibre at higher temperatures (Blinks et al. 1978). The latter measurements also\nindicate a much shorter time course for the presence of ca2+ within the fibre at higher\ntemperatures and a consequently shorter period of activation. At high temperatures,\ninsufficient time may be available to attain maximal force. Twitch contraction may be\nlooked upon as a competition between actomyosin ATPase activity and ca2+ removal\nTemperature and muscle 341\nby the sarcoplasmic reticulum (Josephson, 1981). These processes evidently have\ndifferent thermal dependencies, with the latter being more temperature sensitive; the\nQlo of 1/2RT is generally greater than that of TPT measured on the same muscle\n(Hill, 1951; Walker, 1960; Bennett, 1984). Thus at low temperatures, greater force\ncan be attained by the contractile proteins, even though their intrinsic contractile\nvelocity is also slowed, before deactivation processes become effective. This\nexplanation of the thermal dependence of P,, while attractive, has not been critically\ntested.\nTetanic tension generally has a low but significant thermal dependence below\n15-25\"C, depending on species (Fig. 5). As the muscle is supposedly completely\nactivated by repetitive stimuli, one might expect Po to be thermally independent over\nthe entire temperature range. One explanation for lower Po at low temperatures is a\nsmaller number of cross-bridge attachments at those temperatures. However,\nmeasurements of instantaneous stiffness, which is dependent upon the number of\ncross-bridges attached, do not support this hypothesis (Ford, Huxley & Simmons,\n1977; Kuhn et al. 1979; Bressler, 198 1). Instantaneous stiffness is either thermally\nindependent or has a different thermal dependence from that of Po. Consequently, the\nnumber of cross-bridges attached or a thermally-dependent bridge cycling does not\nappear to account for the observed pattern. Bressler (1981) suggests that increasing\ntemperature may increase the tension per cross-bridge during tetanus.\nIt should be clear that further work is required to explain the bases of the thermal\ndependence of muscle function. Investigations exploiting thermal dependence may\nwell lead to further hypotheses and insights into the nature of the contractile process\nitself (e.g. Mittenthal, 1975, on the distance of cross-bridge movement). Muscle from\nanimals and/or animal groups with very different thermal histories could be\nparticularly useful in these studies. For example, the different response of Po to\ntemperature in anuran and mammalian muscle (Fig. 5) may be helpful to\nunderstanding patterns of cross-bridge tension generation and cycling during tetany.\nOr, the differing thermal dependencies of myofibrillar ATPase from animals adapted\nto different temperatures (e.g. Fig. 4) may help elucidate their role in determining\nintrinsic shortening velocities.\nTHERMAL DEPENDENCE OF MUSCLE PERFORMANCE IN VIVO\nIs the thermal dependence of muscle function reflected in animal behavioural\ncapacities? On the basis of experiments on isolated muscle, one would expect\nperformance capacity for behaviour involving rates of contraction (e.g. running speed)\nto improve with increasing temperature. One would also expect performance involving\nmaximal force generation by an animal to be relatively temperature independent.\nPhysical performance involving rate-dependent factors, such as maximal power\noutput, does improve significantly with increasing muscle temperature (e.g.\nAsmussen & Bgje, 1945; Binkhorst, Hoofd & Vissers, 1977; Bergh & Ekblom, 1979).\nConsequently, 'warming up', in the literal sense, does have a positive effect on\nperformance speed, and animals with higher body temperatures do in fact have\ngreater maximal speeds (Webb, 1978; Bennett, 1980; Putnam & Bennett, 1981).\nHowever, the thermal dependence of this performance is distinctly lower than that of\nrate processes in isolated muscle. For example, in the lizard Dipsosaums, maximal\nrunning velocity and limb cycling frequency have Qlo values of 1.3-1.4 from 25 to\n40\u00b0C, while Vma, and Wm, have Qlo values of 1.7 and 2.0, respectively (Fig. 6)\n(Marsh & Bennett, 1985). Similarly low Qlo values of 1.0-1.6 have been reported in\nother studies on rate-dependent performance cited above. This lower thermal\ndependence of behavioural performance compared to that of isolated muscle function\ncould be attributable to several factors, including storage of energy in elastic\nstructures of low thermal sensitivity (Marsh & Bennett, 1985). However, its basis is\nunknown at present.\nMaximal force generation by muscles in vivo is almost independent of muscle\ntemperature from 25 to 40\u00b0C (Binkhorst et al. 1977; Bergh & Ekblom, 1979;\nPetrofsky, Burse & Lind, 1981). This pattern accords very well with the observed\nthermal independence of Po over this temperature range. Endurance, measured as the\ntime of maintenance of constant force, is maximal at approximately 30\u00b0C in both in\n0 J, I I I I I I\n15 25 35 45\nTemperature (\"C)\nFig. 6.

Higher muscle temperatures may be expected to result in improved rate\nperformance in vivo, although maximal force application may be little affected and\nendurance may decline.\nFinancial support for this work was provided by NSF Grant PCM 81-02331.

    "content": "\nVasodilation, also known as vasorelaxation, is the widening of blood vessels.  It results from relaxation of smooth muscle cells within the vessel walls, in particular in the large veins, large arteries, and smaller arterioles. Blood vessel walls are composed of endothelial tissue and a basal membrane lining the lumen of the vessel, concentric smooth muscle layers on top of endothelial tissue, and an adventitia over the smooth muscle layers. Relaxation of the smooth muscle layer allows the blood vessel to dilate, as it is held in a semi-constricted state by sympathetic nervous system activity. Vasodilation is the opposite of vasoconstriction, which is the narrowing of blood vessels.\nWhen blood vessels dilate, the flow of blood is increased due to a decrease in vascular resistance and increase in cardiac output. Vascular resistance is the amount of force circulating blood must overcome in order to allow perfusion of body tissues. Narrow vessels create more vascular resistance, while dilated vessels decrease vascular resistance. Vasodilation acts to increase cardiac output by decreasing afterload, \u2212one of the four determinants of cardiac output.\nBy expanding available area for blood to circulate, vasodilation decreases blood pressure. The response may be intrinsic (due to local processes in the surrounding tissue) or extrinsic (due to hormones or the nervous system). In addition, the response may be localized to a specific organ (depending on the metabolic needs of a particular tissue, as during strenuous exercise), or it may be systemic (seen throughout the entire systemic circulation).\nEndogenous substances and drugs that cause vasodilation are termed vasodilators. Many of these substances are neurotransmitters released by perivascular nerves of the autonomic nervous system Baroreceptors sense blood pressure and allow adaptation via the mechanisms of vasoconstriction or vasodilation to maintain homeostasis.\n\nFunction[edit]\nThe primary function of vasodilation is to increase blood flow in the body to tissues that need it most.  This is often in response to a localized need for oxygen but can occur when the tissue in question is not receiving enough glucose, lipids, or other nutrients. Vasodilation, both localized and systemic, also facilitates immune response. Localized tissues have multiple ways to increase blood flow, including releasing vasodilators, primarily adenosine, into the local interstitial fluid, which diffuses to capillary beds, provoking local vasodilation. Some physiologists have suggested that it is the lack of oxygen itself that causes capillary beds to vasodilate by the smooth muscle hypoxia of the vessels in the region.  This latter hypothesis is posited due to the presence of precapillary sphincters in capillary beds.  These approaches to the mechanism of vasodilation have not been found to be  mutually exclusive.\nImmune system[edit]\nVasodilation plays a major role in immune system function. Wider blood vessels allow more blood containing immune cells and proteins to reach the infection site. Vasodilation occurs as part of the process of inflammation, which is caused by several factors including presence of a pathogen, injury to tissues or blood vessels, and immune complexes. In severe cases, inflammation can lead to sepsis or distributive shock. Vasodilation is also a major component of anaphylaxis.\nInflammation causes not only vasodilation but also causes increased vascular permeability, allowing neutrophils, complement proteins, and antibodies to reach the site of infection or damage. Elevated vascular permeability can allow excess fluid to leave blood vessels and collect in tissues resulting in edema; vasodilation prevents blood vessels from constricting to adapt to reduced volume in the vessels, causing low blood pressure and septic shock.\nIn the case of inflammation, vasodilation is caused by cytokines. Interferon gamma, TNF-a, interleukin 1 beta,  and interleukin 12 are a few examples of some inflammatory cytokines produced by immune cells such as natural killer cells, B cells, T cells, mast cells and macrophages. Anti-inflammatory cytokines that regulate inflammation and help prevent negative results such as septic shock are also produced by these immune cells. Vasodilation and increased vascular permeability also allow immune effector cells to leave blood vessels and follow chemoattractants to the infection site via a process called leukocyte extravasation. Vasodilation allows the same volume of blood to move more slowly according to the flow rate equation Q = Av, where Q represents flow rate, A represents cross-sectional area, and v represents velocity. Immune effector cells can more easily attach to selectins expressed on endothelial cells when blood is flowing slowly, enabling these cells to exit the blood vessel via diapedesis.\nAnaphylaxis is a severe allergic reaction characterized by elevated vascular permeability, systemic vasodilation, gastrointestinal dysfunction, and respiratory dysfunction. Anaphylatoxins, specifically complement proteins C3a and C5a, bind to receptors on mast cells and basophils causing degranulation. Granules in these cells contain histamine, platelet-activating factor, and other compounds causing clinical manifestation of anaphylaxis- including systemic vasodilation causing dangerously low blood pressure. Immunoglobulin E, an antibody produced by plasma cells, also binds to receptors on mast cells and basophils causing degranulation.\n\nMechanism[edit]\nA basic understanding of cardiac output, vascular resistance , and blood pressure is necessary to understand the causes and impacts of vasodilation. Cardiac output is defined as the amount of blood pumped through the heart over 1 minute, in units of liters per minute, equal to heart rate multiplied by stroke volume. It is directly related to heart rate, myocardial contractility, and preload, and inversely related with afterload. Elevated vascular resistance due to constricted blood vessels causes in increase in afterload, the amount of force against which the heart must contract. Vasodilation therefore decreases vascular resistance, which decreases afterload, elevating cardiac output and allowing perfusion of tissues. Blood pressure measures how much pressure blood exerts on blood vessel walls; systolic blood pressure measures pressure while the heart contracts (systole), and diastolic blood pressure reflects pressure between contractions (diastole). Mean arterial pressure (MAP)is a weighted average of systolic and diastolic blood pressures, and is a better measurement of perfusion over the duration of the cardiac cycle. Vasodilation works to decrease vascular resistance and blood pressure through relaxation of smooth muscle cells in the tunica media layer of large arteries and smaller arterioles. When vasodilation causes systolic blood pressure to fall below 90 mmHg, circulatory shock is observed.\nVascular resistance depends on several factors, including the length of the vessel, the viscosity of blood (determined by hematocrit) and the diameter of the blood vessel. The latter is the most important variable in determining resistance, with the vascular resistance changing by the fourth power of the radius. An increase in either of these physiological components (cardiac output or vascular resistance) causes a rise in MAP. Arterioles create the most vascular resistance of any blood vessel type, as they are very narrow and possess concentric layers of smooth muscle unlike venules and capillaries.\nVasodilation occurs in superficial blood vessels of warm-blooded animals when their ambient environment is hot; this process diverts the flow of heated blood to the skin of the animal, where heat can be more easily released to the environment. The opposite physiological process is vasoconstriction. These processes are naturally modulated by local paracrine agents from endothelial cells (e.g., nitric oxide, bradykinin, potassium ions, and adenosine), and by the autonomic nervous system and the adrenal glands, both of which secrete catecholamines, such as norepinephrine and epinephrine, respectively.\nSmooth muscle physiology[edit]\nThe tunica media of the walls of arteries, arterioles, and veins is composed of smooth muscle and causes vasodilation and vasoconstriction. Contraction of smooth muscle cells causes vasoconstriction, and relaxation of smooth muscle causes vasodilation. Smooth muscle is innervated by the autonomic nervous system and is non-striated (does not contain sarcomeres). Contraction is dependent on concentrations of Ca in the cytosol, either via Ca,Mg-ATPase from the sarcoplasmic reticulum or voltage-gated calcium channels from the extracellular matrix. Calcium ions bind with calmodulin, activating myosin light-chain kinase which phosphorylates the myosin light-chain. Phosphorylated light-chain myosin interacts with actin filaments forming a cross-bridge, allowing muscle contraction causing vasoconstriction. Vasodilation is caused by myosin-light-chain phosphatase, which dephosphorylates the myosin light chain causing muscle relaxation. Smooth muscle cells can remain contracted without use of ATP due to action of the myosin-binding subunit of myosin light-chain phosphatase. Phosphorylation of this subunit by Rho-kinase prevents it from binding to and dephosphorylating the myosin light-chain, allowing the cell to remain contracted.\nVasodilation is the result of relaxation in smooth muscle surrounding the blood vessels. This relaxation, in turn, relies on removing the stimulus for contraction, which depends on intracellular calcium ion concentrations and is tightly linked with phosphorylation of the light chain of the contractile protein myosin. Thus, vasodilation works mainly either by lowering intracellular calcium concentration or by dephosphorylation (really substitution of ATP for ADP) of myosin. Dephosphorylation by myosin light-chain phosphatase and induction of calcium symporters and antiporters that pump calcium ions out of the intracellular compartment both contribute to smooth muscle cell relaxation and therefore vasodilation. This is accomplished through reuptake of ions into the sarcoplasmic reticulum via exchangers and expulsion across the plasma membrane. There are three main intracellular stimuli that can result in the vasodilation of blood vessels. The specific mechanisms to accomplish these effects vary from vasodilator to vasodilator.\nClass\n\nDescription\n\nExample\n\n\nHyperpolarization-mediated (Calcium channel blocker)\n\nChanges in the resting membrane potential of the cell affects the level of intracellular calcium through modulation of voltage-sensitive calcium channels in the plasma membrane.\n\nadenosine\n\n\ncAMP-mediated\n\nAdrenergic stimulation results in elevated levels of cAMP and protein kinase A, which results in increasing calcium removal from the cytoplasm.\n\nprostacyclin\n\n\ncGMP-mediated (Nitrovasodilator)\n\nThrough stimulation of protein kinase G.\n\nnitric oxide\nPDE5 inhibitors and potassium channel openers can also have similar results.\nCompounds that mediate the above mechanisms may be grouped as endogenous and exogenous.\n\nCauses[edit]\nEndogenous[edit]\nVasodilators \n\nReceptor  (\u2191 = opens. \u2193 = closes)    On vascular smooth muscle cells if not otherwise specified\n\nTransduction  (\u2191 = increases. \u2193 = decreases) \n\n\nEDHF\n?\n\nhyperpolarization \u2192 \u2193VDCC \u2192 \u2193intracellular Ca\n\n\nPKG activity \u2192\nphosphorylation of MLCK \u2192 \u2193MLCK activity \u2192 dephosphorylation of MLC\n\u2191SERCA \u2192 \u2193intracellular Ca\n\n\nNO receptor on endothelium\n\u2193endothelin synthesis \n\n\nepinephrine (adrenaline)\n\u03b2-2 adrenergic receptor\n\n\u2191Gs activity \u2192 \u2191AC activity \u2192 \u2191cAMP \u2192 \u2191PKA activity \u2192 phosphorylation of MLCK \u2192 \u2193MLCK activity \u2192 dephosphorylation of MLC\n\n\nhistamine\nhistamine H2 receptor\n\n\nprostacyclin\nIP receptor\n\n\nprostaglandin D2\nDP receptor\n\n\nprostaglandin E2\nEP receptor\n\n\nVIP\nVIP receptor\n\u2191Gs activity \u2192 \u2191AC activity \u2192 \u2191cAMP \u2192 \u2191PKA activity \u2192\nphosphorylation of MLCK \u2192 \u2193MLCK activity \u2192 dephosphorylation of MLC\nopen Ca-activated and voltage-gated Kchannels \u2192 hyperpolarization \u2192  close VDCC \u2192 \u2193intracellular Ca\n\n\n(extracellular) adenosine\nA1, A2a and A2b adenosine receptors\n\u2191ATP-sensitive K channel \u2192 hyperpolarization \u2192 close VDCC \u2192 \u2193intracellular Ca\n\n\n\n(extracellular) ATP\n(extracellular) ADP\n\n\u2191P2Y receptor\nactivate Gq \u2192 \u2191PLC activity \u2192 \u2191intracellular Ca \u2192 \u2191NOS activity \u2192 \u2191NO \u2192 (see nitric oxide)\n\n\nL-arginine\nimidazoline and \u03b1-2 receptor?\nGi \u2192 \u2193cAMP \u2192 activation of Na/K-ATPase \u2192 \u2193intracellular Na \u2192 \u2191Na/Ca exchanger activity \u2192 \u2193intracellular Ca\n\n\nbradykinin\nbradykinin receptor\n\n\n\nsubstance P\n\n\n\n\nniacin (as nicotinic acid only)\n\n\n\n\nplatelet-activating factor (PAF)\n\n\n\n\nCO2\n-\n\n\u2193interstitial pH \u2192\u00a0?\n\n\ninterstitial lactic acid (probably)\n-\n\n\nmuscle work\n-\n\n\u2191vasodilators:\n\u2191ATP consumption \u2192 \u2191adenosine\n\u2191glucose usage \u2192 CO2\n\u2191interstitial K\n\u2191(extracellular) ATP\n\u2191(extracellular) ADP\n\u2191interstitial K\n\u2193vasoconstrictors:\n\u2191ATP consumption \u2192 \u2193 ATP (intracellular)\n\u2193oxygen \u2192 \u2193oxidative phosphorylation \u2192 \u2193 ATP (intracellular)\n\n\n\nnatriuretic peptides\nprostaglandin I2\nprostaglandin E2\nheparin\n\nvarious receptors on endothelium\n\u2193endothelin synthesis\nThe vasodilating action of activation of beta-2 receptors (such as by adrenaline) appears to be endothelium-independent.\nAutonomic nervous system control[edit]\nAs referenced in the explanation of smooth muscle physiology, smooth muscle within the tunica media is innervated by the autonomic nervous system. The autonomic nervous system (ANS) controls essential involuntary body functions and originates as nerves leaving the brain stem or spinal cord; it contains both sensor and motor nerves. The two divisions of the ANS, the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and the parasympathetic nervous system (PSNS), impact blood vessels differently. Traditionally we understand that these two divisions work against each other, the SNS producing \"fight or flight\" and the PSNS producing \"rest and digest\", but in the case of vascular innervation this line becomes blurred ANS nerves do not directly innervate the vasculature via synapses with muscle cells; instead, they release neurotransmitters that reach target cells and effect smooth muscle contraction or relaxation. Physical characteristics of the SNS and PSNS cause the SNS to have a prolonged, systemic impact on blood vessels, while the PSNS causes short-lived, localized change. SNS stimulation causes a base level of vasoconstriction often referred to as basal neural tone, maintaining blood pressure. Often vasodilation is simply the result of insufficient neurotransmitter to maintain basal neural tone, without the presence of a compound directly causing vasodilation.\nNeurotransmitters can act by binding directly to smooth muscle cells or by binding to endothelial cells mediating the effects of the neurotransmitter. Below is a table summarizing major neurotransmitters involved in regulation of the vasculature.\nNeurotransmitter\n\nSympathetic or Parasympathetic\n\nTarget Cells and Receptors\n\nImpact on Vasculature\n\n\nnorepinephrine (NE)\n\nsympathetic (mostly)\n\nadrenergic receptors \u03b11, \u03b12, \u03b21, \u03b22\n\u03b11- smooth muscle \u03b12- endothelial \u03b21, \u03b22- smooth muscle\n\n\n\u03b11- increase concentration calcium ions, vasoconstricton\n\u03b12- inhibit cAMP, release NO, vasodilation \u03b21, \u03b22- possible vasodilation\n\n\n\nAcetylcholine (Ach)\n\nparasympathetic\n\nnicotonic Ach receptors (nAchRs)\nmuscanaric Ach receptors (mAchRs) - on both endothelial and smooth muscle cells\n\n\nnAchRs- modulate cytokines, counteract inflammation\nmAchRs- endothelial M3 AchR release NO, vasodlation smooth muscle M2 and M3 AchRs reduce release NO, vasoconstriction Note: Ach is quickly broken down, diffused, or undergoes reuptake, impacts are brief and localized\n\n\n\nAdenosine triphosphate (ATP)\n\nsympathetic\n\npurinergic receptors on smooth muscle and endothelial cells\n\nsmooth muscle- increase calcium ion concentration, vasoconstriction\nendothelium- possible role as mediator of hyperpolarization of smooth muscle cells co-released with norepinephrine\n\n\n\nNeuropeptide Y (NPY)\n\nsympathetic\n\nreceptors on endothelial cells\n\ncauses vasoconstriction when co-released with norepinephrine\n\n\nCGRP\n\n?\n\nCGRP1, CGRP2 receptors in endothelium\n\nvasodilation, role in vascular dysfunction if levels are abnormal\nAlso worthy of mention when discussing neural control of vasodilation is the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, or RAAS. The kidneys retain water by reabsorbing sodium ions, or eliminate water by eliminating sodium ions. Sympathetic nervous system activity, reduced blood volume or reduced arterial pressure trigger \u03b2-adrenergic receptors in select kidney cells to release renin, which converts facilitates formation of angiotensin II from its substrate angiotensin. Angiotensin II triggers adrenal glands to secrete aldosterone, a potent vasoconstrictor.\nEpinephrine, either exogenous or endogenous, is another vasoconstrictor released by the adrenal glands in response to stress. It binds to \u03b1 and \u03b2 adrenergic receptors like norepinephrine, causing vasodilation and vasoconstriction in different body parts to redistribute circulation to critical areas.\nCold-induced[edit]\nCold-induced vasodilation (CIVD) occurs after cold exposure, possibly to reduce the risk of injury. It can take place in several locations in the human body but is observed most often in the extremities. The fingers are especially common because they are exposed most often.\nWhen the fingers are exposed to cold, vasoconstriction occurs first to reduce heat loss, resulting in strong cooling of the fingers. Approximately five to ten minutes after the start of the cold exposure of the hand, the blood vessels in the finger tips will suddenly vasodilate. This is probably caused by a sudden decrease in the release of neurotransmitters from the sympathetic nerves to the muscular coat of the arteriovenous anastomoses due to local cold. The CIVD increases blood flow and subsequently the temperature of the fingers. This can be painful and is sometimes known as the 'hot aches' which can be painful enough to bring on vomiting.\nA new phase of vasoconstriction follows the vasodilation, after which the process repeats itself. This is called the Hunting reaction. Experiments have shown that three other vascular responses to immersion of the finger in cold water are possible: a continuous state of vasoconstriction; slow, steady, and continuous rewarming; and a proportional control form in which the blood vessel diameter remains constant after an initial phase of vasoconstriction.

Zimmerman, ... Jerry McLaughlin, in Pediatric Critical Care (Fourth Edition), 2011\n\nAdenosine Triphosphate\nATP is considered the molecular unit of intracellular energy currency. ATP derives its inherent energy secondary to anhydride bonds connecting adjacent phosphate functional groups. Hydrolysis of ATP energy generates energy for all cellular processes. In addition ATP also serves as a cofactor for signal transduction reactions using a variety of kinases as well as adenyl cyclase. Normally cellular ATP concentration is maintained in the range of 1 to 10 mmol/L, with a normal ratio of ATP/ADP of approximately 1000. Totally quantity of ATP in an adult is approximately 0.10 mol/L. Approximately 100 to 150 mol/L of ATP are required daily, which means that each ATP molecule is recycled some 1000 to 1500 times per day. Basically, the human body turns over its weight in ATP daily.39 Transmembrane proton flux through the mitochondrial ATPase synthase complex occurs at an estimated rate of 3 \u00d7 1021 protons per second. This corresponds to ATP reformed at a rate of 9 \u00d7 1020 molecules/sec, or approximately 65 kg ATP recycled per day in a normal resting adult (Figure 74-5).24\n\nAdenosine Triphosphate (ATP) as a Neurotransmitter\nA. Verkhratsky, O. Krishtal, in Encyclopedia of Neuroscience, 2009\n\nAdenosine triphosphate (ATP) is an important extracellular signaling molecule. ATP acts as a neurotransmitter in both peripheral and central nervous systems. In the peripheral nervous system, ATP is involved in chemical transmission in sensory and autonomic ganglia. In the central nervous system, ATP, released from synaptic terminals, induces fast excitatory postsynaptic currents. Postsynaptic action of ATP is mediated by a plethora of ionotropic and metabotropic receptors. Furthermore, ATP also acts as an important mediator in neuronal\u2013glial and glial\u2013glial signaling. All types of glial cells are endowed with diverse ATP receptors, which trigger Ca2+ signaling events and membrane currents. ATP can also act as a \u2018glio\u2019transmitter released from astroglial cells via regulated exocytosis or through plasmalemmal channels.\n\nRNA Polymerases\nHyone-Myong Eun, in Enzymology Primer for Recombinant DNA Technology, 1996\n\ni. Nucleotides.\nATP is by far the preferred nucleotide substrate. Both CTP and UTP are polymerized at less than 5% of the rate obtained with ATP (6). The enzyme does not show any activity with GTP, ADP, and dATP. Cordycepin triphosphate (3\u2032-deoxy-ATP) serves as a chain-terminating substrate.\n\nEukaryotic poly (A) polymerases can utilize NTPs other than ATP, either singly or in the presence of ATP, at less than 1% of the rate for ATP (3). The same is true for rADP and dATP.\n\nPurinergic neurotransmission and nucleotide receptors\nSamuel J. Fountain, in Primer on the Autonomic Nervous System (Fourth Edition), 2023\n\nAbstract\nAdenosine 5\u2032-triphosphate (ATP) is a neurotransmitter of postganglionic sympathetic nerves and nonadrenergic, noncholinergic nerves of the enteric nervous system. ATP can also modulate autonomic reflexes through actions at sensory afferent nerves. Mechanisms exist within nerves for the vesicular storage and exocytotic release of ATP. Once released, the availability and duration of ATP is regulated by cell surface ectonucleotidases that hydrolyze ATP, producing metabolites including ADP and adenosine in the process. The effects of ATP are mediated via activation of cell surface purinergic receptors, namely, P2X and P2Y receptors. P2X receptors are ligand-gated nonselective cation channels activated by ATP and causing membrane depolarization and elevation in intracellular Ca2+. P2Y receptors are G protein-coupled receptors activated by ATP and ADP. Signal transduction mechanisms of P2Y receptors including intracellular Ca2+ signaling and inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity. Postjunctional P2X and P2Y receptors effect neurotransmission by ATP, whereas prejunctional receptors are capable of modulating neurotransmitter release.\n\nCell Metabolism\nMerri Lynn Casem BA, PhD, in Case Studies in Cell Biology, 2016\n\nMeasurement of ATP levels\nATP concentrations were measured using a bioluminescence assay based on the ability of luciferase to produce light in the presence of its substrate luciferin and ATP. There is a linear relationship between the amount of ATP present in the sample and the amount of light produced. Luminescence of a sample is compared with a standard curve of known ATP concentrations. At each time point, 12.5 \u03bcL of the cell sample was added to an equal volume of 10% trichloroacetic acid and vortexed vigorously for 1 min to extract ATP. The mixtures were then neutralized with 1 mL of neutralization buffer, and 10 \u03bcL of sample was reacted with 100 \u03bcL of the luciferin/luciferase mixture. ATP concentrations were normalized and expressed as the ratio of ATP levels in prestarved cells.\n\nMitochondria, 3rd Edition\nGiampaolo Morciano, ... Paolo Pinton, in Methods in Cell Biology, 2020\n\nAbstract\nAdenosine 5\u2032-triphosphate (ATP) is the central metabolite in the energy metabolism of cells and is hydrolyzed to ADP and inorganic phosphate to provide free energy in various cellular processes. ATP also functions as an intracellular signaling molecule. Thus, it is important to know the ATP concentration within cells to understand cellular activities. Here, we describe two methods to detect ATP concentrations in the cytoplasm and mitochondrial matrix using genetically encoded luminescent or fluorescent biosensors. These methods enable quantitative investigation of ATP concentration dynamics in living cells, single cells and cell populations.\n\nOrientia\nDaniel H. Paris, ... Nicholas P.J. Day, in Molecular Medical Microbiology (Second Edition), 2015\n\nEnergy Metabolism\nATP is the universal energy source in all biological systems, and can be synthesized by glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation. The majority of the genes encoding the complexes of the oxidative phosphorylation pathways are present in Orientia; including three proton pumps, the succinate dehydrogenase complex, and the ATP synthase complex [158]. Orientia have five copies of the ATP/ADP translocases, thus they may first exploit host cell ATP available in the cytoplasm via these translocases and subsequently produce ATP self-sufficiently via aerobic respiration when the host ATP pool is depleted [158].\n\nLigases\nHyone-Myong Eun, in Enzymology Primer for Recombinant DNA Technology, 1996\n\n(a) ATP.\nATP is the specific cofactor for the T4 RNA ligase. The Km for ATP is 0.2 \u03bcM in circularization reactions (1) or 12 \u03bcM in ATP-PP; exchange reactions (6). Of the common nucleoside triphosphates, only dATP can substitute for ATP but with only 10\u201320% efficacy.\n\nIncreasing the ATP concentrations up to 100 \u03bcM leads to an increase of ligation efficiency up to 50%. A higher concentration of ATP inhibits the reaction, resulting in excessive accumulation of the AMP-RNA (donor) intermediate. Eventually, however, this condition leads to a higher product yield after a long incubation time (7). At high enzyme and ATP concentrations, adenylylation at the 3\u2032-P of both donor and product occurs as a side reaction. For practical purposes, an ATP concentration of 20 \u03bcM provides the best compromise between ligation and adenylylation (5).\n\nPresynaptic: Mitochondrial and Presynaptic Function\u2606\nUmut Cagin, in Reference Module in Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Psychology, 2017\n\nSignaling Roles of ATP\nATP is present in synaptic vesicles (\u223c0.2 M) and is co-released with ACh. In cultured neuromuscular junctions, the retrograde effects of this co-released ATP potentiate spontaneous vesicular ACh release, and might play a role in synaptic development. It has been suggested that endogenously released ATP modulates intracellular [Ca2+] in perisynaptic Schwann cells of amphibian neuromuscular junctions. It has also been suggested that presynaptic actions of adenosine, derived from hydrolysis of released ATP, contribute to the depression of transmitter release in frog neuromuscular junctions. Although exogenously applied ATP depresses transmitter release in mammalian neuromuscular junctions, the endogenous release of ATP (or the accumulation of adenosine) might not be sufficient to alter evoked transmitter release under physiological conditions.\n\nRelated terms:\nEicosanoid Receptor\nAdenosine Diphosphate\nReactive Oxygen Species\nMitochondrion\nOxidative Phosphorylation\nIn Vitro\nGlutamic Acid\nAdenosine\nAstrocyte\nCell Membrane\nView all Topics\nRecommended publications\n\nNew Scientist\nNew Scientist\nJournal\nEnzymes (Second Edition)\nEnzymes (Second Edition)\nBook \u2022 2007\nElsevier logo with wordmark\nAbout ScienceDirect\nRemote access\nShopping cart\nAdvertise\nContact and support\nTerms and conditions\nPrivacy policy\nCookies are used by this site.

But beyond preventing the\naccumulation of sweat-induced dirt and bacteria, there is research around the\nnotion of \u2018contrast showering\u2019 that supports the shower\u2019s role as a recovery\ntool. Some experts suggest that showers can potentially alleviate muscle\ntension due to their impact on blood circulation, vouching for the benefits of\nusing either hot or cold water during their cleansing routine.  \n  \nSo, hit the showers and get your recovery started.\n\n##  Why shower after a workout for recovery?\n\nAfter an intense workout, our muscles undergo stress and micro-tears, a\nnatural part of the muscle-building process. During the post-workout period,\nour bodies initiate the recovery phase, where damaged muscle fibers are\nrepaired and strengthened. This repair process is crucial for muscle growth\nand improved performance. One of the best ways to facilitate this recovery\nright at home is through contrast showers or alternating between hot and cold\nwater.\n\nWhat is Contrast Showering?\n\nContrast showering, also known as contrast  hydrotherapy  , is a technique\nwhere an individual alternates between hot and cold water during a shower.\nThis practice is believed to have various benefits for the body, particularly\nin terms of promoting circulation, reducing muscle soreness, and potentially\nboosting recovery after exercise.\n\n  \n\nThe typical pattern involves switching between hot and cold water multiple\ntimes. The process can vary, but a common approach is to start with warm or\nhot water for a few minutes, then switch to cold water for a shorter duration,\ntypically around 30 seconds to a minute. This cycle is repeated several times,\nending with cold water.\n\n  \n\nAdvocates for  contrast showering  and  hydrotherapy  suggest that hot water\nhelps dilate blood vessels and improve blood flow, while  cold water\nconstricts blood vessels, reducing inflammation and potentially aiding in the\nremoval of waste products from muscles. This contrast between hot and cold\ntemperatures is believed to stimulate the body's natural responses and promote\na sense of rejuvenation.\n\nBenefits of cold post-workout showers\n\nIn a  2014 review  spanning multiple studies, it was discovered that cold\nwater immersion not only alleviates soreness and inflammation but also imparts\na revitalizing boost to nearly every system in your body.\n\nThis advantage positions a post-workout cold shower as a great way to amplify\nthe endorphin rush from your exercise, potentially reducing post-training\nmuscle discomfort.  \n  \n\\- Elevates endorphin release\n\n\\- Boosts metabolic performance\n\n\\- Improves circulation\n\n\\- Strengthens the immune system\n\nBenefits of hot post-workout showers:\n\nIndulging in a warm and comforting shower enhances blood circulation,\nrejuvenates cells, and promotes relaxation post rigorous exercise.  \n  \n\n\\- Loosens up stiff muscles\n\n\\- Reduces anxiety\n\n\\- Clears nasal cavities\n\n\\- Promotes healthy skin by clearing toxins\n\n##  The Benefits of Showering Post-Workout\n\nTraining and competition create an overload to stress the body. What everyone\nfrom weekend warriors to pro athletes do after their exercise and workout\nregime can affect their muscle recovery.\n\n  \n\nMuscle Recovery and Relief:\n\nPost-workout showers can be your secret weapon when it comes to  relieving\nmuscle soreness  and stiffness. The warm water helps dilate blood vessels,\nenhancing blood circulation and promoting the delivery of vital nutrients to\nyour muscles. This process aids in the removal of metabolic waste products,\nlike lactic acid, which accumulates during exercise and contributes to that\nfamiliar post-workout ache.\n\nSoothing Inflammation:\n\nThe aftermath of an intense workout can lead to micro-inflammation within your\nmuscles. A post-workout shower, especially one that alternates between warm\nand cold water, triggers a process known as vasoconstriction and vasodilation.\nThis phenomenon helps reduce inflammation, supporting the body's natural\nhealing mechanisms.\n\nMental Relaxation and Stress Relief:\n\nPhysical recovery is not the only benefit a post-workout shower offers.\nExercise can be mentally taxing, especially if you've had a demanding day. The\nshower can be a sanctuary for relaxation, providing a moment of solitude and\ntranquility. The warm water soothes the nervous system, releasing tension and\npromoting a sense of calmness. This not only helps in recovery but also\nimproves sleep quality, a crucial aspect of overall fitness and well-being.\n\nHow to optimize your post-workout shower with hai\n\nOptimize your cool-down routine with the hai smart showerhead for the ultimate\npost-workout rejuvenation.\n\nSpray control:  Bring the gym sauna home to you with our spa-like mist spray,\na blissful way to decompress after a hard workout. The warm steam helps relax\nmuscles, soothe joints, and alleviate tension. Beyond the physical, the\ntranquil environment encourages mental relaxation, reduces stress, and\nprovides a meditative escape from the demands of daily life.\n\nHandheld shower:  For alleviating discomfort in joints like the shoulder,\nelbow, wrist, knee, hip, and ankle, direct our potent massage spray precisely\nonto the targeted joint region. Hold it for up to 2 minutes, gently performing\nsmall rotations. This technique aims to ease soreness and tension, offering\nrelief to the affected joint area. This will also help increase blood flow to\nthe area.\n\nTemperature notifications & LED light alerts:  Whether you\u2019re a cold plunger\nor sauna goer, set your ideal temp in the hai app and our LED light will let\nyou know when your shower is ready to be hopped into. No more waiting around\nfor your water to warm up\u2014we\u2019ll notify you via app notification when your\nideal temp is reached.\n\nVitamin and aromatherapy-rich shower infusions:  Designed specifically for\nyour post-workout shower, our repair shower infusion jumpstarts your recovery\nby infusing  eucalyptus, citric acid, and vitamin D3  into your shower\u2019s water\nstream. Incorporating essential oils like eucalyptus into your post-workout\nshower provides both mental and physical benefits. The invigorating aroma\npromotes mental clarity and relaxation, while its natural properties help open\nairways and enhance respiratory function. Eucalyptus also offers a cooling\nsensation, soothing muscles, and contributing to a refreshing after-workout\nexperience.\n\nShop Repair\n\nWhen is it best to take a shower post-workout?\n\nJust finished a HIIT class, bike ride, or Pilates session? It's shower time!\nBut hold on a second before you hop in. If you usually rush into the shower\npost-workout, consider giving your tired body a brief pause. Your body\ntypically takes around five minutes to cease sweat production. If you step\ninto the shower during this window, it's advisable to switch to cold water for\na bit. This helps as your pores and veins, having expanded during exercise,\ncan now close back up during this cooling phase.  \n  \nElevate your post-workout routine by adding a refreshing shower to your\narsenal. Beyond the physical cleanse, a well-timed shower can promote muscle\nrecovery, enhance circulation, and provide a rejuvenating mental break after\nintense exercise, setting the stage for a more balanced and revitalized you.\nSo go, hit the showers.\n\nBack to blog\n\n##  Keep Reading\n\n##\n\n12.12.23\n\n###  Celebrating hai's Award-Winning Smart Showerhead\n\nhai is making waves in the world of home innovation, proving itself as an\nindustry innovator.\n\n12.12.23\n\n###  6 Stretches You Can Do in the Shower\n\nA few simple shower stretches to get your body moving.\n\n12.12.23\n\n###  How to Clean Your hai Smart Showerhead\n\nSimple tips and tricks to make cleaning your hai a breeze.\n\n12.12.23\n\n###  World Water Day 2023: hai Announces Partnership with Clean the World\nFoundation\n\nClean the World Foundation is leading a global hygiene revolution.\n\n####  Join the hai community\n\nEmail\n\nSubscribe\n\n  * Shop \n  * Our Story \n  * The Source \n  * Ambassadors \n  * Trade Program \n  * Contact \n\n  * FAQ \n  * Privacy Policy \n  * Terms and Conditions \n  * Terms of Service \n  * Refund Policy \n\n* *   * Twitter \n  * Instagram \n  * Facebook \n  * Screenshot_2  Translation missing: en.general.social.links.spotify \n  * TikTok \n\nCart\n\nYOUR CART IS EMPTY.

These are connected by  edges  ,\nwhich model the  synapses  in a brain. Each artificial neuron receives signals\nfrom connected neurons, then processes them and sends a signal to other\nconnected neurons. The \"signal\" is a  real number  , and the output of each\nneuron is computed by some non-linear function of the sum of its inputs,\ncalled the  activation function  . The strength of the signal at each\nconnection is determined by a  weight  , which adjusts during the learning\nprocess.\n\nTypically, neurons are aggregated into layers. Different layers may perform\ndifferent transformations on their inputs. Signals travel from the first layer\n(the  input layer  ) to the last layer (the  output layer  ), possibly passing\nthrough multiple intermediate layers (  hidden layers  ). A network is\ntypically called a deep neural network if it has at least 2 hidden layers.\n[3]\n\nArtificial neural networks are used for various tasks, including  predictive\nmodeling  ,  adaptive control  , and solving problems in  artificial\nintelligence  . They can learn from experience, and can derive conclusions\nfrom a complex and seemingly unrelated set of information.\n\n##  Training  [  edit  ]\n\nNeural networks are typically trained through  empirical risk minimization  .\nThis method is based on the idea of optimizing the network's parameters to\nminimize the difference, or empirical risk, between the predicted output and\nthe actual target values in a given dataset.  [4]  Gradient based methods such\nas  backpropagation  are usually used to estimate the parameters of the\nnetwork.  [4]  During the training phase, ANNs learn from  labeled  training\ndata by iteratively updating their parameters to minimize a defined  loss\nfunction  .  [5]  This method allows the network to generalize to unseen data.\n\nSimplified example of training a neural network in object detection: The\nnetwork is trained by multiple images that are known to depict  starfish  and\nsea urchins  , which are correlated with \"nodes\" that represent visual\nfeatures  . The starfish match with a ringed texture and a star outline,\nwhereas most sea urchins match with a striped texture and oval shape. However,\nthe instance of a ring textured sea urchin creates a weakly weighted\nassociation between them.\n\nSubsequent run of the network on an input image (left):  [6]  The network\ncorrectly detects the starfish. However, the weakly weighted association\nbetween ringed texture and sea urchin also confers a weak signal to the latter\nfrom one of two intermediate nodes. In addition, a shell that was not included\nin the training gives a weak signal for the oval shape, also resulting in a\nweak signal for the sea urchin output. These weak signals may result in a\nfalse positive  result for sea urchin.  \nIn reality, textures and outlines would not be represented by single nodes,\nbut rather by associated weight patterns of multiple nodes.\n\n##  History  [  edit  ]\n\nMain article:  History of artificial neural networks\n\nHistorically, digital computers evolved from the  von Neumann model  , and\noperate via the execution of explicit instructions via access to memory by a\nnumber of processors. Neural networks, on the other hand, originated from\nefforts to model information processing in biological systems through the\nframework of  connectionism  . Unlike the von Neumann model, connectionist\ncomputing does not separate memory and processing.\n\nThe simplest kind of  feedforward neural network  (FNN) is a linear network,\nwhich consists of a single layer of output nodes; the inputs are fed directly\nto the outputs via a series of weights. The sum of the products of the weights\nand the inputs is calculated at each node. The  mean squared errors  between\nthese calculated outputs and the given target values are minimized by creating\nan adjustment to the weights. This technique has been known for over two\ncenturies as the  method of least squares  or  linear regression  . It was\nused as a means of finding a good rough linear fit to a set of points by\nLegendre  (1805) and  Gauss  (1795) for the prediction of planetary movement.\n[7]  [8]  [9]  [10]  [11]\n\nWarren McCulloch  and  Walter Pitts  [12]  (1943) also considered a non-\nlearning computational model for neural networks.  [13]\n\nIn the late 1940s,  D. O. Hebb  [14]  created a learning  hypothesis  based on\nthe mechanism of  neural plasticity  that became known as  Hebbian learning  .\nHebbian learning is considered to be a 'typical'  unsupervised learning  rule\nand its later variants were early models for  long term potentiation  . These\nideas started being applied to computational models in 1948 with Turing's \"\nunorganized machines  \". Farley and  Wesley A. Clark  [15]  were the first to\nsimulate a Hebbian network in 1954 at MIT. They used computational machines,\nthen called \"calculators\". Other neural network computational machines were\ncreated by Rochester, Holland, Habit, and Duda  [16]  in 1956. In 1958,\npsychologist  Frank Rosenblatt  invented the  perceptron  , the first\nimplemented artificial neural network,  [17]  [18]  [19]  [20]  funded by the\nUnited States  Office of Naval Research  .  [21]\n\nThe invention of the perceptron raised public excitement for research in\nArtificial Neural Networks, causing the US government to drastically increase\nfunding into deep learning research. This led to \"the golden age of AI\" fueled\nby the optimistic claims made by computer scientists regarding the ability of\nperceptrons to emulate human intelligence.  [22]  For example, in 1957 Herbert\nSimon famously said:  [22]\n\n> It is not my aim to surprise or shock you\u2014but the simplest way I can\n> summarize is to say that there are now in the world machines that think,\n> that learn and that create. Moreover, their ability to do these things is\n> going to increase rapidly until\u2014in a visible future\u2014the range of problems\n> they can handle will be coextensive with the range to which the human mind\n> has been applied.\n\nHowever, this wasn't the case as research stagnated in the United States\nfollowing the work of  Minsky  and  Papert  (1969),  [23]  who discovered that\nbasic perceptrons were incapable of processing the exclusive-or circuit and\nthat computers lacked sufficient power to train useful neural networks. This,\nalong with other factors such as the 1973  Lighthill report  by  James\nLighthill  stating that research in Artificial Intelligence has not \"produced\nthe major impact that was then promised,\" shutting funding in research into\nthe field of AI in all but two universities in the UK and in many major\ninstitutions across the world.  [24]  This ushered an era called the  AI\nWinter  with reduced research into connectionism due to a decrease in\ngovernment funding and an increased stress on  symbolic artificial\nintelligence  in the United States and other Western countries.  [25]  [24]\n\nDuring the AI Winter era, however, research outside the United States\ncontinued, especially in Eastern Europe. By the time Minsky and Papert's book\non  Perceptrons  came out, methods for training  multilayer perceptrons\n(MLPs) were already known. The first  deep learning  MLP was published by\nAlexey Grigorevich Ivakhnenko  and Valentin Lapa in 1965, as the  Group Method\nof Data Handling  .  [26]  [27]  [28]  The first deep learning MLP trained by\nstochastic gradient descent  [29]  was published in 1967 by Shun'ichi Amari.\n[30]  [31]  In computer experiments conducted by Amari's student Saito, a five\nlayer MLP with two modifiable layers learned useful  internal representations\nto classify non-linearily separable pattern classes.  [31]\n\nSelf-organizing maps  (SOMs) were described by  Teuvo Kohonen  in 1982.  [32]\n[33]  SOMs are neurophysiologically inspired  [34]  neural networks that learn\nlow-dimensional  representations of high-dimensional data while preserving the\ntopological structure  of the data. They are trained using  competitive\nlearning  .  [32]\n\nThe  convolutional neural network  (CNN) architecture with convolutional\nlayers and downsampling layers was introduced by  Kunihiko Fukushima  in 1980.\n[35]  He called it the  neocognitron  . In 1969, he also introduced the  ReLU\n(rectified linear unit)  activation function  .  [36]  [10]  The rectifier has\nbecome the most popular activation function for CNNs and  deep neural networks\nin general.  [37]  CNNs have become an essential tool for  computer vision  .\n\nA key in later advances in artificial neural network research was the\nbackpropagation  algorithm, an efficient application of the  Leibniz  chain\nrule  (1673)  [38]  to networks of differentiable nodes.  [10]  It is also\nknown as the reverse mode of  automatic differentiation  or  reverse\naccumulation  , due to  Seppo Linnainmaa  (1970).  [39]  [40]  [41]  [42]\n[10]  The term \"back-propagating errors\" was introduced in 1962 by Frank\nRosenblatt,  [43]  [10]  but he did not have an implementation of this\nprocedure, although  Henry J. Kelley  [44]  and  Bryson  [45]  had  dynamic\nprogramming  based continuous precursors of backpropagation  [26]  [46]  [47]\n[48]  already in 1960\u201361 in the context of  control theory  .  [10]  In 1973,\nDreyfus used backpropagation to adapt  parameters  of controllers in\nproportion to error gradients.  [49]  In 1982,  Paul Werbos  applied\nbackpropagation to MLPs in the way that has become standard.  [50]  [46]  In\n1986  Rumelhart  ,  Hinton  and  Williams  showed that backpropagation learned\ninteresting internal representations of words as feature vectors when trained\nto predict the next word in a sequence.  [51]\n\nIn the late 1970s to early 1980s, interest briefly emerged in theoretically\ninvestigating the  Ising model  created by  Wilhelm Lenz  (1920) and  Ernst\nIsing  (1925)  [52]  in relation to  Cayley tree topologies and large neural\nnetworks  . The Ising model is essentially a non-learning artificial\nrecurrent neural network  (RNN) consisting of neuron-like threshold elements.\n[10]  In 1972,  Shun'ichi Amari  described an adaptive version of this\narchitecture,  [53]  [10]  In 1981, the Ising model was solved exactly by\nPeter Barth for the general case of closed Cayley trees (with loops) with an\narbitrary branching ratio  [54]  and found to exhibit unusual  phase\ntransition  behavior in its local-apex and long-range site-site correlations.\n[55]  [56]  John Hopfield  popularised this architecture in 1982,  [57]  and\nit is now known as a  Hopfield network  .\n\nThe  time delay neural network  (TDNN) of  Alex Waibel  (1987) combined\nconvolutions and weight sharing and backpropagation.  [58]  [59]  In 1988, Wei\nZhang et al. applied backpropagation to a CNN (a simplified Neocognitron with\nconvolutional interconnections between the image feature layers and the last\nfully connected layer) for alphabet recognition.  [60]  [61]  In 1989,  Yann\nLeCun  et al. trained a CNN to  recognize handwritten ZIP codes  on mail.\n[62]  In 1992,  max-pooling  for CNNs was introduced by Juan Weng et al. to\nhelp with least-shift invariance and tolerance to deformation to aid  3D\nobject recognition  .  [63]  [64]  [65]  LeNet-5 (1998), a 7-level CNN by\nYann LeCun  et al.,  [66]  that classifies digits, was applied by several\nbanks to recognize hand-written numbers on checks digitized in 32x32 pixel\nimages.\n\nFrom 1988 onward,  [67]  [68]  the use of neural networks transformed the\nfield of  protein structure prediction  , in particular when the first\ncascading networks were trained on  profiles  (matrices) produced by multiple\nsequence alignments  .  [69]\n\nIn 1991,  Sepp Hochreiter  's diploma thesis  [70]  identified and analyzed\nthe  vanishing gradient problem  [70]  [71]  and proposed recurrent  residual\nconnections to solve it. His thesis was called \"one of the most important\ndocuments in the history of machine learning\" by his supervisor  Juergen\nSchmidhuber  .  [10]\n\nIn 1991, Juergen Schmidhuber published adversarial neural networks that\ncontest with each other in the form of a  zero-sum game  , where one network's\ngain is the other network's loss.  [72]  [73]  [74]  The first network is a\ngenerative model  that models a  probability distribution  over output\npatterns. The second network learns by  gradient descent  to predict the\nreactions of the environment to these patterns. This was called \"artificial\ncuriosity.\"\n\nIn 1992, Juergen Schmidhuber proposed a hierarchy of RNNs pre-trained one\nlevel at a time by  self-supervised learning  .  [75]  It uses  predictive\ncoding  to learn  internal representations  at multiple self-organizing time\nscales. This can substantially facilitate downstream deep learning. The RNN\nhierarchy can be  collapsed  into a single RNN, by  distilling  a higher level\nchunker  network into a lower level  automatizer  network.  [75]  [10]  In the\nsame year he also published an  alternative to RNNs  [76]  which is a\nprecursor of a  linear  Transformer  .  [77]  [78]  [10]  It introduces the\nconcept  internal spotlights of attention  :  [79]  a slow feedforward neural\nnetwork learns by gradient descent to control the fast weights of another\nneural network through  outer products  of self-generated activation patterns.\n\nThe development of  metal\u2013oxide\u2013semiconductor  (MOS)  very-large-scale\nintegration  (VLSI), in the form of  complementary MOS  (CMOS) technology,\nenabled increasing MOS  transistor counts  in  digital electronics  . This\nprovided more processing power for the development of practical artificial\nneural networks in the 1980s.  [80]\n\nNeural networks' early successes included in 1995 a (mostly) self-driving car.\n[a]  [81]\n\n1997,  Sepp Hochreiter  and Juergen Schmidhuber introduced the deep learning\nmethod called  long short-term memory  (LSTM), published in Neural\nComputation.  [82]  LSTM recurrent neural networks can learn \"very deep\nlearning\" tasks  [83]  with long credit assignment paths that require memories\nof events that happened thousands of discrete time steps before. The \"vanilla\nLSTM\" with forget gate was introduced in 1999 by  Felix Gers  , Schmidhuber\nand Fred Cummins.  [84]\n\nGeoffrey Hinton  et al. (2006) proposed learning a high-level representation\nusing successive layers of binary or real-valued  latent variables  with a\nrestricted Boltzmann machine  [85]  to model each layer. In 2012,  Ng  and\nDean  created a network that learned to recognize higher-level concepts, such\nas cats, only from watching unlabeled images.  [86]  Unsupervised pre-training\nand increased computing power from  GPUs  and  distributed computing  allowed\nthe use of larger networks, particularly in image and visual recognition\nproblems, which became known as \"deep learning\".  [5]\n\nVariants of the  back-propagation  algorithm, as well as unsupervised methods\nby  Geoff Hinton  and colleagues at the  University of Toronto  , can be used\nto train deep, highly nonlinear neural architectures,  [87]  similar to the\n1980  Neocognitron  by  Kunihiko Fukushima  ,  [88]  and the \"standard\narchitecture of vision\",  [89]  inspired by the simple and complex cells\nidentified by  David H. Hubel  and  Torsten Wiesel  in the primary  visual\ncortex  .\n\nComputational devices have been created in CMOS for both biophysical\nsimulation and  neuromorphic computing  . More recent efforts show promise for\ncreating  nanodevices  for very large scale  principal components  analyses\nand  convolution  .  [90]  If successful, these efforts could usher in a new\nera of  neural computing  that is a step beyond digital computing,  [91]\nbecause it depends on  learning  rather than  programming  and because it is\nfundamentally  analog  rather than  digital  even though the first\ninstantiations may in fact be with CMOS digital devices.\n\nCiresan and colleagues (2010)  [92]  showed that despite the  vanishing\ngradient problem  , GPUs make backpropagation feasible for many-layered\nfeedforward neural networks.  [93]  Between 2009 and 2012, ANNs began winning\nprizes in image recognition contests, approaching human level performance on\nvarious tasks, initially in  pattern recognition  and  handwriting recognition\n.  [94]  [95]  For example, the bi-directional and multi-dimensional  long\nshort-term memory  (LSTM)  [96]  [97]  of  Graves  et al. won three\ncompetitions in connected handwriting recognition in 2009 without any prior\nknowledge about the three languages to be learned.  [96]  [97]\n\nCiresan and colleagues built the first pattern recognizers to achieve human-\ncompetitive/superhuman performance  [98]  on benchmarks such as traffic sign\nrecognition (IJCNN 2012).\n\nRadial basis function  and wavelet networks were introduced in 2013. These can\nbe shown to offer best approximation properties and have been applied in\nnonlinear system identification  and classification applications.  [99]\n\nIn 2014, the adversarial network principle was used in a  generative\nadversarial network  (GAN) by  Ian Goodfellow  et al.  [100]  Here the\nadversarial network (discriminator) outputs a value between 1 and 0 depending\non the likelihood of the first network's (generator) output is in a given set.\nThis can be used to create realistic  deepfakes  .  [101]  Excellent image\nquality is achieved by  Nvidia  's  StyleGAN  (2018)  [102]  based on the\nProgressive GAN by Tero Karras, Timo Aila, Samuli Laine, and Jaakko Lehtinen.\n[103]  Here the GAN generator is grown from small to large scale in a\npyramidal fashion.\n\nIn 2015, Rupesh Kumar Srivastava, Klaus Greff, and Schmidhuber used the  LSTM\nprinciple to create the  Highway network  , a feedforward neural network with\nhundreds of layers, much deeper than previous networks.  [104]  [105]  7\nmonths later, Kaiming He, Xiangyu Zhang; Shaoqing Ren, and Jian Sun won the\nImageNet  2015 competition with an open-gated or gateless  Highway network\nvariant called  Residual neural network  .  [106]\n\nIn 2017, Ashish Vaswani et al. introduced the modern Transformer architecture\nin their paper \"Attention Is All You Need.\"  [107]  It combines this with a\nsoftmax  operator and a projection matrix.  [10]  Transformers have\nincreasingly become the model of choice for  natural language processing  .\n[108]  Many modern large language models such as  ChatGPT  ,  GPT-4  , and\nBERT  use it. Transformers are also increasingly being used in  computer\nvision  .  [109]\n\nRamenzanpour et al. showed in 2020 that analytical and computational\ntechniques derived from statistical physics of disordered systems can be\nextended to large-scale problems, including machine learning, e.g., to analyze\nthe weight space of deep neural networks.  [110]\n\n##  Models  [  edit  ]\n\n|  This section  may be  confusing or unclear  to readers  .  Please help\nclarify the section  . There might be a discussion about this on  the talk\npage  .  (  April 2017  )  (  Learn how and when to remove this message  )  \n---|---  \n  \nFurther information:  Mathematics of artificial neural networks\n\nNeuron and myelinated axon, with signal flow from inputs at dendrites to\noutputs at axon terminals\n\nANNs began as an attempt to exploit the architecture of the human brain to\nperform tasks that conventional algorithms had little success with. They soon\nreoriented towards improving empirical results, abandoning attempts to remain\ntrue to their biological precursors. ANNs have the ability to learn and model\nnon-linearities and complex relationships. This is achieved by neurons being\nconnected in various patterns, allowing the output of some neurons to become\nthe input of others. The network forms a  directed  ,  weighted graph  .\n[111]\n\nAn artificial neural network consists of simulated neurons. Each neuron is\nconnected to other  nodes  via  links  like a biological axon-synapse-dendrite\nconnection. All the nodes connected by links take in some data and use it to\nperform specific operations and tasks on the data. Each link has a weight,\ndetermining the strength of one node's influence on another,  [112]  allowing\nweights to choose the signal between neurons.\n\n###  Artificial neurons  [  edit  ]\n\nANNs are composed of  artificial neurons  which are conceptually derived from\nbiological  neurons  . Each artificial neuron has inputs and produces a single\noutput which can be sent to multiple other neurons.  [113]  The inputs can be\nthe feature values of a sample of external data, such as images or documents,\nor they can be the outputs of other neurons. The outputs of the final  output\nneurons  of the neural net accomplish the task, such as recognizing an object\nin an image.\n\nTo find the output of the neuron we take the weighted sum of all the inputs,\nweighted by the  weights  of the  connections  from the inputs to the neuron.\nWe add a  bias  term to this sum.  [114]  This weighted sum is sometimes\ncalled the  activation  . This weighted sum is then passed through a (usually\nnonlinear)  activation function  to produce the output. The initial inputs are\nexternal data, such as images and documents. The ultimate outputs accomplish\nthe task, such as recognizing an object in an image.  [115]\n\n###  Organization  [  edit  ]\n\nThe neurons are typically organized into multiple layers, especially in  deep\nlearning  . Neurons of one layer connect only to neurons of the immediately\npreceding and immediately following layers. The layer that receives external\ndata is the  input layer  . The layer that produces the ultimate result is the\noutput layer  . In between them are zero or more  hidden layers  . Single\nlayer and unlayered networks are also used. Between two layers, multiple\nconnection patterns are possible. They can be 'fully connected', with every\nneuron in one layer connecting to every neuron in the next layer. They can be\npooling  , where a group of neurons in one layer connects to a single neuron\nin the next layer, thereby reducing the number of neurons in that layer.\n[116]  Neurons with only such connections form a  directed acyclic graph  and\nare known as  feedforward networks  .  [117]  Alternatively, networks that\nallow connections between neurons in the same or previous layers are known as\nrecurrent networks  .  [118]\n\n###  Hyperparameter  [  edit  ]\n\nMain article:  Hyperparameter (machine learning)\n\nA  hyperparameter  is a constant  parameter  whose value is set before the\nlearning process begins. The values of parameters are derived via learning.\nExamples of hyperparameters include  learning rate  , the number of hidden\nlayers and batch size.  [119]  The values of some hyperparameters can be\ndependent on those of other hyperparameters. For example, the size of some\nlayers can depend on the overall number of layers.\n\n###  Learning  [  edit  ]\n\n|  This section includes a  list of references  ,  related reading  , or\nexternal links  ,  but its sources remain unclear because it lacks  inline\ncitations  .

(  August 2019  )  (  Learn how and when to remove this message  )  \n---|---  \n  \nSee also:  Mathematical optimization  ,  Estimation theory  , and  Machine\nlearning\n\nLearning is the adaptation of the network to better handle a task by\nconsidering sample observations. Learning involves adjusting the weights (and\noptional thresholds) of the network to improve the accuracy of the result.\nThis is done by minimizing the observed errors. Learning is complete when\nexamining additional observations does not usefully reduce the error rate.\nEven after learning, the error rate typically does not reach 0. If after\nlearning, the error rate is too high, the network typically must be\nredesigned. Practically this is done by defining a  cost function  that is\nevaluated periodically during learning. As long as its output continues to\ndecline, learning continues. The cost is frequently defined as a  statistic\nwhose value can only be approximated. The outputs are actually numbers, so\nwhen the error is low, the difference between the output (almost certainly a\ncat) and the correct answer (cat) is small. Learning attempts to reduce the\ntotal of the differences across the observations. Most learning models can be\nviewed as a straightforward application of  optimization  theory and\nstatistical estimation  .  [111]  [120]\n\n####  Learning rate  [  edit  ]\n\nMain article:  Learning rate\n\nThe learning rate defines the size of the corrective steps that the model\ntakes to adjust for errors in each observation.  [121]  A high learning rate\nshortens the training time, but with lower ultimate accuracy, while a lower\nlearning rate takes longer, but with the potential for greater accuracy.\nOptimizations such as  Quickprop  are primarily aimed at speeding up error\nminimization, while other improvements mainly try to increase reliability. In\norder to avoid  oscillation  inside the network such as alternating connection\nweights, and to improve the rate of convergence, refinements use an  adaptive\nlearning rate  that increases or decreases as appropriate.  [122]  The concept\nof momentum allows the balance between the gradient and the previous change to\nbe weighted such that the weight adjustment depends to some degree on the\nprevious change. A momentum close to 0 emphasizes the gradient, while a value\nclose to 1 emphasizes the last change.\n\n####  Cost function  [  edit  ]\n\nWhile it is possible to define a cost function  ad hoc  , frequently the\nchoice is determined by the function's desirable properties (such as\nconvexity  ) or because it arises from the model (e.g. in a probabilistic\nmodel the model's  posterior probability  can be used as an inverse cost).\n\n####  Backpropagation  [  edit  ]\n\nMain article:  Backpropagation\n\nBackpropagation is a method used to adjust the connection weights to\ncompensate for each error found during learning. The error amount is\neffectively divided among the connections. Technically, backprop calculates\nthe  gradient  (the derivative) of the  cost function  associated with a given\nstate with respect to the weights. The weight updates can be done via\nstochastic gradient descent  or other methods, such as  extreme learning\nmachines  ,  [123]  \"no-prop\" networks,  [124]  training without backtracking,\n[125]  \"weightless\" networks,  [126]  [127]  and  non-connectionist neural\nnetworks  .  [  citation needed  ]\n\n###  Learning paradigms  [  edit  ]\n\n|  This section includes a  list of references  ,  related reading  , or\nexternal links  ,  but its sources remain unclear because it lacks  inline\ncitations  .  Please help  improve  this section by  introducing  more precise\ncitations.  (  August 2019  )  (  Learn how and when to remove this message  )  \n---|---  \n  \nMachine learning is commonly separated into three main learning paradigms,\nsupervised learning  ,  [128]  unsupervised learning  [129]  and\nreinforcement learning  .  [130]  Each corresponds to a particular learning\ntask.\n\n####  Supervised learning  [  edit  ]\n\nSupervised learning  uses a set of paired inputs and desired outputs. The\nlearning task is to produce the desired output for each input. In this case,\nthe cost function is related to eliminating incorrect deductions.  [131]  A\ncommonly used cost is the  mean-squared error  , which tries to minimize the\naverage squared error between the network's output and the desired output.\nTasks suited for supervised learning are  pattern recognition  (also known as\nclassification) and  regression  (also known as function approximation).\nSupervised learning is also applicable to sequential data (e.g., for\nhandwriting, speech and  gesture recognition  ). This can be thought of as\nlearning with a \"teacher\", in the form of a function that provides continuous\nfeedback on the quality of solutions obtained thus far.\n\n####  Unsupervised learning  [  edit  ]\n\nIn  unsupervised learning  , input data is given along with the cost function,\nsome function of the data  x  {\\displaystyle \\textstyle x}  and the network's\noutput. The cost function is dependent on the task (the model domain) and any\na priori  assumptions (the implicit properties of the model, its parameters\nand the observed variables). As a trivial example, consider the model  f  (  x\n)  =  a  {\\displaystyle \\textstyle f(x)=a}  where  a  {\\displaystyle\n\\textstyle a}  is a constant and the cost  C  =  E  [  (  x  \u2212  f  (  x  )  )\n2  ]  {\\displaystyle \\textstyle C=E[(x-f(x))^{2}]}  . Minimizing this cost\nproduces a value of  a  {\\displaystyle \\textstyle a}  that is equal to the\nmean of the data. The cost function can be much more complicated. Its form\ndepends on the application: for example, in  compression  it could be related\nto the  mutual information  between  x  {\\displaystyle \\textstyle x}  and  f\n(  x  )  {\\displaystyle \\textstyle f(x)}  , whereas in statistical modeling,\nit could be related to the  posterior probability  of the model given the data\n(note that in both of those examples, those quantities would be maximized\nrather than minimized). Tasks that fall within the paradigm of unsupervised\nlearning are in general  estimation  problems; the applications include\nclustering  , the estimation of  statistical distributions  ,  compression\nand  filtering  .\n\n####  Reinforcement learning  [  edit  ]\n\nMain article:  Reinforcement learning\n\nSee also:  Stochastic control\n\nIn applications such as playing video games, an actor takes a string of\nactions, receiving a generally unpredictable response from the environment\nafter each one. The goal is to win the game, i.e., generate the most positive\n(lowest cost) responses. In  reinforcement learning  , the aim is to weight\nthe network (devise a policy) to perform actions that minimize long-term\n(expected cumulative) cost. At each point in time the agent performs an action\nand the environment generates an observation and an  instantaneous  cost,\naccording to some (usually unknown) rules. The rules and the long-term cost\nusually only can be estimated. At any juncture, the agent decides whether to\nexplore new actions to uncover their costs or to exploit prior learning to\nproceed more quickly.\n\nFormally the environment is modeled as a  Markov decision process  (MDP) with states  s  1  ,  .  .  .  ,  s  n  \u2208  S  {\\displaystyle \\textstyle {s_{1},...,s_{n}}\\in S}  and actions  a  1  ,  .  .  .  ,  a  m  \u2208  A  {\\displaystyle \\textstyle {a_{1},...,a_{m}}\\in A}  . Because the state transitions are not known, probability distributions are used instead: the instantaneous cost distribution  P  (  c  t  |  s  t  )  {\\displaystyle \\textstyle P(c_{t}|s_{t})}  , the observation distribution  P  (  x  t  |  s  t  )  {\\displaystyle \\textstyle P(x_{t}|s_{t})}  and the transition distribution  P  (  s  t  \\+  1  |  s  t  ,  a  t  )  {\\displaystyle \\textstyle P(s_{t+1}|s_{t},a_{t})}  , while a policy is defined as the conditional distribution over actions given the observations. Taken together, the two define a  Markov chain  (MC). The aim is to discover the lowest-cost MC. \n\nANNs serve as the learning component in such applications.  [132]  [133]\nDynamic programming  coupled with ANNs (giving  neurodynamic  programming)\n[134]  has been applied to problems such as those involved in  vehicle routing\n,  [135]  video games,  natural resource management  [136]  [137]  and\nmedicine  [138]  because of ANNs ability to mitigate losses of accuracy even\nwhen reducing the  discretization  grid density for numerically approximating\nthe solution of control problems. Tasks that fall within the paradigm of\nreinforcement learning are control problems,  games  and other sequential\ndecision making tasks.\n\n####  Self-learning  [  edit  ]\n\nSelf-learning in neural networks was introduced in 1982 along with a neural\nnetwork capable of self-learning named  crossbar adaptive array  (CAA).  [139]\nIt is a system with only one input, situation s, and only one output, action\n(or behavior) a. It has neither external advice input nor external\nreinforcement input from the environment. The CAA computes, in a crossbar\nfashion, both decisions about actions and emotions (feelings) about\nencountered situations. The system is driven by the interaction between\ncognition and emotion.  [140]  Given the memory matrix, W =||w(a,s)||, the\ncrossbar self-learning algorithm in each iteration performs the following\ncomputation:\n\n    \n    \n      In situation s perform action a;\n      Receive consequence situation s';\n      Compute emotion of being in consequence situation v(s');\n      Update crossbar memory w'(a,s) = w(a,s) + v(s').\n    \n\nThe backpropagated value (secondary reinforcement) is the emotion toward the\nconsequence situation. The CAA exists in two environments, one is behavioral\nenvironment where it behaves, and the other is genetic environment, where from\nit initially and only once receives initial emotions about to be encountered\nsituations in the behavioral environment. Having received the genome vector\n(species vector) from the genetic environment, the CAA will learn a goal-\nseeking behavior, in the behavioral environment that contains both desirable\nand undesirable situations.  [141]\n\n####  Neuroevolution  [  edit  ]\n\nMain article:  Neuroevolution\n\nNeuroevolution  can create neural network topologies and weights using\nevolutionary computation  . It is competitive with sophisticated gradient\ndescent approaches  [  citation needed  ]  . One advantage of neuroevolution\nis that it may be less prone to get caught in \"dead ends\".  [142]\n\n###  Stochastic neural network  [  edit  ]\n\nStochastic neural networks  originating from  Sherrington\u2013Kirkpatrick models\nare a type of artificial neural network built by introducing random variations\ninto the network, either by giving the network's  artificial neurons\nstochastic  transfer functions, or by giving them stochastic weights. This\nmakes them useful tools for  optimization  problems, since the random\nfluctuations help the network escape from  local minima  .  [143]  Stochastic\nneural networks trained using a Bayesian approach are known as  Bayesian\nneural networks  .  [144]\n\n###  Other  [  edit  ]\n\nIn a  Bayesian  framework, a distribution over the set of allowed models is\nchosen to minimize the cost.  Evolutionary methods  ,  [145]  gene expression\nprogramming  ,  [146]  simulated annealing  ,  [147]  expectation-maximization\n,  non-parametric methods  and  particle swarm optimization  [148]  are other\nlearning algorithms. Convergent recursion is a learning algorithm for\ncerebellar model articulation controller  (CMAC) neural networks.  [149]\n[150]\n\n####  Modes  [  edit  ]\n\n|  This section includes a  list of references  ,  related reading  , or\nexternal links  ,  but its sources remain unclear because it lacks  inline\ncitations  .  Please help  improve  this section by  introducing  more precise\ncitations.  (  August 2019  )  (  Learn how and when to remove this message  )  \n---|---  \n  \nTwo modes of learning are available:  stochastic  and batch. In stochastic\nlearning, each input creates a weight adjustment. In batch learning weights\nare adjusted based on a batch of inputs, accumulating errors over the batch.\nStochastic learning introduces \"noise\" into the process, using the local\ngradient calculated from one data point; this reduces the chance of the\nnetwork getting stuck in local minima. However, batch learning typically\nyields a faster, more stable descent to a local minimum, since each update is\nperformed in the direction of the batch's average error. A common compromise\nis to use \"mini-batches\", small batches with samples in each batch selected\nstochastically from the entire data set.\n\n##  Types  [  edit  ]\n\nMain article:  Types of artificial neural networks\n\nANNs have evolved into a broad family of techniques that have advanced the\nstate of the art across multiple domains. The simplest types have one or more\nstatic components, including number of units, number of layers, unit weights\nand  topology  . Dynamic types allow one or more of these to evolve via\nlearning. The latter is much more complicated but can shorten learning periods\nand produce better results. Some types allow/require learning to be\n\"supervised\" by the operator, while others operate independently. Some types\noperate purely in hardware, while others are purely software and run on\ngeneral purpose computers.\n\nSome of the main breakthroughs include:\n\n  * Convolutional neural networks  that have proven particularly successful in processing visual and other two-dimensional data;  [151]  [152]  where long short-term memory avoids the  vanishing gradient problem  [153]  and can handle signals that have a mix of low and high frequency components aiding large-vocabulary speech recognition,  [154]  [155]  text-to-speech synthesis,  [156]  [46]  [157]  and photo-real talking heads;  [158] \n  * Competitive networks such as  generative adversarial networks  in which multiple networks (of varying structure) compete with each other, on tasks such as winning a game  [159]  or on deceiving the opponent about the authenticity of an input.  [100] \n\n##  Network design  [  edit  ]\n\nUsing artificial neural networks requires an understanding of their\ncharacteristics.\n\n  * Choice of model: This depends on the data representation and the application. Model parameters include the number, type, and connectedness of network layers, as well as the size of each and the connection type (full, pooling, etc. ). Overly complex models learn slowly. \n  * Learning algorithm  : Numerous trade-offs exist between learning algorithms. Almost any algorithm will work well with the correct  hyperparameters  [160]  for training on a particular data set. However, selecting and tuning an algorithm for training on unseen data requires significant experimentation. \n  * Robustness  : If the model, cost function and learning algorithm are selected appropriately, the resulting ANN can become robust. \n\nNeural architecture search  (NAS) uses machine learning to automate ANN\ndesign. Various approaches to NAS have designed networks that compare well\nwith hand-designed systems. The basic search algorithm is to propose a\ncandidate model, evaluate it against a dataset, and use the results as\nfeedback to teach the NAS network.  [161]  Available systems include  AutoML\nand AutoKeras.  [162]  scikit-learn library  provides functions to help with\nbuilding a deep network from scratch. We can then implement a deep network\nwith  TensorFlow  or  Keras  .\n\nHyperparameters  must also be defined as part of the design (they are not\nlearned), governing matters such as how many neurons are in each layer,\nlearning rate, step, stride, depth, receptive field and padding (for CNNs),\netc.  [163]\n\nThe  Python  code snippet provides an overview of the training function, which\nuses the training dataset, number of hidden layer units, learning rate, and\nnumber of iterations as parameters:\n\n    \n    \n    def train(X, y, n_hidden, learning_rate, n_iter):\n        m, n_input = X.shape\n    \n        # 1. random initialize weights and biases\n        w1 = np.random.randn(n_input, n_hidden)\n        b1 = np.zeros((1, n_hidden))\n        w2 = np.random.randn(n_hidden, 1)\n        b2 = np.zeros((1, 1))\n    \n        # 2. in each iteration, feed all layers with the latest weights and biases\n        for i in range(n_iter + 1):\n            z2 = np.dot(X, w1) + b1\n            a2 = sigmoid(z2)\n            z3 = np.dot(a2, w2) + b2\n            a3 = z3\n            dz3 = a3 - y\n            dw2 = np.dot(a2.T, dz3)\n            db2 = np.sum(dz3, axis=0, keepdims=True)\n            dz2 = np.dot(dz3, w2.T) * sigmoid_derivative(z2)\n            dw1 = np.dot(X.T, dz2)\n            db1 = np.sum(dz2, axis=0)\n    \n            # 3. update weights and biases with gradients\n            w1 -= learning_rate * dw1 / m\n            w2 -= learning_rate * dw2 / m\n            b1 -= learning_rate * db1 / m\n            b2 -= learning_rate * db2 / m\n    \n            if i % 1000 == 0:\n                print(\"Epoch\", i, \"loss: \", np.mean(np.square(dz3)))\n    \n        model = {\"w1\": w1, \"b1\": b1, \"w2\": w2, \"b2\": b2}\n        return model\n    \n\n[  citation needed  ]\n\n##  Applications  [  edit  ]\n\nBecause of their ability to reproduce and model nonlinear processes,\nartificial neural networks have found applications in many disciplines. These\ninclude:\n\n  * Function approximation  ,  [164]  or  regression analysis  ,  [165]  (including  time series prediction  ,  fitness approximation  ,  [166]  and modeling) \n  * Data processing  [167]  (including filtering, clustering,  blind source separation  ,  [168]  and compression) \n  * Nonlinear system identification  [99]  and control (including vehicle control, trajectory prediction,  [169]  adaptive control  ,  process control  , and  natural resource management  ) \n  * Pattern recognition  (including radar systems,  face identification  , signal classification,  [170]  novelty detection  ,  3D reconstruction  ,  [171]  object recognition, and sequential decision making  [172]  ) \n  * Sequence recognition (including  gesture  ,  speech  , and  handwritten  and printed text recognition  [173]  ) \n  * Sensor data analysis  [174]  (including  image analysis  ) \n  * Robotics  (including directing manipulators and  prostheses  ) \n  * Data mining  (including  knowledge discovery in databases  ) \n  * Finance  [175]  (such as  ex-ante  models for specific financial long-run forecasts and  artificial financial markets  ) \n  * Quantum chemistry  [176] \n  * General game playing  [177] \n  * Generative AI  [178] \n  * Data visualization \n  * Machine translation \n  * Social network filtering  [179] \n  * E-mail spam  filtering \n  * Medical diagnosis \n\nANNs have been used to diagnose several types of cancers  [180]  [181]  and to\ndistinguish highly invasive cancer cell lines from less invasive lines using\nonly cell shape information.  [182]  [183]\n\nANNs have been used to accelerate reliability analysis of infrastructures\nsubject to natural disasters  [184]  [185]  and to predict foundation\nsettlements.  [186]  It can also be useful to mitigate flood by the use of\nANNs for modelling rainfall-runoff.  [187]  ANNs have also been used for\nbuilding black-box models in  geoscience  :  hydrology  ,  [188]  [189]  ocean\nmodelling and  coastal engineering  ,  [190]  [191]  and  geomorphology  .\n[192]  ANNs have been employed in  cybersecurity  , with the objective to\ndiscriminate between legitimate activities and malicious ones. For example,\nmachine learning has been used for classifying Android malware,  [193]  for\nidentifying domains belonging to threat actors and for detecting URLs posing a\nsecurity risk.  [194]  Research is underway on ANN systems designed for\npenetration testing, for detecting botnets,  [195]  credit cards frauds  [196]\nand network intrusions.\n\nANNs have been proposed as a tool to solve  partial differential equations  in\nphysics  [197]  [198]  [199]  and simulate the properties of many-body  open\nquantum systems  .  [200]  [201]  [202]  [203]  In brain research ANNs have\nstudied short-term behavior of  individual neurons  ,  [204]  the dynamics of\nneural circuitry arise from interactions between individual neurons and how\nbehavior can arise from abstract neural modules that represent complete\nsubsystems. Studies considered long-and short-term plasticity of neural\nsystems and their relation to learning and memory from the individual neuron\nto the system level.\n\nIt is possible to create a profile of a user's interests from pictures, using\nartificial neural networks trained for object recognition.  [205]\n\nBeyond their traditional applications, artificial neural networks are\nincreasingly being utilized in interdisciplinary research, such as materials\nscience. For instance, graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated their\ncapability in scaling deep learning for the discovery of new stable materials\nby efficiently predicting the total energy of crystals. This application\nunderscores the adaptability and potential of ANNs in tackling complex\nproblems beyond the realms of predictive modeling and artificial intelligence,\nopening new pathways for scientific discovery and innovation.  [206]\n\n##  Theoretical properties  [  edit  ]\n\n###  Computational power  [  edit  ]\n\nThe  multilayer perceptron  is a  universal function  approximator, as proven\nby the  universal approximation theorem  . However, the proof is not\nconstructive regarding the number of neurons required, the network topology,\nthe weights and the learning parameters.\n\nA specific recurrent architecture with  rational  -valued weights (as opposed\nto full precision  real number  -valued weights) has the power of a  universal\nTuring machine  ,  [207]  using a finite number of neurons and standard linear\nconnections. Further, the use of  irrational  values for weights results in a\nmachine with  super-Turing  power.  [208]  [209]  [  failed verification  ]\n\n###  Capacity  [  edit  ]\n\nA model's \"capacity\" property corresponds to its ability to model any given\nfunction. It is related to the amount of information that can be stored in the\nnetwork and to the notion of complexity. Two notions of capacity are known by\nthe community. The information capacity and the VC Dimension. The information\ncapacity of a perceptron is intensively discussed in Sir David MacKay's book\n[210]  which summarizes work by Thomas Cover.  [211]  The capacity of a\nnetwork of standard neurons (not convolutional) can be derived by four rules\n[212]  that derive from understanding a neuron as an electrical element. The\ninformation capacity captures the functions modelable by the network given any\ndata as input. The second notion, is the  VC dimension  . VC Dimension uses\nthe principles of  measure theory  and finds the maximum capacity under the\nbest possible circumstances. This is, given input data in a specific form. As\nnoted in,  [210]  the VC Dimension for arbitrary inputs is half the\ninformation capacity of a Perceptron. The VC Dimension for arbitrary points is\nsometimes referred to as Memory Capacity.  [213]\n\n###  Convergence  [  edit  ]\n\nModels may not consistently converge on a single solution, firstly because\nlocal minima may exist, depending on the cost function and the model.\nSecondly, the optimization method used might not guarantee to converge when it\nbegins far from any local minimum. Thirdly, for sufficiently large data or\nparameters, some methods become impractical.\n\nAnother issue worthy to mention is that training may cross some  Saddle point\nwhich may lead the convergence to the wrong direction.\n\nThe convergence behavior of certain types of ANN architectures are more\nunderstood than others. When the width of network approaches to infinity, the\nANN is well described by its first order Taylor expansion throughout training,\nand so inherits the convergence behavior of  affine models  .  [214]  [215]\nAnother example is when parameters are small, it is observed that ANNs often\nfits target functions from low to high frequencies. This behavior is referred\nto as the spectral bias, or frequency principle, of neural networks.  [216]\n[217]  [218]  [219]  This phenomenon is the opposite to the behavior of some\nwell studied iterative numerical schemes such as  Jacobi method  . Deeper\nneural networks have been observed to be more biased towards low frequency\nfunctions.  [220]\n\n###  Generalization and statistics  [  edit  ]\n\n|  This section includes a  list of references  ,  related reading  , or\nexternal links  ,  but its sources remain unclear because it lacks  inline\ncitations  .  Please help  improve  this section by  introducing  more precise\ncitations.  (  August 2019  )  (  Learn how and when to remove this message  )  \n---|---  \n  \nApplications whose goal is to create a system that generalizes well to unseen\nexamples, face the possibility of over-training. This arises in convoluted or\nover-specified systems when the network capacity significantly exceeds the\nneeded free parameters. Two approaches address over-training. The first is to\nuse  cross-validation  and similar techniques to check for the presence of\nover-training and to select  hyperparameters  to minimize the generalization\nerror.\n\nThe second is to use some form of  regularization  . This concept emerges in a\nprobabilistic (Bayesian) framework, where regularization can be performed by\nselecting a larger prior probability over simpler models; but also in\nstatistical learning theory, where the goal is to minimize over two\nquantities: the 'empirical risk' and the 'structural risk', which roughly\ncorresponds to the error over the training set and the predicted error in\nunseen data due to overfitting.\n\nConfidence analysis of a neural network\n\nSupervised neural networks that use a  mean squared error  (MSE) cost function\ncan use formal statistical methods to determine the confidence of the trained\nmodel. The MSE on a validation set can be used as an estimate for variance.\nThis value can then be used to calculate the  confidence interval  of network\noutput, assuming a  normal distribution  . A confidence analysis made this way\nis statistically valid as long as the output  probability distribution  stays\nthe same and the network is not modified.\n\nBy assigning a  softmax activation function  , a generalization of the\nlogistic function  , on the output layer of the neural network (or a softmax\ncomponent in a component-based network) for categorical target variables, the\noutputs can be interpreted as posterior probabilities. This is useful in\nclassification as it gives a certainty measure on classifications.\n\nThe softmax activation function is:\n\n     y  i  =  e  x  i  \u2211  j  =  1  c  e  x  j  {\\displaystyle y_{i}={\\frac {e^{x_{i}}}{\\sum _{j=1}^{c}e^{x_{j}}}}} \n\n  \n\n##  Criticism  [  edit  ]\n\n###  Training  [  edit  ]\n\nA common criticism of neural networks, particularly in robotics, is that they\nrequire too many training samples for real-world operation.  [221]  Any\nlearning machine needs sufficient representative examples in order to capture\nthe underlying structure that allows it to generalize to new cases. Potential\nsolutions include randomly shuffling training examples, by using a numerical\noptimization algorithm that does not take too large steps when changing the\nnetwork connections following an example, grouping examples in so-called mini-\nbatches and/or introducing a recursive least squares algorithm for  CMAC  .\n[149]  Dean Pomerleau uses a neural network to train a robotic vehicle to\ndrive on multiple types of roads (single lane, multi-lane, dirt, etc.), and a\nlarge amount of his research is devoted to extrapolating multiple training\nscenarios from a single training experience, and preserving past training\ndiversity so that the system does not become overtrained (if, for example, it\nis presented with a series of right turns\u2014it should not learn to always turn\nright).  [222]\n\n###  Theory  [  edit  ]\n\nA central claim  [  citation needed  ]  of ANNs is that they embody new and\npowerful general principles for processing information. These principles are\nill-defined. It is often claimed  [  by whom?  ]  that they are  emergent\nfrom the network itself. This allows simple statistical association (the basic\nfunction of artificial neural networks) to be described as learning or\nrecognition. In 1997,  Alexander Dewdney  , a former  Scientific American\ncolumnist, commented that as a result, artificial neural networks have a\n\"something-for-nothing quality, one that imparts a peculiar aura of laziness\nand a distinct lack of curiosity about just how good these computing systems\nare. No human hand (or mind) intervenes; solutions are found as if by magic;\nand no one, it seems, has learned anything\".  [223]  One response to Dewdney\nis that neural networks have been successfully used to handle many complex and\ndiverse tasks, ranging from autonomously flying aircraft  [224]  to detecting\ncredit card fraud to mastering the game of  Go  .\n\nTechnology writer Roger Bridgman commented:\n\n> Neural networks, for instance, are in the dock not only because they have\n> been hyped to high heaven, (what hasn't?) but also because you could create\n> a successful net without understanding how it worked: the bunch of numbers\n> that captures its behaviour would in all probability be \"an opaque,\n> unreadable table...valueless as a scientific resource\".\n>\n> In spite of his emphatic declaration that science is not technology, Dewdney\n> seems here to pillory neural nets as bad science when most of those devising\n> them are just trying to be good engineers. An unreadable table that a useful\n> machine could read would still be well worth having.  [225]\n\nAlthough it is true that analyzing what has been learned by an artificial\nneural network is difficult, it is much easier to do so than to analyze what\nhas been learned by a biological neural network. Moreover, recent emphasis on\nthe  explainability  of AI has contributed towards the development of methods,\nnotably those based on  attention  mechanisms, for visualizing and explaining\nlearned neural networks. Furthermore, researchers involved in exploring\nlearning algorithms for neural networks are gradually uncovering generic\nprinciples that allow a learning machine to be successful. For example, Bengio\nand LeCun (2007) wrote an article regarding local vs non-local learning, as\nwell as shallow vs deep architecture.  [226]\n\nBiological brains use both shallow and deep circuits as reported by brain\nanatomy,  [227]  displaying a wide variety of invariance. Weng  [228]  argued\nthat the brain self-wires largely according to signal statistics and\ntherefore, a serial cascade cannot catch all major statistical dependencies.\n\n###  Hardware  [  edit  ]\n\nLarge and effective neural networks require considerable computing resources.\n[229]  While the brain has hardware tailored to the task of processing signals\nthrough a  graph  of neurons, simulating even a simplified neuron on  von\nNeumann architecture  may consume vast amounts of  memory  and storage.\nFurthermore, the designer often needs to transmit signals through many of\nthese connections and their associated neurons \u2013 which require enormous  CPU\npower and time.\n\nSchmidhuber  noted that the resurgence of neural networks in the twenty-first\ncentury is largely attributable to advances in hardware: from 1991 to 2015,\ncomputing power, especially as delivered by  GPGPUs  (on  GPUs  ), has\nincreased around a million-fold, making the standard backpropagation algorithm\nfeasible for training networks that are several layers deeper than before.\n[26]  The use of accelerators such as  FPGAs  and GPUs can reduce training\ntimes from months to days.  [229]\n\nNeuromorphic engineering  or a  physical neural network  addresses the\nhardware difficulty directly, by constructing non-von-Neumann chips to\ndirectly implement neural networks in circuitry. Another type of chip\noptimized for neural network processing is called a  Tensor Processing Unit  ,\nor TPU.  [230]\n\n###  Practical counterexamples  [  edit  ]\n\nAnalyzing what has been learned by an ANN is much easier than analyzing what\nhas been learned by a biological neural network. Furthermore, researchers\ninvolved in exploring learning algorithms for neural networks are gradually\nuncovering general principles that allow a learning machine to be successful.\nFor example, local vs. non-local learning and shallow vs. deep architecture.\n[231]\n\n###  Hybrid approaches  [  edit  ]\n\nAdvocates of  hybrid  models (combining neural networks and symbolic\napproaches) say that such a mixture can better capture the mechanisms of the\nhuman mind.  [232]  [233]\n\n###  Dataset bias  [  edit  ]\n\nNeural networks are dependent on the quality of the data they are trained on,\nthus low quality data with imbalanced representativeness can lead to the model\nlearning and perpetuating societal biases.  [234]  [235]  These inherited\nbiases become especially critical when the ANNs are integrated into real-world\nscenarios where the training data may be imbalanced due to the scarcity of\ndata for a specific race, gender or other attribute.  [234]  This imbalance\ncan result in the model having inadequate representation and understanding of\nunderrepresented groups, leading to discriminatory outcomes that exasperate\nsocietal inequalities, especially in applications like  facial recognition  ,\nhiring processes, and  law enforcement  .  [235]  [236]  For example, in 2018,\nAmazon  had to scrap a recruiting tool because the model favored men over\nwomen for jobs in software engineering due to the higher number of male\nworkers in the field.  [236]  The program would penalize any resume with the\nword \"woman\" or the name of any women's college. However, the use of\nsynthetic data  can help reduce dataset bias and increase representation in\ndatasets.

Their evolution over the\npast few decades has been marked by a broad range of applications in fields\nsuch as image processing, speech recognition, natural language processing,\nfinance, and medicine.\n\n###  Image processing  [  edit  ]\n\nIn the realm of image processing, ANNs are employed in tasks such as image\nclassification, object recognition, and image segmentation. For instance, deep\nconvolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been important in handwritten digit\nrecognition, achieving state-of-the-art performance.  [238]  This demonstrates\nthe ability of ANNs to effectively process and interpret complex visual\ninformation, leading to advancements in fields ranging from automated\nsurveillance to medical imaging.  [238]\n\n###  Speech recognition  [  edit  ]\n\nBy modeling speech signals, ANNs are used for tasks like speaker\nidentification and speech-to-text conversion. Deep neural network\narchitectures have introduced significant improvements in large vocabulary\ncontinuous speech recognition, outperforming traditional techniques.  [238]\n[239]  These advancements have enabled the development of more accurate and\nefficient voice-activated systems, enhancing user interfaces in technology\nproducts.\n\n###  Natural language processing  [  edit  ]\n\nIn natural language processing, ANNs are used for tasks such as text\nclassification, sentiment analysis, and machine translation. They have enabled\nthe development of models that can accurately translate between languages,\nunderstand the context and sentiment in textual data, and categorize text\nbased on content.  [238]  [239]  This has implications for automated customer\nservice, content moderation, and language understanding technologies.\n\n###  Control systems  [  edit  ]\n\nIn the domain of control systems, ANNs are used to model dynamic systems for\ntasks such as system identification, control design, and optimization. For\ninstance, deep feedforward neural networks are important in system\nidentification and control applications.\n\n###  Finance  [  edit  ]\n\nFurther information:  Applications of artificial intelligence \u00a7 Trading and\ninvestment\n\nANNs are used for  stock market prediction  and  credit scoring  :\n\n  * In investing, ANNs can process vast amounts of financial data, recognize complex patterns, and forecast stock market trends, aiding investors and risk managers in making informed decisions.  [238] \n  * In credit scoring, ANNs offer data-driven, personalized assessments of creditworthiness, improving the accuracy of default predictions and automating the lending process.  [239] \n\nANNs require high-quality data and careful tuning, and their \"black-box\"\nnature can pose challenges in interpretation. Nevertheless, ongoing\nadvancements suggest that ANNs continue to play a role in finance, offering\nvaluable insights and enhancing  risk management strategies  .\n\n###  Medicine  [  edit  ]\n\nANNs are able to process and analyze vast medical datasets. They enhance\ndiagnostic accuracy, especially by interpreting complex  medical imaging  for\nearly disease detection, and by predicting patient outcomes for personalized\ntreatment planning.  [239]  In drug discovery, ANNs speed up the\nidentification of potential drug candidates and predict their efficacy and\nsafety, significantly reducing development time and costs.  [238]\nAdditionally, their application in personalized medicine and healthcare data\nanalysis allows tailored therapies and efficient patient care management.\n[239]  Ongoing research is aimed at addressing remaining challenges such as\ndata privacy and model interpretability, as well as expanding the scope of ANN\napplications in medicine.\n\n###  Content creation  [  edit  ]\n\nANNs such as generative adversarial networks (  GAN  ) and  transformers  are\nused for content creation across numerous industries.  [240]  This is because\ndeep learning models are able to learn the style of an artist or musician from\nhuge datasets and generate completely new artworks and music compositions. For\ninstance,  DALL-E  is a deep neural network trained on 650 million pairs of\nimages and texts across the internet that can create artworks based on text\nentered by the user.  [241]  In the field of music, transformers are used to\ncreate original music for commercials and documentaries through companies such\nas  AIVA  and  Jukedeck  .  [242]  In the marketing industry generative models\nare used to create personalized advertisements for consumers.  [240]\nAdditionally, major film companies are partnering with technology companies to\nanalyze the financial success of a film, such as the partnership between\nWarner Bros and technology company Cinelytic established in 2020.  [243]\nFurthermore, neural networks have found uses in video game creation, where Non\nPlayer Characters (NPCs) can make decisions based on all the characters\ncurrently in the game.

This advice is especially\nimportant for people in vulnerable groups, which includes children, the\nelderly, pregnant women and those who have a weakened immune system.\n\n\"While it is possible that removing the mould and a significant amount of the\nsurrounding product could remove any unseen toxins that are present, there is\nno guarantee that doing so would remove them all.\"\n\nHere's a list of foods that are safe and unsafe to eat when they've grown\nmould:\n\n##  Foods you can eat:\n\n###  Hard salami and dry-cured hams\n\nAccording to the United States Department of Agriculture (  USDA  ), it is\nperfectly normal for foods stored at room temperature such as hard salami and\ndry-cured country hams to sometimes have mould on the surface.\n\nAs such, it's safe to scrape the mould from the surface and consume the meat\nunderneath.\n\n###  Hard cheese\n\nWhen hard cheeses such as parmesan and Grana Padano grow mould, it's unlikely\nthat it would penetrate deep underneath the surface of the cheese, the USDA\nexplains.\n\nWhen consuming a hard cheese that has mould on it, you should cut off at least\none inch around the mould, making sure that the knife you're using doesn't\ncome into contact with the mould.\n\nRecommended\n\n  * Chuck E Cheese\u2019s denies serving leftover pizza despite YouTuber claim \n\nOnce the mould has been removed, you should then cover the cheese in a new\nplastic wrapping when storing it.\n\nAccording to the  American Cheese Society  , the recommended temperature for\nstoring cheese is between 1C and 7C, ideally at the bottom of a vegetable or\nfruit drawer in the fridge.\n\n###  Cheese that's made with mould\n\n(Getty Images/iStockphoto  (  Getty Images/iStockphoto  )\n\nCertain cheeses, such as Gorgonzola, Stilton and Roquefort, are made using\nmould.\n\nIf a cheese contains a mould that was included in the manufacturing process,\nthen it's safe to eat.\n\n###  Firm fruits and vegetables\n\nWhile it isn't advisable to eat soft fruits and vegetables that have grown\nmould, it can be ok when consuming firm produce such as carrots, bell peppers\nand cabbage.\n\n\"If the food is hard like pumpkin and has a low water content, then you can\nsafely cut the mould off, providing you cut at least one centimetre off around\nwhere the mould is,\" outlines New Zealand environmental organisation  Love\nFood Hate Waste  .\n\nWhen fruits and vegetables that are firm have a low water content, this\nhinders the mould from penetrating too deeply below the surface.\n\nRecommended\n\n  * You can buy a pastry that's a mix between a croissant and waffle \n\nThe FSA advises avoiding any fruits and vegetables that are obviously\nrotten/mouldy due to risks from the mould, as toxins may penetrate below the\nsurface.\n\n\"However, if fruit/vegetables are a bit overripe (for example wrinkly apples\nand carrots, brown bananas, slightly mushy strawberries) it is fine to use\nthem in cooking/smoothies/cakes,\" they add.\n\n##  Foods you should be wary of\n\n###  Luncheon and cooked leftover meat\n\nFoods that have a high water content, such as luncheon meats or cooked\nleftover meat, can be harmful to eat if they've grown mould on them.\n\n\"Food with high moisture content can be contaminated below the surface,\" the\nUSDA states.\n\n\"Mouldy foods may also have bacteria growing along with the mould.\"\n\n###  Cooked grains or pasta\n\nThis same rule applies to cooked grains and pasta, which have a high water\ncontent.\n\n###  Soft cheese\n\nWhile some cheeses are safe to eat when they've grown mould, such as hard\ncheeses or cheeses manufactured with mould, the same doesn't go for all\ncheeses.\n\nWhen mould appears on soft cheeses such as Brie and Camembert that weren't\nincluded in the manufacturing process, then it's recommended to discard the\ncheeses immediately.\n\n###  Jam\n\n(Getty Images  (  Getty Images  )\n\nPrime minister Theresa May's recent admission that she removes mould from jam\nbefore eating it sparked a  huge online debate  about the practice.\n\nThe USDA advises throwing away jam if it's grown mould, as the mould could\nproduce a mycotoxin, which is a toxic substance produced by fungus that would\nbe detrimental to consume.\n\n\"Microbiologists recommend against scooping out the mould and using the\nremaining condiment,\" the USDA states.\n\nRecommended\n\n  * The biggest vegan food launches of 2019 so far \n\nHowever, official advice on the health concerns surrounding the practice\nvaries.\n\nIn 2014, mould expert Dr Patrick Hickey informed the  BBC  that it is safe to\nscrape mould off jam before eating the condiment underneath.\n\n###  Yogurt\n\nAs a food item with a high water content, it isn't advisable to eat yogurt on\nwhich mould has started growing.\n\n###  Soft fruits and vegetables\n\nWhile mould can be safely removed from firm fruits and vegetables, this same\ntactic doesn't apply to soft fruits and vegetables such as peaches, tomatoes\nand cucumbers due to the high water content of the foods.\n\n###  Bread\n\n(Getty Images/iStockphoto  (  Getty Images/iStockphoto  )\n\nLeavened bread, containing raising agents such as yeast, contains air pockets\nthat are formed following the fermentation process.\n\nDue to the porous nature of bread, mould can easily spread and contaminate\nbelow its surface.\n\n\"Bread should be safe to consume past its \u2018Best Before\u2019 date but consumers\nshould not eat bread that is mouldy, or remove mould and consume the rest,\"\nadvises the FSA.\n\n\"While consumers may not wish to consume stale bread, it can be used safely in\nsome recipes.\"\n\nSupport free-thinking journalism and attend Independent events\n\n###  Nuts\n\nWhile many people may eat nuts on a daily basis due to the health benefits of\nthe nutritious snack, it's important to be wary not to do so if they've grown\nmould.\n\n\"Foods processed without preservatives are at high risk for mould,\" the USDA\nexplains.\n\nNuts and seeds that have been roasted or salted are more likely to contain\npreservatives and therefore have a lower risk of developing mould.\n\n###  More about\n\nmould  Food  Eat

Our\nbrain is very good at processing visual information about different shapes,\ncolors and brightness variations. However, the meaning of an object is not an\nintrinsic physical feature of the object, but is also defined by internal\nrepresentations in our brain, often based on past experience. Thus visual\nperception is not just the processing of information about the physical\nattributes of what we see, but the combination of these with the internal\nrepresentations the brain already has. How is it that our memory and\nexpectations influence our visual perception? That\u2019s what we are trying to\nfind out.\n\nDr. Tiago Siebert Altavini is a neuroscientist working in the Laboratory of\nNeurobiology at The Rockefeller University. He was an undergrad at the\nUniversity of Brasilia and obtained his PhD from the University of Rio Grande\ndo Norte, where he worked with Dr. Kerstin Schmidt at the University\u2019s Brain\nInstitute. His PhD research focused on the visual connections in the brain and\ntheir influence in patterns of spontaneous brain activity. He currently works\nwith Dr. Charles Gilbert, to investigate the top-down influence of feedback\nconnections on object recognition. The aim of such research is to understand\nthe mechanisms by which expectation influences visual perception.\n\nThe event is free but registration is encouraged.\n\nThis lecture is a Know Science Public Talk.

    "content": "Protein folding is the physical process by which a protein, after synthesis by a ribosome as a linear chain of amino acids, changes from an unstable random coil into a more ordered three-dimensional structure. This structure permits the protein to become biologically functional.\nThe folding of many proteins begins even during the translation of the polypeptide chain. The amino acids interact with each other to produce a well-defined three-dimensional structure, known as the protein's native state. This structure is determined by the amino-acid sequence or primary structure.\nThe correct three-dimensional structure is essential to function, although some parts of functional proteins may remain unfolded, indicating that protein dynamics are important. Failure to fold into a native structure generally produces inactive proteins, but in some instances, misfolded proteins have modified or toxic functionality. Several neurodegenerative and other diseases are believed to result from the accumulation of amyloid fibrils formed by misfolded proteins, the infectious varieties of which are known as prions. Many allergies are caused by the incorrect folding of some proteins because the immune system does not produce the antibodies for certain protein structures.\nDenaturation of proteins is a process of transition from a folded to an unfolded state. It happens in cooking, burns, proteinopathies, and other contexts.  Residual structure present, if any, in the supposedly unfolded state may form a folding initiation site and guide the subsequent folding reactions.\nThe duration of the folding process varies dramatically depending on the protein of interest. When studied outside the cell, the slowest folding proteins require many minutes or hours to fold, primarily due to proline isomerization, and must pass through a number of intermediate states, like checkpoints, before the process is complete. On the other hand, very small single-domain proteins with lengths of up to a hundred amino acids typically fold in a single step. Time scales of milliseconds are the norm, and the fastest known protein folding reactions are complete within a few microseconds. The folding time scale of a protein depends on its size, contact order, and circuit topology.\nUnderstanding and simulating the protein folding process has been an important challenge for computational biology since the late 1960s.\n\nProcess of protein folding[edit]\nPrimary structure[edit]\nThe primary structure of a protein, its linear amino-acid sequence, determines its native conformation. The specific amino acid residues and their position in the polypeptide chain are the determining factors for which portions of the protein fold closely together and form its three-dimensional conformation. The amino acid composition is not as important as the sequence. The essential fact of folding, however, remains that the amino acid sequence of each protein contains the information that specifies both the native structure and the pathway to attain that state. This is not to say that nearly identical amino acid sequences always fold similarly. Conformations differ based on environmental factors as well; similar proteins fold differently based on where they are found.\nSecondary structure[edit]\nThe alpha helix spiral formation\nAn anti-parallel beta pleated sheet displaying hydrogen bonding within the backbone\nFormation of a secondary structure is the first step in the folding process that a protein takes to assume its native structure. Characteristic of secondary structure are the structures known as alpha helices and beta sheets that fold rapidly because they are stabilized by intramolecular hydrogen bonds, as was first characterized by Linus Pauling. Formation of intramolecular hydrogen bonds provides another important contribution to protein stability. \u03b1-helices are formed by hydrogen bonding of the backbone to form a spiral shape (refer to figure on the right). The \u03b2 pleated sheet is a structure that forms with the backbone bending over itself to form the hydrogen bonds (as displayed in the figure to the left). The hydrogen bonds are between the amide hydrogen and carbonyl oxygen of the peptide bond. There exists anti-parallel \u03b2 pleated sheets and parallel \u03b2 pleated sheets where the stability of the hydrogen bonds is stronger in the anti-parallel \u03b2 sheet as it hydrogen bonds with the ideal 180 degree angle compared to the slanted hydrogen bonds formed by parallel sheets.\nTertiary structure[edit]\nThe \u03b1-Helices and \u03b2-Sheets are commonly amphipathic, meaning they have a hydrophilic and a hydrophobic portion. This ability helps in forming tertiary structure of a protein in which folding occurs so that the hydrophilic sides are facing the aqueous environment surrounding the protein and the hydrophobic sides are facing the hydrophobic core of the protein. Secondary structure hierarchically gives way to tertiary structure formation. Once the protein's tertiary structure is formed and stabilized by the hydrophobic interactions, there may also be covalent bonding in the form of disulfide bridges formed between two cysteine residues. These non-covalent and covalent contacts take a specific topological arrangement in a native structure of a protein. Tertiary structure of a protein involves a single polypeptide chain; however, additional interactions of folded polypeptide chains give rise to quaternary structure formation.\nQuaternary structure[edit]\nTertiary structure may give way to the formation of quaternary structure in some proteins, which usually involves the \"assembly\" or \"coassembly\" of subunits that have already folded; in other words, multiple polypeptide chains could interact to form a fully functional quaternary protein.\nDriving forces of protein folding[edit]\nAll forms of protein structure summarized\nFolding is a spontaneous process that is mainly guided by hydrophobic interactions, formation of intramolecular hydrogen bonds, van der Waals forces, and it is opposed by conformational entropy. The process of folding often begins co-translationally, so that the N-terminus of the protein begins to fold while the C-terminal portion of the protein is still being synthesized by the ribosome; however, a protein molecule may fold spontaneously during or after biosynthesis. While these macromolecules may be regarded as \"folding themselves\", the process also depends on the solvent (water or lipid bilayer), the concentration of salts, the pH, the temperature, the possible presence of cofactors and of molecular chaperones.\nProteins will have limitations on their folding abilities by the restricted bending angles or conformations that are possible. These allowable angles of protein folding are described with a two-dimensional plot known as the Ramachandran plot, depicted with psi and phi angles of allowable rotation.\nHydrophobic effect[edit]\nHydrophobic collapse. In the compact fold (to the right), the hydrophobic amino acids (shown as black spheres) collapse toward the center to become shielded from aqueous environment.\nProtein folding must be thermodynamically favorable within a cell in order for it to be a spontaneous reaction. Since it is known that protein folding is a spontaneous reaction, then it must assume a negative Gibbs free energy value. Gibbs free energy in protein folding is directly related to enthalpy and entropy. For a negative delta G to arise and for protein folding to become thermodynamically favorable, then either enthalpy, entropy, or both terms must be favorable.\nEntropy is decreased as the water molecules become more orderly near the hydrophobic solute.\nMinimizing the number of hydrophobic side-chains exposed to water is an important driving force behind the folding process. The hydrophobic effect is the phenomenon in which the hydrophobic chains of a protein collapse into the core of the protein (away from the hydrophilic environment). In an aqueous environment, the water molecules tend to aggregate around the hydrophobic regions or side chains of the protein, creating water shells of ordered water molecules. An ordering of water molecules around a hydrophobic region increases order in a system and therefore contributes a negative change in entropy (less entropy in the system). The water molecules are fixed in these water cages which drives the hydrophobic collapse, or the inward folding of the hydrophobic groups. The hydrophobic collapse introduces entropy back to the system via the breaking of the water cages which frees the ordered water molecules. The multitude of hydrophobic groups interacting within the core of the globular folded protein contributes a significant amount to protein stability after folding, because of the vastly accumulated van der Waals forces (specifically London Dispersion forces). The hydrophobic effect exists as a driving force in thermodynamics only if there is the presence of an aqueous medium with an amphiphilic molecule containing a large hydrophobic region. The strength of hydrogen bonds depends on their environment; thus, H-bonds enveloped in a hydrophobic core contribute more than H-bonds exposed to the aqueous environment to the stability of the native state.\nIn proteins with globular folds, hydrophobic amino acids tend to be interspersed along the primary sequence, rather than randomly distributed or clustered together. However, proteins that have recently been born de novo, which tend to be intrinsically disordered, show the opposite pattern of hydrophobic amino acid clustering along the primary sequence.\nChaperones[edit]\nExample of a small eukaryotic heat shock protein\nMolecular chaperones are a class of proteins that aid in the correct folding of other proteins in vivo. Chaperones exist in all cellular compartments and interact with the polypeptide chain in order to allow the native three-dimensional conformation of the protein to form; however, chaperones themselves are not included in the final structure of the protein they are assisting in. Chaperones may assist in folding even when the nascent polypeptide is being synthesized by the ribosome. Molecular chaperones operate by binding to stabilize an otherwise unstable structure of a protein in its folding pathway, but chaperones do not contain the necessary information to know the correct native structure of the protein they are aiding; rather, chaperones work by preventing incorrect folding conformations. In this way, chaperones do not actually increase the rate of individual steps involved in the folding pathway toward the native structure; instead, they work by reducing possible unwanted aggregations of the polypeptide chain that might otherwise slow down the search for the proper intermediate and they provide a more efficient pathway for the polypeptide chain to assume the correct conformations. Chaperones are not to be confused with folding catalyst proteins, which catalyze chemical reactions responsible for slow steps in folding pathways. Examples of folding catalysts are protein disulfide isomerases and peptidyl-prolyl isomerases that may be involved in formation of disulfide bonds or interconversion between cis and trans stereoisomers of peptide group. Chaperones are shown to be critical in the process of protein folding in vivo because they provide the protein with the aid needed to assume its proper alignments and conformations efficiently enough to become \"biologically relevant\". This means that the polypeptide chain could theoretically fold into its native structure without the aid of chaperones, as demonstrated by protein folding experiments conducted in vitro; however, this process proves to be too inefficient or too slow to exist in biological systems; therefore, chaperones are necessary for protein folding in vivo. Along with its role in aiding native structure formation, chaperones are shown to be involved in various roles such as protein transport, degradation, and even allow denatured proteins exposed to certain external denaturant factors an opportunity to refold into their correct native structures.\nA fully denatured protein lacks both tertiary and secondary structure, and exists as a so-called random coil. Under certain conditions some proteins can refold; however, in many cases, denaturation is irreversible. Cells sometimes protect their proteins against the denaturing influence of heat with enzymes known as heat shock proteins (a type of chaperone), which assist other proteins both in folding and in remaining folded.  Heat shock proteins have been found in all species examined, from bacteria to humans, suggesting that they evolved very early and have an important function.  Some proteins never fold in cells at all except with the assistance of chaperones which either isolate individual proteins so that their folding is not interrupted by interactions with other proteins or help to unfold misfolded proteins, allowing them to refold into the correct native structure. This function is crucial to prevent the risk of precipitation into insoluble amorphous aggregates. The external factors involved in protein denaturation or disruption of the native state include temperature, external fields (electric, magnetic), molecular crowding, and even the limitation of space (i.e. confinement), which can have a big influence on the folding of proteins. High concentrations of solutes, extremes of pH, mechanical forces, and the presence of chemical denaturants can contribute to protein denaturation, as well. These individual factors are categorized together as stresses. Chaperones are shown to exist in increasing concentrations during times of cellular stress and help the proper folding of emerging proteins as well as denatured or misfolded ones.\nUnder some conditions proteins will not fold into their biochemically functional forms. Temperatures above or below the range that cells tend to live in will cause thermally unstable proteins to unfold or denature (this is why boiling makes an egg white turn opaque). Protein thermal stability is far from constant, however; for example, hyperthermophilic bacteria have been found that grow at temperatures as high as 122\u00a0\u00b0C, which of course requires that their full complement of vital proteins and protein assemblies be stable at that temperature or above.\nThe bacterium E. coli is the host for bacteriophage T4, and the phage encoded gp31 protein (P17313) appears to be structurally and functionally homologous to E. coli chaperone protein GroES and able to substitute for it in the assembly of bacteriophage T4 virus particles during infection. Like GroES, gp31 forms a stable complex with GroEL chaperonin that is absolutely necessary for the folding and assembly in vivo of the bacteriophage T4 major capsid protein gp23.\nFold switching[edit]\nSome proteins have multiple native structures, and change their fold based on some external factors. For example, the KaiB protein switches fold throughout the day, acting as a clock for cyanobacteria. It has been estimated that around 0.5\u20134% of PDB (Protein Data Bank) proteins switch folds.\n\nProtein misfolding and neurodegenerative disease[edit]\nMain article: Proteopathy\nA protein is considered to be misfolded if it cannot achieve its normal native state. This can be due to mutations in the amino acid sequence or a disruption of the normal folding process by external factors. The misfolded protein typically contains \u03b2-sheets that are organized in a supramolecular arrangement known as a cross-\u03b2 structure. These \u03b2-sheet-rich assemblies are very stable, very insoluble, and generally resistant to proteolysis. The structural stability of these fibrillar assemblies is caused by extensive interactions between the protein monomers, formed by backbone hydrogen bonds between their \u03b2-strands. The misfolding of proteins can trigger the further misfolding and accumulation of other proteins into aggregates or oligomers. The increased levels of aggregated proteins in the cell leads to formation of amyloid-like structures which can cause degenerative disorders and cell death. The amyloids are fibrillary structures that contain intermolecular hydrogen bonds which are highly insoluble and made from converted protein aggregates. Therefore, the proteasome pathway may not be efficient enough to degrade the misfolded proteins prior to aggregation. Misfolded proteins can interact with one another and form structured aggregates and gain toxicity through intermolecular interactions.\nAggregated proteins are associated with prion-related illnesses such as Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob disease, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (mad cow disease), amyloid-related illnesses such as Alzheimer's disease and familial amyloid cardiomyopathy or polyneuropathy, as well as intracellular aggregation diseases such as Huntington's and Parkinson's disease. These age onset degenerative diseases are associated with the aggregation of misfolded proteins into insoluble, extracellular aggregates and/or intracellular inclusions including cross-\u03b2 amyloid fibrils. It is not completely clear whether the aggregates are the cause or merely a reflection of the loss of protein homeostasis, the balance between synthesis, folding, aggregation and protein turnover. Recently the European Medicines Agency approved the use of Tafamidis or Vyndaqel (a kinetic stabilizer of tetrameric transthyretin) for the treatment of transthyretin amyloid diseases. This suggests that the process of amyloid fibril formation (and not the fibrils themselves) causes the degeneration of post-mitotic tissue in human amyloid diseases. Misfolding and excessive degradation instead of folding and function leads to a number of proteopathy diseases such as antitrypsin-associated emphysema, cystic fibrosis and the lysosomal storage diseases, where loss of function is the origin of the disorder. While protein replacement therapy has historically been used to correct the latter disorders, an emerging approach is to use pharmaceutical chaperones to fold mutated proteins to render them functional.\n\nExperimental techniques for studying protein folding[edit]\nWhile inferences about protein folding can be made through mutation studies, typically, experimental techniques for studying protein folding rely on the gradual unfolding or folding of proteins and observing conformational changes using standard non-crystallographic techniques.\nX-ray crystallography[edit]\nSteps of X-ray crystallography\nX-ray crystallography is one of the more efficient and important methods for attempting to decipher the three dimensional configuration of a folded protein. To be able to conduct X-ray crystallography, the protein under investigation must be located inside a crystal lattice. To place a protein inside a crystal lattice, one must have a suitable solvent for crystallization, obtain a pure protein at supersaturated levels in solution, and precipitate the crystals in solution. Once a protein is crystallized, X-ray beams can be concentrated through the crystal lattice which would diffract the beams or shoot them outwards in various directions. These exiting beams are correlated to the specific three-dimensional configuration of the protein enclosed within. The X-rays specifically interact with the electron clouds surrounding the individual atoms within the protein crystal lattice and produce a discernible diffraction pattern. Only by relating the electron density clouds with the amplitude of the X-rays can this pattern be read and lead to assumptions of the phases or phase angles involved that complicate this method. Without the relation established through a mathematical basis known as Fourier transform, the \"phase problem\" would render predicting the diffraction patterns very difficult. Emerging methods like multiple isomorphous replacement use the presence of a heavy metal ion to diffract the X-rays into a more predictable manner, reducing the number of variables involved and resolving the phase problem.\nFluorescence spectroscopy[edit]\nFluorescence spectroscopy is a highly sensitive method for studying the folding state of proteins. Three amino acids, phenylalanine (Phe), tyrosine (Tyr) and tryptophan (Trp), have intrinsic fluorescence properties, but only Tyr and Trp are used experimentally because their quantum yields are high enough to give good fluorescence signals. Both Trp and Tyr are excited by a wavelength of 280\u00a0nm, whereas only Trp is excited by a wavelength of 295\u00a0nm. Because of their aromatic character, Trp and Tyr residues are often found fully or partially buried in the hydrophobic core of proteins, at the interface between two protein domains, or at the interface between subunits of oligomeric proteins. In this apolar environment, they have high quantum yields and therefore high fluorescence intensities. Upon disruption of the protein's tertiary or quaternary structure, these side chains become more exposed to the hydrophilic environment of the solvent, and their quantum yields decrease, leading to low fluorescence intensities. For Trp residues, the wavelength of their maximal fluorescence emission also depend on their environment.\nFluorescence spectroscopy can be used to characterize the equilibrium unfolding of proteins by measuring the variation in the intensity of fluorescence emission or in the wavelength of maximal emission as functions of a denaturant value. The denaturant can be a chemical molecule (urea, guanidinium hydrochloride), temperature, pH, pressure, etc. The equilibrium between the different but discrete protein states, i.e. native state, intermediate states, unfolded state, depends on the denaturant value; therefore, the global fluorescence signal of their equilibrium mixture also depends on this value. One thus obtains a profile relating the global protein signal to the denaturant value. The profile of equilibrium unfolding may enable one to detect and identify intermediates of unfolding. General equations have been developed by Hugues Bedouelle to obtain the thermodynamic parameters that characterize the unfolding equilibria for homomeric or heteromeric proteins, up to trimers and potentially tetramers, from such profiles. Fluorescence spectroscopy can be combined with fast-mixing devices such as stopped flow, to measure protein folding kinetics, generate a chevron plot and derive a Phi value analysis.\nCircular dichroism[edit]\n\nMain article: Circular dichroism\nCircular dichroism is one of the most general and basic tools to study protein folding. Circular dichroism spectroscopy measures the absorption of circularly polarized light. In proteins, structures such as alpha helices and beta sheets are chiral, and thus absorb such light. The absorption of this light acts as a marker of the degree of foldedness of the protein ensemble. This technique has been used to measure equilibrium unfolding of the protein by measuring the change in this absorption as a function of denaturant concentration or temperature. A denaturant melt measures the free energy of unfolding as well as the protein's m value, or denaturant dependence. A temperature melt measures the denaturation temperature (Tm) of the protein. As for fluorescence spectroscopy, circular-dichroism spectroscopy can be combined with fast-mixing devices such as stopped flow to measure protein folding kinetics and to generate chevron plots.\nVibrational circular dichroism of proteins[edit]\nThe more recent developments of vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) techniques for proteins, currently involving Fourier transform (FT) instruments, provide powerful means for determining protein conformations in solution even for very large protein molecules. Such VCD studies of proteins can be combined with X-ray diffraction data for protein crystals, FT-IR data for protein solutions in heavy water (D2O), or quantum computations.\nProtein nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy[edit]\n\nMain article: Protein NMR\nProtein nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is able to collect protein structural data by inducing a magnet field through samples of concentrated protein. In NMR, depending on the chemical environment, certain nuclei will absorb specific radio-frequencies. Because protein structural changes operate on a time scale from ns to ms, NMR is especially equipped to study intermediate structures in timescales of ps to s. Some of the main techniques for studying proteins structure and non-folding protein structural changes include COSY, TOCSY,\u00a0HSQC, time relaxation (T1 & T2), and NOE. NOE is especially useful because magnetization transfers can be observed between spatially proximal hydrogens are observed. Different NMR experiments have varying degrees of timescale sensitivity that are appropriate for different protein structural changes. NOE can pick up bond vibrations or side chain rotations, however, NOE is too sensitive to pick up protein folding because it occurs at larger timescale.\nTimescale of protein structural changes matched with NMR experiments. For protein folding, CPMG Relaxation Dispersion (CPMG RD) and chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) collect data in the appropriate timescale.\nBecause protein folding takes place in about 50 to 3000 s CPMG Relaxation dispersion and chemical exchange saturation transfer have become some of the primary techniques for NMR analysis of folding. In addition, both techniques are used to uncover excited intermediate states in the protein folding landscape. To do this, CPMG Relaxation dispersion takes advantage of the spin echo phenomenon. This technique exposes the target nuclei to a 90 pulse followed by one or more 180 pulses. As the nuclei refocus, a broad distribution indicates the target nuclei is involved in an intermediate excited state. By looking at Relaxation dispersion plots the data collect information on the thermodynamics and kinetics between the excited and ground. Saturation Transfer measures changes in signal from the ground state as excited states become perturbed. It uses weak radio frequency irradiation to saturate the excited state of a particular nuclei which transfers its saturation to the ground state. This signal is amplified by decreasing the magnetization (and the signal) of the ground state.\nThe main limitations in NMR is that its resolution decreases with proteins that are larger than 25 kDa and is not as detailed as X-ray crystallography. Additionally, protein NMR analysis is quite difficult and can propose multiple solutions from the same NMR spectrum.\nIn a study focused on the folding of an amyotrophic lateral sclerosis involved protein SOD1, excited intermediates were studied with relaxation dispersion and Saturation transfer. SOD1 had been previously tied to many disease causing mutants which were assumed to be involved in protein aggregation, however the mechanism was still unknown. By using Relaxation Dispersion and Saturation Transfer experiments many excited intermediate states were uncovered misfolding in the SOD1 mutants.\nDual-polarization interferometry[edit]\n\nMain article: Dual-polarization interferometry\nDual polarisation interferometry is a surface-based technique for measuring the optical properties of molecular layers. When used to characterize protein folding, it measures the conformation by determining the overall size of a monolayer of the protein and its density in real time at sub-Angstrom resolution, although real-time measurement of the kinetics of protein folding are limited to processes that occur slower than ~10\u00a0Hz. Similar to circular dichroism, the stimulus for folding can be a denaturant or temperature.\nStudies of folding with high time resolution[edit]\nThe study of protein folding has been greatly advanced in recent years by the development of fast, time-resolved techniques. Experimenters rapidly trigger the folding of a sample of unfolded protein and observe the resulting dynamics. Fast techniques in use include neutron scattering, ultrafast mixing of solutions, photochemical methods, and laser temperature jump spectroscopy. Among the many scientists who have contributed to the development of these techniques are Jeremy Cook, Heinrich Roder, Harry Gray, Martin Gruebele, Brian Dyer, William Eaton, Sheena Radford, Chris Dobson, Alan Fersht, Bengt N\u00f6lting and Lars Konermann.\nProteolysis[edit]\nProteolysis is routinely used to probe the fraction unfolded under a wide range of solution conditions (e.g. fast parallel proteolysis (FASTpp).\nSingle-molecule force spectroscopy[edit]\nSingle molecule techniques such as optical tweezers and AFM have been used to understand protein folding mechanisms of isolated proteins as well as proteins with chaperones. Optical tweezers have been used to stretch single protein molecules from their C- and N-termini and unfold them to allow study of the subsequent refolding. The technique allows one to measure folding rates at single-molecule level; for example, optical tweezers have been recently applied to study folding and unfolding of proteins involved in blood coagulation. von Willebrand factor (vWF) is a protein with an essential role in blood clot formation process. It discovered \u2013 using single molecule optical tweezers measurement \u2013 that calcium-bound vWF acts as a shear force sensor in the blood. Shear force leads to unfolding of the A2 domain of vWF, whose refolding rate is dramatically enhanced in the presence of calcium. Recently, it was also shown that the simple src SH3 domain accesses multiple unfolding pathways under force.\nBiotin painting[edit]\nBiotin painting enables condition-specific cellular snapshots of (un)folded proteins. Biotin 'painting' shows a bias towards predicted Intrinsically disordered proteins.\n\nComputational studies of protein folding[edit]\nComputational studies of protein folding includes three main aspects related to the prediction of protein stability, kinetics, and structure. A 2013 review summarizes the available computational methods for protein folding.\nLevinthal's paradox[edit]\nIn 1969, Cyrus Levinthal noted that, because of the very large number of degrees of freedom in an unfolded polypeptide chain, the molecule has an astronomical number of possible conformations. An estimate of 3 or 10 was made in one of his papers. Levinthal's paradox is a thought experiment based on the observation that if a protein were folded by sequential sampling of all possible conformations, it would take an astronomical amount of time to do so, even if the conformations were sampled at a rapid rate (on the nanosecond or picosecond scale). Based upon the observation that proteins fold much faster than this, Levinthal then proposed that a random conformational search does not occur, and the protein must, therefore, fold through a series of meta-stable intermediate states.\nEnergy landscape of protein folding[edit]\nThe energy funnel by which an unfolded polypeptide chain assumes its native structure\nThe configuration space of a protein during folding can be visualized as an energy landscape. According to Joseph Bryngelson and Peter Wolynes, proteins follow the principle of minimal frustration, meaning that naturally evolved proteins have optimized their folding energy landscapes, and that nature has chosen amino acid sequences so that the folded state of the protein is sufficiently stable. In addition, the acquisition of the folded state had to become a sufficiently fast process. Even though nature has reduced the level of frustration in proteins, some degree of it remains up to now as can be observed in the presence of local minima in the energy landscape of proteins.\nA consequence of these evolutionarily selected sequences is that proteins are generally thought to have globally \"funneled energy landscapes\" (a term coined by Jos\u00e9 Onuchic) that are largely directed toward the native state. This \"folding funnel\" landscape allows the protein to fold to the native state through any of a large number of pathways and intermediates, rather than being restricted to a single mechanism. The theory is supported by both computational simulations of model proteins and experimental studies, and it has been used to improve methods for protein structure prediction and design. The description of protein folding by the leveling free-energy landscape is also consistent with the 2nd law of thermodynamics. Physically, thinking of landscapes in terms of visualizable potential or total energy surfaces simply with maxima, saddle points, minima, and funnels, rather like geographic landscapes, is perhaps a little misleading. The relevant description is really a high-dimensional phase space in which manifolds might take a variety of more complicated topological forms.\nThe unfolded polypeptide chain begins at the top of the funnel where it may assume the largest number of unfolded variations and is in its highest energy state. Energy landscapes such as these indicate that there are a large number of initial possibilities, but only a single native state is possible; however, it does not reveal the numerous folding pathways that are possible. A different molecule of the same exact protein may be able to follow marginally different folding pathways, seeking different lower energy intermediates, as long as the same native structure is reached. Different pathways may have different frequencies of utilization depending on the thermodynamic favorability of each pathway. This means that if one pathway is found to be more thermodynamically favorable than another, it is likely to be used more frequently in the pursuit of the native structure. As the protein begins to fold and assume its various conformations, it always seeks a more thermodynamically favorable structure than before and thus continues through the energy funnel. Formation of secondary structures is a strong indication of increased stability within the protein, and only one combination of secondary structures assumed by the polypeptide backbone will have the lowest energy and therefore be present in the native state of the protein. Among the first structures to form once the polypeptide begins to fold are alpha helices and beta turns, where alpha helices can form in as little as 100 nanoseconds and beta turns in 1 microsecond.\nThere exists a saddle point in the energy funnel landscape where the transition state for a particular protein is found. The transition state in the energy funnel diagram is the conformation that must be assumed by every molecule of that protein if the protein wishes to finally assume the native structure. No protein may assume the native structure without first passing through the transition state. The transition state can be referred to as a variant or premature form of the native state rather than just another intermediary step. The folding of the transition state is shown to be rate-determining, and even though it exists in a higher energy state than the native fold, it greatly resembles the native structure. Within the transition state, there exists a nucleus around which the protein is able to fold, formed by a process referred to as \"nucleation condensation\" where the structure begins to collapse onto the nucleus.\nModeling of protein folding[edit]\nFolding@home uses Markov state models, like the one diagrammed here, to model the possible shapes and folding pathways a protein can take as it condenses from its initial randomly coiled state (left) into its native 3D structure (right).\nDe novo or ab initio techniques for computational protein structure prediction can be used for simulating various aspects of protein folding. Molecular dynamics (MD) was used in simulations of protein folding and dynamics in silico. First equilibrium folding simulations were done using implicit solvent model and umbrella sampling. Because of computational cost, ab initio MD folding simulations with explicit water are limited to peptides and very small proteins. MD simulations of larger proteins remain restricted to dynamics of the experimental structure or its high-temperature unfolding. Long-time folding processes (beyond about 1 millisecond), like folding of small-size proteins (about 50 residues) or larger, can be accessed using coarse-grained models.\nSeveral large-scale computational projects, such as Rosetta@home, Folding@home and Foldit, target protein folding.\nLong continuous-trajectory simulations have been performed on Anton, a massively parallel supercomputer designed and built around custom ASICs and interconnects by D. E. Shaw Research. The longest published result of a simulation performed using Anton is a 2.936 millisecond simulation of NTL9 at 355 K. The simulations are currently able to unfold and refold small (<150 amino acids residues) proteins and predict how mutations affect folding kinetics and stability.\nIn 2020 a team of researchers that used AlphaFold, an artificial intelligence (AI) program developed by DeepMind placed first in CASP. The team achieved a level of accuracy much higher than any other group. It scored above 90 for around two-thirds of the proteins in CASP's global distance test (GDT), a test that measures the degree to which a computational program predicted structure is similar to the lab experiment determined structure, with 100 being a complete match, within the distance cutoff used for calculating GDT.\nAlphaFold's protein structure prediction results at CASP were described as \"transformational\" and \"astounding\". Some researchers noted that the accuracy is not high enough for a third of its predictions, and that it does not reveal the mechanism or rules of protein folding for the protein folding problem to be considered solved. Nevertheless, it is considered a significant achievement in computational biology and great progress towards a decades-old grand challenge of biology.\n\nSee also[edit]\nAnfinsen's dogma\nChevron plot\nDenaturation midpoint\nDownhill folding\nFolding (chemistry)\nPhi value analysis\nPotential energy of protein\nProtein dynamics\nProtein misfolding cyclic amplification\nProtein structure prediction software\nProteopathy\nTime-resolved mass spectrometry"

    "content": "Senescence (/s\u026a\u02c8n\u025bs\u0259ns/) or biological aging is the gradual deterioration of functional characteristics in living organisms. The word senescence can refer to either cellular senescence or to senescence of the whole organism. Organismal senescence involves an increase in death rates and/or a decrease in fecundity with increasing age, at least in the later part of an organism's life cycle. However, the resulting effects of senescence can be delayed. The 1934 discovery that calorie restriction can extend lifespans by 50% in rats, the existence of species having negligible senescence, and the existence of potentially immortal organisms such as members of the genus Hydra have motivated research into delaying senescence and thus age-related diseases. Rare human mutations can cause accelerated aging diseases.\nEnvironmental factors may affect aging \u2013 for example, overexposure to ultraviolet radiation accelerates skin aging. Different parts of the body may age at different rates and distinctly, including the brain, the cardiovascular system, and muscle. Similarly, functions may distinctly decline with aging, including movement control and memory. Two organisms of the same species can also age at different rates, making biological aging and chronological aging distinct concepts.\n\nDefinition and characteristics[edit]\nOrganismal senescence is the aging of whole organisms. Actuarial senescence can be defined as an increase in mortality and/or a decrease in fecundity with age. The Gompertz\u2013Makeham law of mortality says that the age-dependent component of the mortality rate increases exponentially with age.\nAging is characterized by the declining ability to respond to stress, increased homeostatic imbalance, and increased risk of aging-associated diseases including cancer and heart disease. Aging has been defined as \"a progressive deterioration of physiological function, an intrinsic age-related process of loss of viability and increase in vulnerability.\"\nIn 2013, a group of scientists defined nine hallmarks of aging that are common between organisms with emphasis on mammals:\ngenomic instability,\ntelomere attrition,\nepigenetic alterations,\nloss of proteostasis,\nderegulated nutrient sensing,\nmitochondrial dysfunction,\ncellular senescence,\nstem cell exhaustion,\naltered intercellular communication\nIn a decadal update, three hallmarks have been added, totaling 12 proposed hallmarks:\ndisabled macroautophagy\nchronic inflammation\ndysbiosis\nThe environment induces damage at various levels, e.g. damage to DNA, and damage to tissues and cells by oxygen radicals (widely known as free radicals), and some of this damage is not repaired and thus accumulates with time. Cloning from somatic cells rather than germ cells may begin life with a higher initial load of damage. Dolly the sheep died young from a contagious lung disease, but data on an entire population of cloned individuals would be necessary to measure mortality rates and quantify aging.\nThe evolutionary theorist George Williams wrote, \"It is remarkable that after a seemingly miraculous feat of morphogenesis, a complex metazoan should be unable to perform the much simpler task of merely maintaining what is already formed.\"\n\nVariation among species[edit]\n\nFurther information: Longevity \u00a7\u00a0Non-human biological longevity\nDifferent speeds with which mortality increases with age correspond to different maximum life span among species. For example, a mouse is elderly at 3 years, a human is elderly at 80 years, and ginkgo trees show little effect of age even at 667 years.\nAlmost all organisms senesce, including bacteria which have asymmetries between \"mother\" and \"daughter\" cells upon cell division, with the mother cell experiencing aging, while the daughter is rejuvenated. There is negligible senescence in some groups, such as the genus Hydra. Planarian flatworms have \"apparently limitless telomere regenerative capacity fueled by a population of highly proliferative adult stem cells.\" These planarians are not biologically immortal, but rather their death rate slowly increases with age. Organisms that are thought to be biologically immortal would, in one instance, be Turritopsis dohrnii, also known as the \"immortal jellyfish\", due to its ability to revert to its youth when it undergoes stress during adulthood. The reproductive system is observed to remain intact, and even the gonads of Turritopsis dohrnii are existing.\nSome species exhibit \"negative senescence\", in which reproduction capability increases or is stable, and mortality falls with age, resulting from the advantages of increased body size during aging.\n\nTheories of aging[edit]\nThis section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it.  (March 2023)\nMore than 300 different theories have been posited to explain the nature (mechanisms) and causes (reasons for natural emergence or factors) of aging. Good theories would both explain past observations and predict the results of future experiments. Some of the theories may complement each other, overlap, contradict, or may not preclude various other theories.\nTheories of aging fall into two broad categories, evolutionary theories of aging and mechanistic theories of aging. Evolutionary theories of aging primarily explain why aging happens, but do not concern themselves with the molecular mechanism(s) that drive the process. All evolutionary theories of aging rest on the basic mechanisms that the force of natural selection declines with age. Mechanistic theories of aging can be divided into theories that propose aging is programmed, and damage accumulation theories, i.e. those that propose aging to be caused by  specific molecular changes occurring over time.\nThis section is an excerpt from Stem cell theory of aging \u00a7 Other theories of aging.[edit]\nThe aging process can be explained with different theories. These are evolutionary theories, molecular theories, system theories and cellular theories. The evolutionary theory of ageing was first proposed in the late 1940s and can be explained briefly by the accumulation of mutations (evolution of ageing), disposable soma and antagonistic pleiotropy hypothesis. The molecular theories of ageing include phenomena such as gene regulation (gene expression), codon restriction, error catastrophe, somatic mutation, accumulation of genetic material (DNA) damage (DNA damage theory of aging) and dysdifferentiation. The system theories include the immunologic approach to ageing, rate-of-living and the alterations in neuroendocrinal control mechanisms. (See homeostasis). Cellular theory of ageing can be categorized as telomere theory, free radical theory (free-radical theory of aging) and apoptosis. The stem cell theory of aging is also a sub-category of cellular theories.\nEvolutionary aging theories[edit]\n\nMain article: Evolution of ageing\nAntagonistic pleiotropy[edit]\n\nMain article: Antagonistic pleiotropy hypothesis\nOne theory was proposed by George C. Williams and involves antagonistic pleiotropy. A single gene may affect multiple traits. Some traits that increase fitness early in life may also have negative effects later in life. But, because many more individuals are alive at young ages than at old ages, even small positive effects early can be strongly selected for, and large negative effects later may be very weakly selected against. Williams suggested the following example: Perhaps a gene codes for calcium deposition in bones, which promotes juvenile survival and will therefore be favored by natural selection; however, this same gene promotes calcium deposition in the arteries, causing negative atherosclerotic effects in old age. Thus, harmful biological changes in old age may result from selection for pleiotropic genes that are beneficial early in life but harmful later on. In this case, selection pressure is relatively high when Fisher's reproductive value is high and relatively low when Fisher's reproductive value is low.\nCancer versus cellular senescence tradeoff theory of aging[edit]\n\nMain article: Immunosenescence\nSenescent cells within a multicellular organism can be purged by competition between cells, but this increases the risk of cancer. This leads to an inescapable dilemma between two possibilities\u2014the accumulation of physiologically useless senescent cells, and cancer\u2014both of which lead to increasing rates of mortality with age.\nDisposable soma[edit]\n\nMain article: Disposable soma theory of aging\nThe disposable soma theory of aging was proposed by Thomas Kirkwood in 1977. The theory suggests that aging occurs due to a strategy in which an individual only invests in maintenance of the soma for as long as it has a realistic chance of survival. A species that uses resources more efficiently will live longer, and therefore be able to pass on genetic information to the next generation. The demands of reproduction are high, so less effort is invested in repair and maintenance of somatic cells, compared to germline cells, in order to focus on reproduction and species survival.\nProgrammed aging theories[edit]\nProgrammed theories of aging posit that aging is adaptive, normally invoking selection for evolvability or group selection.\nThe reproductive-cell cycle theory suggests that aging is regulated by changes in hormonal signaling over the lifespan.\nDamage accumulation theories[edit]\nThe free radical theory of aging[edit]\n\nMain article: Free-radical theory of aging\nOne of the most prominent theories of aging was first proposed by Harman in 1956. It posits that free radicals produced by dissolved oxygen, radiation, cellular respiration and other sources cause damage to the molecular machines in the cell and gradually wear them down. This is also known as oxidative stress.\nThere is substantial evidence to back up this theory. Old animals have larger amounts of oxidized proteins, DNA and lipids than their younger counterparts.\nChemical damage[edit]\n\nThis section may be too long to read and navigate comfortably. Please consider splitting content into sub-articles, condensing it, or adding subheadings. Please discuss this issue on the article's talk page. (March 2023)\nElderly Klamath woman photographed by Edward S. Curtis in 1924\n\nSee also: DNA damage theory of aging\nOne of the earliest aging theories was the Rate of Living Hypothesis described by Raymond Pearl in 1928 (based on earlier work by Max Rubner), which states that fast basal metabolic rate corresponds to short maximum life span.\nWhile there may be some validity to the idea that for various types of specific damage detailed below that are by-products of metabolism, all other things being equal, a fast metabolism may reduce lifespan, in general this theory does not adequately explain the differences in lifespan either within, or between, species. Calorically restricted animals process as much, or more, calories per gram of body mass, as their ad libitum fed counterparts, yet exhibit substantially longer lifespans. Similarly, metabolic rate is a poor predictor of lifespan for birds, bats and other species that, it is presumed, have reduced mortality from predation, and therefore have evolved long lifespans even in the presence of very high metabolic rates. In a 2007 analysis it was shown that, when modern statistical methods for correcting for the effects of body size and phylogeny are employed, metabolic rate does not correlate with longevity in mammals or birds.\nWith respect to specific types of chemical damage caused by metabolism, it is suggested that damage to long-lived biopolymers, such as structural proteins or DNA, caused by ubiquitous chemical agents in the body such as oxygen and sugars, are in part responsible for aging. The damage can include breakage of biopolymer chains, cross-linking of biopolymers, or chemical attachment of unnatural substituents (haptens) to biopolymers.\nUnder normal aerobic conditions, approximately 4% of the oxygen metabolized by mitochondria is converted to superoxide ion, which can subsequently be converted to hydrogen peroxide, hydroxyl radical and eventually other reactive species including other peroxides and singlet oxygen, which can, in turn, generate free radicals capable of damaging structural proteins and DNA. Certain metal ions found in the body, such as copper and iron, may participate in the process. (In Wilson's disease, a hereditary defect that causes the body to retain copper, some of the symptoms resemble accelerated senescence.) These processes termed oxidative stress are linked to the potential benefits of dietary polyphenol antioxidants, for example in coffee, and tea. However their typically positive effects on lifespans when consumption is moderate have also been explained by effects on autophagy, glucose metabolism and AMPK.\nSugars such as glucose and fructose can react with certain amino acids such as lysine and arginine and certain DNA bases such as guanine to produce sugar adducts, in a process called glycation. These adducts can further rearrange to form reactive species, which can then cross-link the structural proteins or DNA to similar biopolymers or other biomolecules such as non-structural proteins. People with diabetes, who have elevated blood sugar, develop senescence-associated disorders much earlier than the general population, but can delay such disorders by rigorous control of their blood sugar levels. There is evidence that sugar damage is linked to oxidant damage in a process termed glycoxidation.\nFree radicals can damage proteins, lipids or DNA. Glycation mainly damages proteins. Damaged proteins and lipids accumulate in lysosomes as lipofuscin. Chemical damage to structural proteins can lead to loss of function; for example, damage to collagen of blood vessel walls can lead to vessel-wall stiffness and, thus, hypertension, and vessel wall thickening and reactive tissue formation (atherosclerosis); similar processes in the kidney can lead to kidney failure. Damage to enzymes reduces cellular functionality. Lipid peroxidation of the inner mitochondrial membrane reduces the electric potential and the ability to generate energy. It is probably no accident that nearly all of the so-called \"accelerated aging diseases\" are due to defective DNA repair enzymes.\nDNA damage was proposed in a 2021 review to be the underlying cause of aging because of the mechanistic link of DNA damage to nearly every aspect of the aging phenotype. DNA damage-induced epigenetic alterations, such as DNA methylation and many histone modifications, appear to be of particular importance to the aging process. Evidence for the theory that DNA damage is the fundamental cause of aging was first reviewed in 1981.\nIt is believed that the impact of alcohol on aging can be partly explained by alcohol's activation of the HPA axis, which stimulates glucocorticoid secretion, long-term exposure to which produces symptoms of aging.\nMutation accumulation[edit]\n\nMain article: Mutation accumulation theory\nNatural selection can support lethal and harmful alleles, if their effects are felt after reproduction. The geneticist J. B. S. Haldane wondered why the dominant mutation that causes Huntington's disease remained in the population, and why natural selection had not eliminated it. The onset of this neurological disease is (on average) at age 45 and is invariably fatal within 10\u201320 years. Haldane assumed that, in human prehistory, few survived until age 45. Since few were alive at older ages and their contribution to the next generation was therefore small relative to the large cohorts of younger age groups, the force of selection against such late-acting deleterious mutations was correspondingly small. Therefore, a genetic load of late-acting deleterious mutations could be substantial at mutation\u2013selection balance. This concept came to be known as the selection shadow.\nPeter Medawar formalised this observation in his mutation accumulation theory of aging. \"The force of natural selection weakens with increasing age\u2014even in a theoretically immortal population, provided only that it is exposed to real hazards of mortality. If a genetic disaster... happens late enough in individual life, its consequences may be completely unimportant\". Age-independent hazards such as predation, disease, and accidents, called 'extrinsic mortality', mean that even a population with negligible senescence will have fewer individuals alive in older age groups.\nOther damage[edit]\nA study concluded that retroviruses in the human genomes can become awakened from dormant states and contribute to aging which can be blocked by neutralizing antibodies, alleviating \"cellular senescence and tissue degeneration and, to some extent, organismal aging\".\nStem cell theories of aging[edit]\nThis section is an excerpt from Stem cell theory of aging.[edit]\nThe stem cell theory of aging postulates that the aging process is the result of the inability of various types of stem cells to continue to replenish the tissues of an organism with functional differentiated cells capable of maintaining that tissue's (or organ's) original function. Damage and error accumulation in genetic material is always a problem for systems regardless of the age. The number of stem cells in young people is very much higher than older people and thus creates a better and more efficient replacement mechanism in the young contrary to the old. In other words, aging is not a matter of the increase in damage, but a matter of failure to replace it due to a decreased number of stem cells. Stem cells decrease in number and tend to lose the ability to differentiate into progenies or lymphoid lineages and myeloid lineages.\nMaintaining the dynamic balance of stem cell pools requires several conditions. Balancing proliferation and quiescence along with homing (See niche) and self-renewal of hematopoietic stem cells are favoring elements of stem cell pool maintenance while differentiation, mobilization and senescence are detrimental elements. These detrimental effects will eventually cause apoptosis.\n\nThere are also several challenges when it comes to therapeutic use of stem cells and their ability to replenish organs and tissues. First, different cells may have different lifespans even though they originate from the same stem cells (See T-cells and erythrocytes), meaning that aging can occur differently in cells that have longer lifespans as opposed to the ones with shorter lifespans. Also, continual effort to replace the somatic cells may cause exhaustion of stem cells.\nHematopoietic stem cell aging\nHematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) regenerate the blood system throughout life and maintain homeostasis. DNA strand breaks accumulate in long term HSCs during aging. This accumulation is associated with a broad attenuation of DNA repair and response pathways that depends on HSC quiescence. DNA ligase 4 (Lig4) has a highly specific role in the repair of double-strand breaks by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ).  Lig4 deficiency in the mouse causes a progressive loss of HSCs during aging. These findings suggest that NHEJ is a key determinant of the ability of HSCs to maintain themselves over time.\nHematopoietic stem cell diversity aging\nA study showed that the clonal diversity of stem cells that produce blood cells gets drastically reduced around age 70 to a faster-growing few, substantiating a novel theory of ageing which could enable healthy aging.\nHematopoietic mosaic loss of chromosome Y\nA 2022 study showed that blood cells' loss of the Y chromosome in a subset of cells, called 'mosaic loss of chromosome Y' (mLOY) and reportedly affecting at least 40% of 70 years-old men to some degree, contributes to fibrosis, heart risks, and mortality in a causal way.\n\nBiomarkers of aging[edit]\n\nMain article: Biomarkers of aging\nIf different individuals age at different rates, then fecundity, mortality, and functional capacity might be better predicted by biomarkers than by chronological age. However, graying of hair, face aging, skin wrinkles and other common changes seen with aging are not better indicators of future functionality than chronological age. Biogerontologists have continued efforts to find and validate biomarkers of aging, but success thus far has been limited.\nLevels of CD4 and CD8 memory T cells and naive T cells have been used to give good predictions of the expected lifespan of middle-aged mice.\nAging clocks[edit]\n\nThis section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it.  (March 2023)\nThere is interest in an epigenetic clock as a biomarker of aging, based on its ability to predict human chronological age. Basic blood biochemistry and cell counts can also be used to accurately predict the chronological age. It is also possible to predict the human chronological age using the transcriptomic aging clocks.\nThere is research and development of further biomarkers, detection systems and software systems to measure biological age of different tissues or systems or overall. For example, a deep learning (DL) software using anatomic magnetic resonance images estimated brain age with relatively high accuracy, including detecting early signs of Alzheimer's disease and varying neuroanatomical patterns of neurological aging, and a DL tool was reported as to calculate a person's inflammatory age based on patterns of systemic age-related inflammation.\nAging clocks have been used to evaluate impacts of interventions on humans, including combination therapies.\n\nGenetic determinants of aging[edit]\n\nMain article: Genetics of aging\nA number of genetic components of aging have been identified using model organisms, ranging from the simple budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to worms such as Caenorhabditis elegans and fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster). Study of these organisms has revealed the presence of at least two conserved aging pathways.\nGene expression is imperfectly controlled, and it is possible that random fluctuations in the expression levels of many genes contribute to the aging process as suggested by a study of such genes in yeast. Individual cells, which are genetically identical, nonetheless can have substantially different responses to outside stimuli, and markedly different lifespans, indicating the epigenetic factors play an important role in gene expression and aging as well as genetic factors. There is research into epigenetics of aging.\nThe ability to repair DNA double-strand breaks declines with aging in mice and humans.\nA set of rare hereditary (genetics) disorders, each called progeria, has been known for some time. Sufferers exhibit symptoms resembling accelerated aging, including wrinkled skin. The cause of Hutchinson\u2013Gilford progeria syndrome was reported in the journal Nature in May 2003.\nThis report suggests that DNA damage, not oxidative stress, is the cause of this form of accelerated aging.\nA study indicates that aging may shift activity toward short genes or shorter transcript length and that this can be countered by interventions.\n\nHealthspans and aging in society[edit]\nPast and projected age of the human world population through time as of 2021\nHealthspan-lifespan gap (LHG)\nHealthspan extension relies on the unison of social, clinical and scientific programs or domains of work.\nHealthspan can broadly be defined as the period of one's life that one is healthy, such as free of significant diseases or declines of capacities (e.g. of senses, muscle, endurance and cognition).\nThese paragraphs are an excerpt from Global health \u00a7 Multimorbidity, age-related diseases and aging.[edit]\nWith aging populations, there is a rise of age-related diseases which puts major burdens on healthcare systems as well as contemporary economies or contemporary economics and their appendant societal systems. Healthspan extension and anti-aging research seek to extend the span of health in the old as well as slow aging or its negative impacts such as physical and mental decline. Modern anti-senescent and regenerative technology with augmented decision making could help \"responsibly bridge the healthspan-lifespan gap for a future of equitable global wellbeing\". Aging is \"the most prevalent risk factor for chronic disease, frailty and disability, and it is estimated that there will be over 2 billion persons age\u2009>\u200960 by the year 2050\", making it a large global health challenge that demands substantial (and well-orchestrated or efficient) efforts, including interventions that alter and target the inborn aging process.\nBiological aging or the LHG comes with a great cost burden to society, including potentially rising health care costs (also depending on types and costs of treatments). This, along with global quality of life or wellbeing, highlight the importance of extending healthspans.\nMany measures that may extend lifespans may simultaneously also extend healthspans, albeit that is not necessarily the case, indicating that \"lifespan can no longer be the sole parameter of interest\" in related research. While recent life expectancy increases were not followed by \"parallel\" healthspan expansion, awareness of the concept and issues of healthspan lags as of 2017. Scientists have noted that \"[c]hronic diseases of aging are increasing and are inflicting untold costs on human quality of life\".\n\nInterventions[edit]\nThis section is an excerpt from Life extension.[edit]\nLife extension is the concept of extending the human lifespan, either modestly through improvements in medicine or dramatically by increasing the maximum lifespan beyond its generally-settled limit of 125 years. Several researchers in the area, along with \"life extensionists\", \"immortalists\", or \"longevists\" (those who wish to achieve longer lives themselves), postulate that future breakthroughs in tissue rejuvenation, stem cells, regenerative medicine, molecular repair, gene therapy, pharmaceuticals, and organ replacement (such as with artificial organs or xenotransplantations) will eventually enable humans to have indefinite lifespans through complete rejuvenation to a healthy youthful condition (agerasia). The ethical ramifications, if life extension becomes a possibility, are debated by bioethicists.\n\nThe sale of purported anti-aging products such as supplements and hormone replacement is a lucrative global industry. For example, the industry that promotes the use of hormones as a treatment for consumers to slow or reverse the aging process in the US market generated about $50\u00a0billion of revenue a year in 2009. The use of such hormone products has not been proven to be effective or safe.\n\nSee also[edit]\nAnti-aging movement\nAntimuscarinics\nDementia\nDNA repair\nGeriatrics\nGerontology\nHeavy metals\nHomeostatic capacity\nImmortality\nIndex of topics related to life extension\nMitohormesis\nOld age\nPhenoptosis\nPlant senescence\nProgrammed cell death\nStrategies for engineered negligible senescence (SENS)\nSub-lethal damage\nTransgenerational design\nTimeline of senescence research"

    "content": "\nImmortality is the concept of eternal life. Some species possess biological immortality.\nSome scientists, futurists and philosophers have theorized about the immortality of the human body, with some suggesting that human immortality may be achievable in the first few decades of the 21st century with the help of certain technologies such as mind uploading (digital immortality). Other advocates believe that life extension is a more achievable goal in the short term, with immortality awaiting further research breakthroughs. The absence of aging would provide humans with biological immortality, but not invulnerability to death by disease or injury. Whether the process of internal immortality is delivered within the upcoming years depends chiefly on research (and in neuron research in the case of internal immortality through an immortalized cell line) in the former view and perhaps is an awaited goal in the latter case.\nFrom at least the ancient Mesopotamians, there has been a conviction that gods may be physically immortal, and that this is also a state that the gods at times offer humans. For Christianity the conviction that God may offer physical immortality with the resurrection of the flesh at the end of time, has traditionally been at the very crux of its beliefs. What form an unending human life would take, or whether an immaterial soul exists and possesses immortality, has been a major point of focus of religion, as well as the subject of speculation and debate. In religious contexts, immortality is often stated to be one of the promises of divinities to human beings who perform virtue or follow divine law.\n\nDefinitions[edit]\n\nThis section does not cite any sources. Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (November 2022) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)\nScientific[edit]\n\nMain article: Anti-aging movement\nLife extension technologies claim to be developing a path to complete rejuvenation. Cryonics holds out the hope that the dead can be revived in the future, following sufficient medical advancements. While, as shown with creatures such as hydra and Planarian worms, it is indeed possible for a creature to be biologically immortal, these are animals which are physiologically very different from humans, and it is not known if something comparable will ever be possible for humans.\nReligious[edit]\n\nSee also: Soul and Resurrection\nImmortality in religion refers usually to either the belief in physical immortality or a more spiritual afterlife. In traditions such as ancient Egyptian beliefs, Mesopotamian beliefs and ancient Greek beliefs, the immortal gods consequently were considered to have physical bodies. In Mesopotamian and Greek religion, the gods also made certain men and women physically immortal, whereas in Christianity, many believe that all true believers will be resurrected to physical immortality. Similar beliefs that physical immortality is possible are held by Rastafarians or Rebirthers.\n\nPhysical immortality[edit]\nPhysical immortality is a state of life that allows a person to avoid death and maintain conscious thought. It can mean the unending existence of a person from a physical source other than organic life, such as a computer.\nPursuit of physical immortality before the advent of modern science included alchemists, who sought to create the Philosopher\u2019s Stone, and various cultures\u2019 legends such as the Fountain of Youth or the Peaches of Immortality inspiring attempts at discovering an elixir of life.\nModern scientific trends, such as cryonics, digital immortality, breakthroughs in rejuvenation, or predictions of an impending technological singularity, to achieve genuine human physical immortality, must still overcome all causes of death to succeed.\nCauses of death[edit]\n\nMain article: Death\nThere are three main causes of death: natural aging, disease, and injury. Such issues can be resolved with the solutions provided in research to any end providing such alternate theories at present that require unification.\nAging[edit]\nAubrey de Grey, a leading researcher in the field, defines aging as \"a collection of cumulative changes to the molecular and cellular structure of an adult organism, which result in essential metabolic processes, but which also, once they progress far enough, increasingly disrupt metabolism, resulting in pathology and death.\" The current causes of aging in humans are cell loss (without replacement), DNA damage, oncogenic nuclear mutations and epimutations, cell senescence, mitochondrial mutations, lysosomal aggregates, extracellular aggregates, random extracellular cross-linking, immune system decline, and endocrine changes. Eliminating aging would require finding a solution to each of these causes, a program de Grey calls engineered negligible senescence. There is also a huge body of knowledge indicating that change is characterized by the loss of molecular fidelity.\nDisease[edit]\nDisease is theoretically surmountable by technology. In short, it is an abnormal condition affecting the body of an organism, something the body should not typically have to deal with its natural make up. Human understanding of genetics is leading to cures and treatments for a myriad of previously incurable diseases. The mechanisms by which other diseases do damage are becoming better understood. Sophisticated methods of detecting diseases early are being developed. Preventative medicine is becoming better understood. Neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson\u2019s and Alzheimer\u2019s may soon be curable with the use of stem cells. Breakthroughs in cell biology and telomere research are leading to treatments for cancer. Vaccines are being researched for AIDS and tuberculosis. Genes associated with type 1 diabetes and certain types of cancer have been discovered, allowing for new therapies to be developed. Artificial devices attached directly to the nervous system may restore sight to the blind. Drugs are being developed to treat a myriad of other diseases and ailments.\nTrauma[edit]\nPhysical trauma would remain as a threat to perpetual physical life, as an otherwise immortal person would still be subject to unforeseen accidents or catastrophes. The speed and quality of paramedic response remains a determining factor in surviving severe trauma. A body that could automatically repair itself from severe trauma, such as speculated uses for nanotechnology, would mitigate this factor. The brain cannot be risked to trauma if a continuous physical life is to be maintained. This aversion to trauma risk to the brain would naturally result in significant behavioral changes that would render physical immortality undesirable for some people.\nEnvironmental change[edit]\n\nThis section does not cite any sources. Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (November 2022) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)\nOrganisms otherwise unaffected by these causes of death would still face the problem of obtaining sustenance (whether from currently available agricultural processes or from hypothetical future technological processes) in the face of changing availability of suitable resources as environmental conditions change. After avoiding aging, disease, and trauma, death through resource limitation is still possible, such as hypoxia or starvation.\nIf there is no limitation on the degree of gradual mitigation of risk then it is possible that the cumulative probability of death over an infinite horizon is less than certainty, even when the risk of fatal trauma in any finite period is greater than zero. Mathematically, this is an aspect of achieving 'actuarial escape velocity'.\nBiological immortality[edit]\nHuman chromosomes (grey) capped by telomeres (white)\n\nMain article: Biological immortality\nBiological immortality is an absence of aging. Specifically it is the absence of a sustained increase in rate of mortality as a function of chronological age. A cell or organism that does not experience aging, or ceases to age at some point, is biologically immortal.\nBiologists have chosen the word \"immortal\" to designate cells that are not limited by the Hayflick limit, where cells no longer divide because of DNA damage or shortened telomeres. The first and still most widely used immortal cell line is HeLa, developed from cells taken from the malignant cervical tumor of Henrietta Lacks without her consent in 1951. Prior to the 1961 work of Leonard Hayflick, there was the erroneous belief fostered by Alexis Carrel that all normal somatic cells are immortal. By preventing cells from reaching senescence one can achieve biological immortality; telomeres, a \"cap\" at the end of DNA, are thought to be the cause of cell aging. Every time a cell divides the telomere becomes a bit shorter; when it is finally worn down, the cell is unable to split and dies. Telomerase is an enzyme which rebuilds the telomeres in stem cells and cancer cells, allowing them to replicate an infinite number of times. No definitive work has yet demonstrated that telomerase can be used in human somatic cells to prevent healthy tissues from aging. On the other hand, scientists hope to be able to grow organs with the help of stem cells, allowing organ transplants without the risk of rejection, another step in extending human life expectancy. These technologies are the subject of ongoing research, and are not yet realized.\nBiologically immortal species[edit]\n\nSee also: List of longest-living organisms\nLife defined as biologically immortal is still susceptible to causes of death besides aging, including disease and trauma, as defined above. Notable immortal species include:\nBacteria \u2013 Bacteria reproduce through binary fission. A parent bacterium splits itself into two identical daughter cells which eventually then split themselves in half. This process repeats, thus making the bacterium essentially immortal. A 2005 PLoS Biology paper suggests that after each division the daughter cells can be identified as the older and the younger, and the older is slightly smaller, weaker, and more likely to die than the younger.\nTurritopsis dohrnii, a jellyfish (phylum Cnidaria, class Hydrozoa, order Anthoathecata), after becoming a sexually mature adult, can transform itself back into a polyp using the cell conversion process of transdifferentiation. Turritopsis dohrnii repeats this cycle, meaning that it may have an indefinite lifespan. Its immortal adaptation has allowed it to spread from its original habitat in the Caribbean to \"all over the world\".\nHydra is a genus belonging to the phylum Cnidaria, the class Hydrozoa and the order Anthomedusae. They are simple fresh-water predatory animals possessing radial symmetry.\nEvolution of aging[edit]\n\nMain article: Evolution of aging\nAs the existence of biologically immortal species demonstrates, there is no thermodynamic necessity for senescence: a defining feature of life is that it takes in free energy from the environment and unloads its entropy as waste. Living systems can even build themselves up from seed, and routinely repair themselves. Aging is therefore presumed to be a byproduct of evolution, but why mortality should be selected for remains a subject of research and debate. Programmed cell death and the telomere \"end replication problem\" are found even in the earliest and simplest of organisms. This may be a tradeoff between selecting for cancer and selecting for aging.\nModern theories on the evolution of aging include the following:\nMutation accumulation is a theory formulated by Peter Medawar in 1952 to explain how evolution would select for aging. Essentially, aging is never selected against, as organisms have offspring before the mortal mutations surface in an individual.\nAntagonistic pleiotropy is a theory proposed as an alternative by George C. Williams, a critic of Medawar, in 1957. In antagonistic pleiotropy, genes carry effects that are both beneficial and detrimental. In essence this refers to genes that offer benefits early in life, but exact a cost later on, i.e. decline and death.\nThe disposable soma theory was proposed in 1977 by Thomas Kirkwood, which states that an individual body must allocate energy for metabolism, reproduction, and maintenance, and must compromise when there is food scarcity. Compromise in allocating energy to the repair function is what causes the body gradually to deteriorate with age, according to Kirkwood.\nImmortality of the germline[edit]\nIndividual organisms ordinarily age and die, while the germlines which connect successive generations are potentially immortal. The basis for this difference is a fundamental problem in biology.   The Russian biologist and historian Zhores A. Medvedev considered that the accuracy of genome replicative and other synthetic systems alone cannot explain the immortality of germlines. Rather Medvedev thought that known features of the biochemistry and genetics of sexual reproduction indicate the presence of unique information maintenance and restoration processes at the different stages of gametogenesis. In particular, Medvedev considered that the most important opportunities for information maintenance of germ cells are created by recombination during meiosis and DNA repair; he saw these as processes within the germ cells that were capable of restoring the integrity of DNA and chromosomes from the types of damage that cause irreversible aging in somatic cells.\nProspects for human biological immortality[edit]\nLife-extending substances[edit]\nSome scientists believe that boosting the amount or proportion of telomerase in the body, a naturally forming enzyme that helps maintain the protective caps at the ends of chromosomes, could prevent cells from dying and so may ultimately lead to extended, healthier lifespans. A team of researchers at the Spanish National Cancer Centre (Madrid) tested the hypothesis on mice. It was found that those mice which were \"genetically engineered to produce 10 times the normal levels of telomerase lived 50% longer than normal mice\".\nIn normal circumstances, without the presence of telomerase, if a cell divides repeatedly, at some point all the progeny will reach their Hayflick limit. With the presence of telomerase, each dividing cell can replace the lost bit of DNA, and any single cell can then divide unbounded. While this unbounded growth property has excited many researchers, caution is warranted in exploiting this property, as exactly this same unbounded growth is a crucial step in enabling cancerous growth. If an organism can replicate its body cells faster, then it would theoretically stop aging.\nEmbryonic stem cells express telomerase, which allows them to divide repeatedly and form the individual. In adults, telomerase is highly expressed in cells that need to divide regularly (e.g., in the immune system), whereas most somatic cells express it only at very low levels in a cell-cycle dependent manner.\nTechnological immortality, biological machines, and  \"swallowing the doctor\"[edit]\n\nMain article: Molecular machine\nTechnological immortality is the prospect for much longer life spans made possible by scientific advances in a variety of fields: nanotechnology, emergency room procedures, genetics, biological engineering, regenerative medicine, microbiology, and others. Contemporary life spans in the advanced industrial societies are already markedly longer than those of the past because of better nutrition, availability of health care, standard of living and bio-medical scientific advances. Technological immortality predicts further progress for the same reasons over the near term. An important aspect of current scientific thinking about immortality is that some combination of human cloning, cryonics or nanotechnology will play an essential role in extreme life extension. Robert Freitas, a nanorobotics theorist, suggests tiny medical nanorobots could be created to go through human bloodstreams, find dangerous things like cancer cells and bacteria, and destroy them. Freitas anticipates that gene-therapies and nanotechnology will eventually make the human body effectively self-sustainable and capable of living indefinitely in empty space, short of severe brain trauma. This supports the theory that we will be able to continually create biological or synthetic replacement parts to replace damaged or dying ones. Future advances in nanomedicine could give rise to life extension through the repair of many processes thought to be responsible for aging. K. Eric Drexler, one of the founders of nanotechnology, postulated cell repair devices, including ones operating within cells and using as yet hypothetical biological machines, in his 1986 book Engines of Creation. Raymond Kurzweil, a futurist and transhumanist, stated in his book The Singularity Is Near that he believes that advanced medical nanorobotics could completely remedy the effects of aging by 2030. According to Richard Feynman, it was his former graduate student and collaborator Albert Hibbs who originally suggested to him (circa 1959) the idea of a medical use for Feynman\u2019s theoretical micromachines (see biological machine). Hibbs suggested that certain repair machines might one day be reduced in size to the point that it would, in theory, be possible to (as Feynman put it) \"swallow the doctor\". The idea was incorporated into Feynman\u2019s 1959 essay There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom.\nCryonics[edit]\n\nThis section does not cite any sources. Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (November 2022) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)\n\nMain article: Cryonics\nCryonics, the practice of preserving organisms (either intact specimens or only their brains) for possible future revival by storing them at cryogenic temperatures where metabolism and decay are almost completely stopped, can be used to 'pause' for those who believe that life extension technologies will not develop sufficiently within their lifetime. Ideally, cryonics would allow clinically dead people to be brought back in the future after cures to the patients\u2019 diseases have been discovered and aging is reversible. Modern cryonics procedures use a process called vitrification which creates a glass-like state rather than freezing as the body is brought to low temperatures. This process reduces the risk of ice crystals damaging the cell-structure, which would be especially detrimental to cell structures in the brain, as their minute adjustment evokes the individual\u2019s mind.\nMind-to-computer uploading[edit]\n\nMain article: Mind uploading\nOne idea that has been advanced involves uploading an individual\u2019s habits and memories via direct mind-computer interface. The individual\u2019s memory may be loaded to a computer or to a new organic body. Extropian futurists like Moravec and Kurzweil have proposed that, thanks to exponentially growing computing power, it will someday be possible to upload human consciousness onto a computer system, and exist indefinitely in a virtual environment.\nThis could be accomplished via advanced cybernetics, where computer hardware would initially be installed in the brain to help sort memory or accelerate thought processes. Components would be added gradually until the person\u2019s entire brain functions were handled by artificial devices, avoiding sharp transitions that would lead to issues of identity, thus running the risk of the person to be declared dead and thus not be a legitimate owner of his or her property. After this point, the human body could be treated as an optional accessory and the program implementing the person could be transferred to any sufficiently powerful computer.\nAnother possible mechanism for mind upload is to perform a detailed scan of an individual\u2019s original, organic brain and simulate the entire structure in a computer. What level of detail such scans and simulations would need to achieve to emulate awareness, and whether the scanning process would destroy the brain, is still to be determined.\nIt is suggested that achieving immortality through this mechanism would require specific consideration to be given to the role of consciousness in the functions of the mind. An uploaded mind would only be a copy of the original mind, and not the conscious mind of the living entity associated in such a transfer. Without a simultaneous upload of consciousness, the original living entity remains mortal, thus not achieving true immortality.\nResearch on neural correlates of consciousness is yet inconclusive on this issue. Whatever the route to mind upload, persons in this state could then be considered essentially immortal, short of loss or traumatic destruction of the machines that maintained them.\nCybernetics[edit]\n\nThis section does not cite any sources.

(November 2022) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)\n\nMain article: Cyborg\nTransforming a human into a cyborg can include brain implants or extracting a human processing unit and placing it in a robotic life-support system. Even replacing biological organs with robotic ones could increase life span (e.g. pace makers) and depending on the definition, many technological upgrades to the body, like genetic modifications or the addition of nanobots would qualify an individual as a cyborg. Some people believe that such modifications would make one impervious to aging and disease and theoretically immortal unless killed or destroyed.\nDigital immortality[edit]\n\nMain article: Digital immortality\n\nReligious views[edit]\n\nMain articles: Afterlife and Soul\nAs late as 1952, the editorial staff of the Syntopicon found in their compilation of the Great Books of the Western World, that \"The philosophical issue concerning immortality cannot be separated from issues concerning the existence and nature of man\u2019s soul.\" Thus, the vast majority of speculation on immortality before the 21st century was regarding the nature of the afterlife.\nAbrahamic religion[edit]\nThe viewpoints of Christianity, Islam, and Judaism regarding the concept of immortality diverge as each faith system encapsulates unique theological interpretations and doctrines on the enduring human nature soul or spirit.\nChristianity[edit]\n\nMain articles: Eternal life (Christianity), Christian conditionalism, Christian mortalism, and Universal resurrection\nAdam and Eve condemned to mortality. Hans Holbein the Younger, Danse Macabre, 16th century\nChristian theology holds that Adam and Eve lost physical immortality for themselves and all their descendants through the Fall, although this initial \"imperishability of the bodily frame of man\" was \"a preternatural condition\".\nChristians who profess the Nicene Creed believe that every dead person (whether they believed in Christ or not) will be resurrected from the dead at the Second Coming; this belief is known as universal resurrection. Paul the Apostle, in following his past life as a Pharisee (a Jewish social movement that held to a future physical resurrection), proclaims an amalgamated view of resurrected believers where both the physical and the spiritual are rebuilt in the likeness of post-resurrection Christ, who \"will transform our lowly body to be like his glorious body\" (ESV). This thought mirrors Paul\u2019s depiction of believers having been \"buried therefore with him [that is, Christ] by baptism into death\" (ESV).\nN.T. Wright, a theologian and former Bishop of Durham, has said many people forget the physical aspect of what Jesus promised. He told Time: \"Jesus' resurrection marks the beginning of a restoration that he will complete upon his return. Part of this will be the resurrection of all the dead, who will 'awake', be embodied and participate in the renewal. Wright says John Polkinghorne, a physicist and a priest, has put it this way: 'God will download our software onto his hardware until the time he gives us new hardware to run the software again for ourselves.' That gets to two things nicely: that the period after death (the Intermediate state) is a period when we are in God\u2019s presence but not active in our own bodies, and also that the more important transformation will be when we are again embodied and administering Christ\u2019s kingdom.\" This kingdom will consist of Heaven and Earth \"joined together in a new creation\", he said.\nChristian apocrypha include immortal human figures such as Cartaphilus who were cursed with physical immortality for various transgressions against Christ during the Passion. The medieval Waldensians believed in the immortality of the soul. Leaders of sects such as John Asgill and John Wroe taught followers that physical immortality was possible.\nMany Patristic writers have connected the immortal rational soul to the image of God found in Genesis 1:26. Among them is Athanasius of Alexandria and Clement of Alexandria, who say that the immortal rational soul itself is the image of God. Even Early Christian Liturgies exhibit this connection between the immortal rational soul and the creation of humanity in the image of God.\nIslam[edit]\nIslamic dogma bears the concept of spiritual immortality within it; following the death of a certain individual, it will be arbitrated consistent with its beliefs as well as actions and will embark on the ever-lasting place where they will abate.\nThe Muslim who holds the five pillars of Islam will make an entrance into the Jannah, where they will inhabit indefinitely.\nAl-Baqarah (2:25):\n\"But give glad tidings to those who believe and work righteousness, that their portion is gardens, beneath which rivers flow. Every time they are fed with fruits therefrom, they say, 'Why, this is what we were fed with before,' for they are given things in similitude; and they have therein companions pure (and holy); and they abide therein forever.\"\nIn contrast, the kafir hold the contradictory notion that they abide in Jahannam perpetually.\nAngels in Islam are reckoned as immortals from the perspective of Islam but most people believe is that the angels will die and that the Angel of Death will die, but there is no clear text concerning this. Rather there are texts which may indicate this, and there is the well known hadeeth (narration) about the \u201dtrumpet\u201d, which is a munkar hadeeth (rejected report). alternatively, Jinn have a long lifespan between 1000 and 1500. In some Muslim Sufi mystics, Khidr is given a long life but not immortality or there is more than a little argument stated about the demise of khidr; however, it is the matter of debate, and there is a fabrication point that goes around the Khidr drank from the fountain of Life, which is thoroughly invalid. Jesus in Islam was summoned to the sky by Allah's sanction to preserve him from the cross and endow him with long life until the advent of the Dajjal. Dijjal is, additionally, given a long life. Jesus Christ dispatches the Dajjal as he stays after 40 days, one like a year, one like a month, one like a week, and the rest of his days like normal days. The Qur\u2019an repudiates rejuvenation and physical immortality, stating it is inconceivable for humans to attain genuine elixir of life.\n\u0643\u064f\u0644\u064f\u0651 \u0646\u064e\u0641\u0652\u0633\u064d \u0630\u064e\u0627\u0626\u0650\u0642\u064e\u0629\u064f \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0645\u064e\u0648\u0652\u062a\u0650\nEvery soul will taste death\n\u2014 Quran 3:185\nIt symbolize the transient nature of life and challenge the concept of immortality in the physical world.

Accordingly, the Hebrew word nephesh, although translated as \"soul\" in some older English-language Bibles, actually has a meaning closer to \"living being\". Nephesh was rendered in the Septuagint as  \u03c8\u03c5\u03c7\u03ae  (ps\u016bch\u00ea), the Greek word for 'soul'.\nThe only Hebrew word traditionally translated \"soul\" (nephesh) in English language Bibles refers to a living, breathing conscious body, rather than to an immortal soul.\nIn the New Testament, the Greek word traditionally translated \"soul\" (\u03c8\u03c5\u03c7\u03ae) has substantially the same meaning as the Hebrew, without reference to an immortal soul.\n\"Soul\" may refer either to the whole person, the self, as in \"three thousand souls\" were converted in Acts 2:41 (see Acts 3:23).\nThe Hebrew Bible speaks about Sheol (\u05e9\u05d0\u05d5\u05dc), originally a synonym of the grave \u2013 the repository of the dead or the cessation of existence, until the resurrection of the dead. This doctrine of resurrection is mentioned explicitly only in Daniel 12:1\u20134 although it may be implied in several other texts. New theories arose concerning Sheol during the intertestamental period.\nThe views about immortality in Judaism is perhaps best exemplified by the various references to this in Second Temple period. The concept of resurrection of the physical body is found in 2 Maccabees, according to which it will happen through recreation of the flesh. Resurrection of the dead is specified in detail in the extra-canonical books of Enoch, and in Apocalypse of Baruch. According to the British scholar in ancient Judaism P.R. Davies, there is \"little or no clear reference ... either to immortality or to resurrection from the dead\" in the Dead Sea scrolls texts.\nBoth Josephus and the New Testament record that the Sadducees did not believe in an afterlife,\nbut the sources vary on the beliefs of the Pharisees. The New Testament claims that the Pharisees believed in the resurrection, but does not specify whether this included the flesh or not. According to Josephus, who himself was a Pharisee, the Pharisees held that only the soul was immortal and the souls of good people will be reincarnated and \"pass into other bodies\", while \"the souls of the wicked will suffer eternal punishment.\"\nThe Book of Jubilees seems to refer to the resurrection of the soul only, or to a more general idea of an immortal soul.\nRabbinic Judaism claims that the righteous dead will be resurrected in the Messianic Age, with the coming of the messiah. They will then be granted immortality in a perfect world. The wicked dead, on the other hand, will not be resurrected at all. This is not the only Jewish belief about the afterlife. The Tanakh is not specific about the afterlife, so there are wide differences in views and explanations among believers.\nDharmic religions[edit]\nThe perspectives on immortality within Hinduism and Buddhism exhibit nuanced differences, with each spiritual tradition offering distinctive theological interpretations and doctrines concerning the eternal essence of the human soul or consciousness.\nHinduism[edit]\n\nSee also: Chiranjivi and Naraka (Hinduism)\nRepresentation of a soul undergoing punarjanma. Illustration from Hinduism Today, 2004\nHindus believe in an immortal soul which is reincarnated after death. According to Hinduism, people repeat a process of life, death, and rebirth in a cycle called samsara. If they live their life well, their karma improves and their station in the next life will be higher, and conversely lower if they live their life poorly. After many life times of perfecting its karma, the soul is freed from the cycle and lives in perpetual bliss.  There is no place of eternal torment in Hinduism, although if a soul consistently lives very evil lives, it could work its way down to the very bottom of the cycle.\nThere are explicit renderings in the Upanishads alluding to a physically immortal state brought about by purification, and sublimation of the 5 elements that make up the body. For example, in the Shvetashvatara Upanishad (Chapter 2, Verse 12), it is stated \"When earth, water, fire, air and sky arise, that is to say, when the five attributes of the elements, mentioned in the books on yoga, become manifest then the yogi\u2019s body becomes purified by the fire of yoga and he is free from illness, old age and death.\"\nAnother view of immortality is traced to the Vedic tradition by the interpretation of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi:\nThat man indeed whom these (contacts)do not disturb, who is even-minded inpleasure and pain, steadfast, he is fitfor immortality, O best of men.\nTo Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, the verse means, \"Once a man has become established in the understanding of the permanent reality of life, his mind rises above the influence of pleasure and pain. Such an unshakable man passes beyond the influence of death and in the permanent phase of life: he attains eternal life\u00a0... A man established in the understanding of the unlimited abundance of absolute existence is naturally free from existence of the relative order. This is what gives him the status of immortal life.\"\nAn Indian Tamil saint known as Vallalar claimed to have achieved immortality before disappearing forever from a locked room in 1874.\nBuddhism[edit]\n\nThis section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it.  (June 2019)\nOne of the three marks of existence in Buddhism is anatt\u0101, \"non-self\". This teaching states that the body does not have an eternal soul but is composed of five skandhas or aggregates. Additionally, another mark of existence is impermanence, also called anicca, which runs directly counter to concepts of immortality or permanence. According to one Tibetan Buddhist teaching, Dzogchen, individuals can transform the physical body into an immortal body of light called the rainbow body.\nAncient religions[edit]\nWithin the intricate tapestry of ancient religious ideologies, delve into a profound contemplation of the concept of immortality. Simultaneously, broaden the expanse of this intellectual exploration, allowing for a more comprehensive examination of the subject matter.\nAncient Greek religion[edit]\nImmortality in ancient Greek religion originally always included an eternal union of body and soul as can be seen in Homer, Hesiod, and various other ancient texts. The soul was considered to have an eternal existence in Hades, but without the body the soul was considered dead. Although almost everybody had nothing to look forward to but an eternal existence as a disembodied dead soul, a number of men and women were considered to have gained physical immortality and been brought to live forever in either Elysium, the Islands of the Blessed, heaven, the ocean or literally right under the ground.\nAmong those humans made immortal were Amphiaraus, Ganymede, Ino, Iphigenia, Menelaus, Peleus, and a great number of those who fought in the Trojan and Theban wars. Asclepius was killed by Zeus, and by Apollo's request, was subsequently immortalized as a star.\nIn ancient Greek religion a number of men and women have been interpreted as being resurrected and made immortal. Achilles, after being killed, was snatched from his funeral pyre by his divine mother Thetis and brought to an immortal existence in either Leuce, the Elysian plains or the Islands of the Blessed. Memnon, who was killed by Achilles, seems to have received a similar fate. Alcmene, Castor, Heracles, and Melicertes, are also among the figures interpreted to have been resurrected to physical immortality. According to Herodotus's Histories, the seventh century BC sage Aristeas of Proconnesus was first found dead, after which his body disappeared from a locked room. He would reappear alive years later. However, Greek attitudes towards resurrection were generally negative, and the idea of resurrection was considered neither desirable nor possible. For example, Asclepius was killed by Zeus for using herbs to resurrect the dead, but by his father Apollo's request, was subsequently immortalized as a star.\nWriting his Lives of Illustrious Men (Parallel Lives) in the first century, the Middle Platonic philosopher Plutarch in his chapter on Romulus gave an account of the king's mysterious disappearance and subsequent deification, comparing it to Greek tales such as the physical immortalization of Alcmene and Aristeas the Proconnesian, \"for they say Aristeas died in a fuller's work-shop, and his friends coming to look for him, found his body vanished; and that some presently after, coming from abroad, said they met him traveling towards Croton\". Plutarch openly scorned such beliefs held in ancient Greek religion, writing, \"many such improbabilities do your fabulous writers relate, deifying creatures naturally mortal.\" Likewise, he writes that while something within humans comes from the gods and returns to them after death, this happens \"only when it is most completely separated and set free from the body, and becomes altogether pure, fleshless, and undefiled.\"\nThe parallel between these traditional beliefs and the later resurrection of Jesus was not lost on early Christians, as Justin Martyr argued:\n\"when we say ... Jesus Christ, our teacher, was crucified and died, and rose again, and ascended into heaven, we propose nothing different from what you believe regarding those whom you consider sons of Zeus.\"\nThe philosophical idea of an immortal soul was a belief first appearing with either Pherecydes or the Orphics, and most importantly advocated by Plato and his followers. This, however, never became the general norm in Hellenistic thought. As may be witnessed even into the Christian era, not least by the complaints of various philosophers over popular beliefs, many or perhaps most traditional Greeks maintained the conviction that certain individuals were resurrected from the dead and made physically immortal and that others could only look forward to an existence as disembodied and dead, though everlasting, souls.\nZoroastrianism[edit]\nZoroastrians believe that on the fourth day after death, the human soul leaves the body and the body remains as an empty shell. Souls would go to either heaven or hell; these concepts of the afterlife in Zoroastrianism may have influenced Abrahamic religions. The Persian word for \"immortal\" is associated with the month \"Amurdad\", meaning \"deathless\" in Persian, in the Iranian calendar (near the end of July). The month of Amurdad or Ameretat is celebrated in Persian culture as ancient Persians believed the \"Angel of Immortality\" won over the \"Angel of Death\" in this month.\nNorse Mythology[edit]\nDelving into the intricate weave of ancient Norse religious beliefs, we find a captivating exploration of the concept of immortality that transcends the mortal realm. The Norse cosmos, with its diverse realms and deities, unfolds a tapestry of ideas that enrich our understanding of life beyond earthly existence.\nIn the cosmic expanse of Norse mythology, three primary realms stand as pillars of existence: Asgard, the realm of the Aesir gods; Midgard, the world of humans; and Hel, the underworld governed by the enigmatic goddess Hel. Within this cosmic framework, immortality takes on multifaceted dimensions, offering warriors and mortals diverse paths in their journey beyond life.\nAt the heart of Norse belief is the dynamic afterlife, a realm not confined to a singular destination but a vast and varied landscape. Valhalla, the majestic hall of Odin, awaits those warriors who meet their end in glorious battle. Here, the chosen Einherjar, the honored dead, revel in eternal feasting and prepare for the cataclysmic events of Ragnar\u00f6k, the end of the world. This warrior\u2019s paradise embodies a unique form of immortality, where valorous deeds echo through eternity.\nContrastingly, the realm of Hel unfolds a different aspect of the afterlife. Hel, presided over by the goddess Hel, serves as the final destination for those who did not meet a heroic end. This realm is a place of rest and reflection, marking a departure from the celebratory atmosphere of Valhalla. Hel\u2019s domain reflects the Norse acknowledgment of a more subdued form of immortality, one tied to the continuation of the soul in a distinct afterlife.\nCentral to the cosmological interplay is Yggdrasil, the cosmic tree that binds and connects these realms. Yggdrasil symbolizes the profound interconnectedness of all existence, from the divine Aesir to the mortal realm of Midgard and down to the underworld of Hel. Its branches reach into the heavens, touching Asgard, while its roots extend into the depths of Hel, embodying the cyclical nature of life, death, and rebirth.\nThis comprehensive examination of Norse cosmology unveils a rich and nuanced understanding of immortality. It is not a singular concept but a dynamic interplay of destinies, where the valiant find eternal glory in Valhalla, the departed rest in the halls of Hel, and the cosmic tree Yggdrasil weaves the threads of existence into a profound tapestry that resonates throughout the ages.\nPhilosophical religions[edit]\nWithin the realm of philosophical religious paradigms, engage in a profound exploration of the concept of immortality. Simultaneously, expand the breadth and depth of this intellectual inquiry to afford a more intricate examination of the subject matter.\nTaoism[edit]\n\nSee also: Chinese alchemy, Taoism and death, and Xian (Taoism)\nIt is repeatedly stated in the L\u00fcshi Chunqiu that death is unavoidable. Henri Maspero noted that many scholarly works frame Taoism as a school of thought focused on the quest for immortality. Isabelle Robinet asserts that Taoism is better understood as a way of life than as a religion, and that its adherents do not approach or view Taoism the way non-Taoist historians have done. In the Tractate of Actions and their Retributions, a traditional teaching, spiritual immortality can be rewarded to people who do a certain amount of good deeds and live a simple, pure life. A list of good deeds and sins are tallied to determine whether or not a mortal is worthy. Spiritual immortality in this definition allows the soul to leave the earthly realms of afterlife and go to pure realms in the Taoist cosmology.\n\nPhilosophical arguments for the immortality of the soul[edit]\nAlcmaeon of Croton[edit]\nAlcmaeon of Croton argued that the soul is continuously and ceaselessly in motion. The exact form of his argument is unclear, but it appears to have influenced Plato, Aristotle, and other later writers.\nPlato[edit]\nPlato's Phaedo advances four arguments for the soul\u2019s immortality:\nThe Cyclical Argument, or Opposites Argument explains that Forms are eternal and unchanging, and as the soul always brings life, then it must not die, and is necessarily \"imperishable\". As the body is mortal and is subject to physical death, the soul must be its indestructible opposite. Plato then suggests the analogy of fire and cold. If the form of cold is imperishable, and fire, its opposite, was within close proximity, it would have to withdraw intact as does the soul during death. This could be likened to the idea of the opposite charges of magnets.\nThe Theory of Recollection explains that we possess some non-empirical knowledge (e.g. The Form of Equality) at birth, implying the soul existed before birth to carry that knowledge. Another account of the theory is found in Plato's Meno, although in that case Socrates implies anamnesis (previous knowledge of everything) whereas he is not so bold in Phaedo.\nThe Affinity Argument, explains that invisible, immortal, and incorporeal things are different from visible, mortal, and corporeal things. Our soul is of the former, while our body is of the latter, so when our bodies die and decay, our soul will continue to live.\nThe Argument from Form of Life or The Final Argument explains that the Forms, incorporeal and static entities, are the cause of all things in the world, and all things participate in Forms. For example, beautiful things participate in the Form of Beauty; the number four participates in the Form of the Even, etc. The soul, by its very nature, participates in the Form of Life, which means the soul can never die.\nPlotinus[edit]\nPlotinus offers a version of the argument that Kant calls \"The Achilles of Rationalist Psychology\". Plotinus first argues that the soul is simple, then notes that a simple being cannot decompose. Many subsequent philosophers have argued both that the soul is simple and that it must be immortal. The tradition arguably culminates with Moses Mendelssohn's Phaedon.\nMetochites[edit]\nTheodore Metochites argues that part of the soul's nature is to move itself, but that a given movement will cease only if what causes the movement is separated from the thing moved \u2013 an impossibility if they are one and the same.\nAvicenna[edit]\nAvicenna argued for the distinctness of the soul and the body, and the incorruptibility of the former.\nAquinas[edit]\nThe full argument for the immortality of the soul and Thomas Aquinas' elaboration of Aristotelian theory is found in Question 75 of the First Part of the Summa Theologica.\nDescartes[edit]\nRen\u00e9 Descartes endorses the claim that the soul is simple, and also that this entails that it cannot decompose. Descartes does not address the possibility that the soul might suddenly disappear.\nLeibniz[edit]\nIn early work, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz endorses a version of the argument from the simplicity of the soul to its immortality, but like his predecessors, he does not address the possibility that the soul might suddenly disappear. In his monadology he advances a sophisticated novel argument for the immortality of monads.\nMoses Mendelssohn[edit]\nMoses Mendelssohn's Phaedon is a defense of the simplicity and immortality of the soul. It is a series of three dialogues, revisiting the Platonic dialogue Phaedo, in which Socrates argues for the immortality of the soul, in preparation for his own death. Many philosophers, including Plotinus, Descartes, and Leibniz, argue that the soul is simple, and that because simples cannot decompose they must be immortal. In the Phaedon, Mendelssohn addresses gaps in earlier versions of this argument (an argument that Kant calls the Achilles of Rationalist Psychology). The Phaedon contains an original argument for the simplicity of the soul, and also an original argument that simples cannot suddenly disappear. It contains further original arguments that the soul must retain its rational capacities as long as it exists.\n\nEthics[edit]\n\nSee also: Life extension \u00a7\u00a0Ethics and politics\nThe possibility of clinical immortality raises a host of medical, philosophical, and religious issues and ethical questions. These include persistent vegetative states, the nature of personality over time, technology to mimic or copy the mind or its processes, social and economic disparities created by longevity, and survival of the heat death of the universe.\nUndesirability[edit]\nPhysical immortality has also been imagined as a form of eternal torment, as in the myth of Tithonus, or in Mary Shelley's short story The Mortal Immortal, where the protagonist lives to witness everyone he cares about die around him. For additional examples in fiction, see Immortality in fiction.\nKagan (2012) argues that any form of human immortality would be undesirable. Kagan's argument takes the form of a dilemma. Either our characters remain essentially the same in an immortal afterlife, or they do not:\nIf our characters remain basically the same \u2013 that is, if we retain more or less the desires, interests, and goals that we have now \u2013 then eventually, over an infinite stretch of time, we will get bored and find eternal life unbearably tedious.\nIf, on the other hand, our characters are radically changed \u2013 e.g., by God periodically erasing our memories or giving us rat-like brains that never tire of certain simple pleasures \u2013 then such a person would be too different from our current self for us to care much what happens to them.\nEither way, Kagan argues, immortality is unattractive. The best outcome, Kagan argues, would be for humans to live as long as they desired and then to accept death gratefully as rescuing us from the unbearable tedium of immortality.\n\nSociology[edit]\nIf human beings were to achieve immortality, there would most likely be a change in the world's social structures. Sociologists argue that human beings' awareness of their own mortality shapes their behavior. With the advancements in medical technology in extending human life, there may need to be serious considerations made about future social structures. The world is already experiencing a global demographic shift of increasingly ageing populations with lower replacement rates. The social changes that are made to accommodate this new population shift may be able to offer insight on the possibility of an immortal society.\nSociology has a growing body of literature on the sociology of immortality, which details the different attempts at reaching immortality (whether actual or symbolic) and their prominence in the 21st century. These attempts include renewed attention to the dead in the West, practices of online memorialization, and biomedical attempts to increase longevity. These attempts at reaching immortality and their effects in societal structures have led some to argue that we are becoming a \"Postmortal Society\". Foreseen changes to societies derived from the pursuit of immortality would encompass societal paradigms and worldviews, as well as the institutional landscape. Similarly, different forms of reaching immortality might entail a significant reconfiguration of societies, from becoming more technologically oriented to becoming more aligned with nature.\nImmortality would increase population growth, bringing with it many consequences as for example the impact of population growth on the environment and planetary boundaries.\n\nPolitics[edit]\nAlthough some scientists state that radical life extension, delaying and stopping aging are achievable, there are no international or national programs focused on stopping aging or on radical life extension. In 2012 in Russia, and then in the United States, Israel and the Netherlands, pro-immortality political parties were launched. They aimed to provide political support to anti-aging and radical life extension research and technologies and at the same time transition to the next step, radical life extension, life without aging, and finally, immortality and aim to make possible access to such technologies to most currently living people.\nSome scholars critique the increasing support for immortality projects. Panagiotis Pentaris speculates that defeating ageing as the cause of death comes with a cost: \"heightened stratification of humans in society and a wider gap between social classes\". Others suggest that other immortality projects like transhumanist digital immortality, radical life extension and cryonics are part of the capitalist fabric of exploitation and control, which aims to extend privileged lives of the economic elite. In this sense, immortality could become a political-economic battleground for the twenty-first century between the haves and have-nots.\n\nSymbols[edit]\nThe ankh\nThere are numerous symbols representing immortality. The ankh is an Egyptian symbol of life that holds connotations of immortality when depicted in the hands of the gods and pharaohs, who were seen as having control over the journey of life. The M\u00f6bius strip in the shape of a trefoil knot is another symbol of immortality. Most symbolic representations of infinity or the life cycle are often used to represent immortality depending on the context they are placed in. Other examples include the Ouroboros, the Chinese fungus of longevity, the ten kanji, the phoenix, the peacock in Christianity, and the colors amaranth (in Western culture) and peach (in Chinese culture).\n\nSee also[edit]\nAfterlife\nAkal (Sikh term)\nAmbrosia\nAmrita\nBioethics\nBiogerontology\nBrooke Greenberg\nCrown of Immortality\nDyson's eternal intelligence\nElixir of life\nEternal return\nEternal youth\nGhost\nImmortal DNA strand hypothesis\nImmortalist Society\nImmortality in fiction\nLich\nList of people claimed to be immortal in myth and legend\nMethuselah Mouse Prize\nMolecular nanotechnology\nNegligible senescence\nTipler's Omega Point\nOrganlegging\nNeidan\nPosthuman\nResurrection\nQueen Mother of the West\nSimulated reality\nSuspended animation\nUndead\nRegeneration (theology)\n\nFootnotes[edit]\n^ \nThe basic idea is to take a particular brain, scan its structure in detail, and construct a software model of it that is so faithful to the original that, when run on appropriate hardware, it will behave in essentially the same way as the original brain.\n\u2014 Sandberg & Bostr\u00f6m (2008)\n\n^ \n\"Even as we are conscious of the broad and very common biblical usage of the term \"soul\", we must be clear that scripture does not present even a rudimentarily developed theology of the soul. The creation narrative is clear that all life originates with God. Yet the Hebrew scripture offers no specific understanding of the origin of individual souls, of when and how they become attached to specific bodies, or of their potential existence, apart from the body, after death. The reason for this is that, as we noted at the beginning, the Hebrew Bible does not present a theory of the soul developed much beyond the simple concept of a force associated with respiration, hence, a life-force.\"\n\n^ \nIn the New Testament, \"soul\" (orig.  \u03c8\u03c5\u03c7\u03ae ) retains its basic Hebrew sense of meaning. \"Soul\" refers to one\u2019s life: Herod sought Jesus' soul (Matt. 2:20); one might save a soul or take it (Mark 3:4); death occurs when God \"requires your soul\" (Luke 12:20).\n\n^ For Avicenna's views, see:\nMoussa, Dunya, & Zayed (1960);\nArberry (1964);\nMichot (1986);\nJanssen (1987);\nMarmura (2005)(complete translation).\n\nNotes[edit]\n\n^ Marshall Fredericks (2003). \"GCVM History and Mission\".

Sequencing of venom-gland transcriptomes from 10 funnel-web species uncovered 22 \u03b4-HXTXs. Evolutionary analysis revealed extreme conservation of these toxins, despite their ancient origin. We isolated the lethal \u03b4-HXTX from venom of the Sydney funnel-web spider and showed that it induces pain in mice, suggesting a role in predator deterrence. Although humans are not the target of \u03b4-HXTXs, these toxins likely evolved to deter vertebrate predators commonly encountered by these spiders, such as bandicoots, birds, and lizards. Thus, the lethal potency of \u03b4-HXTXs against humans is an unfortunate evolutionary coincidence.\nAbstract\nAustralian funnel-web spiders are infamous for causing human fatalities, which are induced by venom peptides known as \u03b4-hexatoxins (\u03b4-HXTXs). Humans and other primates did not feature in the prey or predator spectrum during evolution of these spiders, and consequently the primate lethality of \u03b4-HXTXs remains enigmatic. Funnel-web envenomations are mostly inflicted by male spiders that wander from their burrow in search of females during the mating season, which suggests a role for \u03b4-HXTXs in self-defense since male spiders rarely feed during this period. Although 35 species of Australian funnel-web spiders have been described, only nine \u03b4-HXTXs from four species have been characterized, resulting in a lack of understanding of the ecological roles and molecular evolution of \u03b4-HXTXs. Here, by profiling venom-gland transcriptomes of 10 funnel-web species, we report 22 \u03b4-HXTXs. Phylogenetic and evolutionary assessments reveal a remarkable sequence conservation of \u03b4-HXTXs despite their deep evolutionary origin within funnel-web spiders, consistent with a defensive role. We demonstrate that \u03b4-HXTX-Ar1a, the lethal toxin from the Sydney funnel-web spider Atrax robustus, induces pain in mice by inhibiting inactivation of voltage-gated sodium (NaV) channels involved in nociceptive signaling. \u03b4-HXTX-Ar1a also inhibited inactivation of cockroach NaV channels and was insecticidal to sheep blowflies. Considering their algogenic effects in mice, potent insecticidal effects, and high levels of sequence conservation, we propose that the \u03b4-HXTXs were repurposed from an initial insecticidal predatory function to a role in defending against nonhuman vertebrate predators by male spiders, with their lethal effects on humans being an unfortunate evolutionary coincidence.\nSign up for PNAS alerts.\nGet alerts for new articles, or get an alert when an article is cited.\n\nDespite their fearsome reputation, only a few species of spiders can cause death or serious harm to humans (1). An infamous exception is the Australian funnel-web spider, arguably the world\u2019s deadliest spider (2). These spiders produce extraordinarily complex venoms, with each venom containing up to several thousand peptide toxins (3, 4). Despite this chemical complexity, a single family of toxins known as the \u03b4-hexatoxins (\u03b4-HXTXs) is responsible for the human envenomation syndrome (5). There are currently 35 described species of Australian funnel-web spiders and 38 species of related non-Australian funnel-web spiders in the genus Macrothele, but to date only 12 \u03b4-HXTX sequences have been reported from six species within this broad clade. A homologous \u03b4-actinopoditoxin (\u03b4-AOTX) is present in the venom of the related Australian mouse spider Missulena bradleyi (6), which can cause serious human envenomations with symptoms resembling those from funnel-web spider bites (7).\n\u03b4-HXTXs and \u03b4-AOTX comprise 42 to 44 residues and contain four disulfide bonds, three of which are arranged in an inhibitor cystine knot (ICK) motif (8, 9). \u03b4-HXTXs slow the inactivation of vertebrate tetrodotoxin-sensitive voltage-gated sodium (NaV) channels and insect NaV channels by binding to the voltage sensor in channel domain IV (10, 11). In human bite victims, \u03b4-HXTXs cause disturbances in respiration, blood pressure, and heart rate, followed by severe hypotension. Without treatment with commercial antivenom (5), fatalities can occur by respiratory and circulatory failure within a few hours of the bite (12). Interestingly, in striking contrast to humans and other primates, some vertebrates such as dogs and cats are insensitive to funnel-web envenomation (13).\nHumans did not feature in the prey or predator spectrum during evolution of funnel-web spiders, as primates were not present 150 to 200 million y ago (MYA) when these spiders originated (14). Thus, the underlying reason for the peculiar susceptibility of humans to \u03b4-HXTXs and the ecological role of these toxins remain enigmatic. The \u03b4-HXTXs are insecticidal (15, 16), which might suggest a role in prey capture. However, in some species, these toxins are secreted in very low abundance in the venoms of female spiders and immature males, consistent with the fact that only sexually mature male spiders cause severe or lethal human envenomations (17). Moreover, it is hard to reconcile a role for these toxins in predation given that sexually mature males, in whose venom the toxins are most abundant, rarely feed during the mating season. Rather, the fact that adult males leave the safety of their burrows to search for female spiders (2), making them more susceptible to predators, suggests a role for the \u03b4-HXTXs in predator deterrence. A well-documented strategy for defensive toxins is to induce pain (18\u201320), and pain is a common symptom following funnel-web envenomation (2, 17). Consistent with the idea that the \u03b4-HXTXs serve a defensive role by inducing pain in vertebrate predators, Magi 4 from the venom of a Japanese funnel-web spider potentiates the activity of NaV1.1 and NaV1.6 (21), which are involved in pain signaling (19, 22).\nIn the current study, we identified 22 \u03b4-HXTX sequences from 10 species of Australian funnel-web spiders, and evaluated their molecular evolution, phylogenetic histories, insecticidal activity, and potency against human NaV channels involved in pain signaling. Taken together, our data provide strong evidence that the \u03b4-HXTXs were recruited by funnel-web spiders as a weapon to deter vertebrate predators, and that their lethal effects on humans is an unfortunate evolutionary coincidence.\nResults\n\u03b4-HXTX Sequences.\n\u03b4-HXTXs from seven funnel-web spider species (Hadronyche infensa, Hadronyche valida, Hadronyche venenata, Hadronyche versuta, Atrax robustus, Atrax sutherlandi, and Illawarra wisharti) were sequenced via rapid amplification of cDNA (complementary DNA) ends (RACE) (SI Appendix). In addition, we generated cDNA libraries for H. infensa, Hadronyche modesta, Hadronyche cerberea, and Hadronyche formidabilis. Our complete dataset (Dataset S1), based on our RACE and transcriptomic data plus sequences available from the literature, comprised 169 mature peptide sequences and 167 corresponding nucleotide sequences (the latter were only missing for \u03b4-HXTX-Hv1b and \u03b4-AOTX-Mb1a). Our dataset contained 132 \u03b4-HXTXs, 1 \u03b4-AOTX, and 18 homologous U-HXTXs from H. infensa, 17 related barytoxins (U-BATXs) from Trittame loki, and 1 \u03bc-HXTX from Macrothele gigas. Removal of 53 duplicate or incomplete sequences and the two peptide sequences that lacked a corresponding nucleotide sequence yielded a total of 114 nucleotide sequences for phylogenetic analysis. The data revealed 22 mature \u03b4-HXTX sequences to complement the 12 published \u03b4-HXTX sequences.\nPhylogenetic History and Molecular Evolution of \u03b4-HXTXs.\nThe identification of homologous sequences from the barychelid spider T. loki in this study reveals that these U-BATXs, \u03bc-HXTX-Mg1c, and the \u03b4-HXTXs were probably derived from a common ancestral toxin. However, there are also important differences between the U-BATXs and \u03bc-HXTX-Mg1c in comparison with all \u03b4-HXTXs from atracid and macrothelid funnel-web spiders. First, U-BATXs and \u03bc-HXTX-Mg1c have only six Cys residues that form an ICK motif, whereas the \u03b4-HXTXs usually contain eight Cys residues, with one additional disulfide bond. Second, the \u03b4-HXTXs comprise a rare triplet of Cys residues in positions 14 to 16 (based on \u03b4-HXTX-Ar1a), which is not present in \u03bc-HXTX-Mg1c or any of the U-BATXs. Moreover, in the Bayesian phylogenetic analyses, all funnel-web spider sequences clustered together and were well-separated from the T. loki sequences (Fig. 1). All of these considerations taken together highlight the divergent evolution of \u03b4-HXTXs in atracid and macrothelid funnel-web spiders following their phylogenetic separation from other mygalomorph lineages (Fig. 1).\nFig. 1.\n\nPhylogenetic reconstruction of \u03b4-HXTXs. Tree representing the phylogenetic history of \u03b4-HXTXs as estimated by maximum-likelihood inference. The thickness of branches corresponds to node supports (thick branch, bootstrap \u2265 75; thin branch, bootstrap < 75), and various species are presented in distinct colors. The cysteine pattern (black lines) and activities (red lines) are annotated (Right). Fly and mouse icons indicate insecticidal and vertebrate activity, respectively. The underscore sequence numbers refer to the unique preprotoxin nomenclature used in the ArachnoServer database (23).\nIn contrast to the massive sequence variations observed in most venom proteins, the \u03b4-HXTXs are surprisingly well-conserved (Fig. 2). The signal peptide, propeptide, and mature peptide coding regions in the \u03b4-HXTXs were characterized by extremely low omega (\u03c9) values (i.e., the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions) (Fig. 2A and Table 1), indicative of strong sequence conservation despite being recruited into the venoms of funnel-web spiders around 150 to 200 MYA (14). Consistent with the findings of the maximum-likelihood method, the Bayesian approaches identified only three positively selected sites (2.6% of sites)\u2014positions that rapidly diversify across time\u2014while many sites (15.6%) were found to be evolving under the pervasive influence of negative selection, which ensures sequence conservation across time. A few amino acid sites (n = 7) were found to be experiencing diversifying selection, albeit in an episodic fashion (i.e., in short bursts across time) (Fig. 2 B\u2013D).\nFig. 2.\n\nMolecular evolution of \u03b4-HXTXs.

Analysis of the arrangement of eight Cys residues in the \u03b4-HXTXs (Fig. 3A) indicates that Cys residues 1 to 5 are extremely well conserved in all funnel-web spiders. However, many subtypes were discovered with either missing or novel cysteines, indicating the probable evolution of novel forms and functions. For instance, while one derivation each was found with a missing cysteine at positions 6 and 7, \u03b4-HXTXs lacking Cys-8 were more common with 11 derivations in \u03b4-HXTXs from H. infensa, with one of them even possessing a novel cysteine residue (which we refer to as position 9). The precursor peptides with the eighth Cys residue missing correspond to four mature toxin sequences, and comparison with combined matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) and Orbitrap mass spectrometry (MS) data for H. infensa venom (4) reveals closely matching molecular masses for three of the monomers, one homodimer, and four heterodimers (Fig. 3B). Analysis of the codons used for Cys residues also revealed some genus-specific variations (Fig. 3C). In all funnel-web \u03b4-HXTXs, Cys-2 is encoded by TGT, whereas Cys-3 is encoded by TGC. In Atrax and Illawarra, all other Cys residues are encoded only by TGT (except for Cys-8 in Illawarra being solely encoded by TGC). In Hadronyche, Cys-1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 are dominated by TGT and Cys-4 is preferentially encoded by TGC. In contrast to all other funnel-web spider genera, in Macrothele all Cys residues (except for Cys-2) are dominantly encoded by TGC. The observed codon bias could be important for the rapid expression of toxins in the venom gland.\nFig. 3.\n\nCys derivations and codon usage in \u03b4-HXTXs.

Lines at the top represent the four disulfide bonds in the prototypical Ar1a toxin.\nNaV Channel Subtype Selectivity of \u03b4-HXTX-Ar1a.\nIn order to examine the biological role of the \u03b4-HXTXs, we used reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) to isolate \u03b4-HXTX-Ar1a (hereafter Ar1a) from the venom of A. robustus (Fig. 4). We then used a Fluorescent Imaging Plate Reader (FLIPR)-based fluorescence assay to assess the ability of Ar1a to potentiate currents from human NaV1.1 to NaV1.8 channels stably expressed in HEK293 cells. This assay was previously used to determine the pharmacological activity of the scorpion venom peptide OD1. OD1 activates several NaV channel subtypes and the potency and subtype selectivity of OD1 as determined by FLIPR was found to be comparable to data obtained using electrophysiological assays (24).\nFig. 4.\n\nIsolation and purification of Ar1a from A. robustus venom.

(B) Chromatogram from hydrophobic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) of the Ar1a-containing peak from A. The dashed line indicates the solvent gradient, with the percentage of solvent B (90% acetonitrile/0.045% trifluoroacetic acid) indicated on the right ordinate axis. (B, Inset) MALDI-MS spectrum of purified Ar1a.\nAr1a had no effect on NaV1.4, NaV1.5, NaV1.7, and NaV1.8 at concentrations up to 150 nM, whereas a concentration-dependent potentiation of veratridine-evoked responses was observed in cells expressing NaV1.1, NaV1.2, NaV1.3, and NaV1.6 (Fig. 5A). Ar1a was an equipotent potentiator of NaV1.1 (half-maximum effective concentration (EC50) of 30.2 nM), NaV1.2 (EC50 38.9 nM), NaV1.3 (EC50 38.9 nM), and NaV1.6 (EC50 91.2 nM) with comparable mean pEC50 (i.e., negative logarithm of the EC50) values of 7.52 \u00b1 0.24, 7.41 \u00b1 0.09, 7.41 \u00b1 0.15, and 7.04 \u00b1 0.08, respectively.\nFig. 5.\n\nBiological characterization of Ar1a. (A) NaV subtype selectivity of Ar1a. The effect of Ar1a on NaV1.1 to NaV1.8 heterologously expressed in HEK293 cells in combination with the human b1 subunit was assessed using a membrane potential assay. Ar1a elicited a concentration-dependent increase in membrane potential in the presence of veratridine (5 \u00b5M) in cells expressing NaV1.1 (pEC50 7.52 \u00b1 0.24), NaV1.2 (pEC50 7.41 \u00b1 0.09), NaV1.3 (pEC50 7.41 \u00b1 0.15), and NaV1.6 (pEC50 7.04 \u00b1 0.08). Data are presented as mean \u00b1 SEM (n = 3). (B) Dose\u2013response curve for paralysis of L. cuprina blowflies (shown in Inset) injected with Ar1a. Paralysis was assessed at 1 h postinjection. Error bars indicate SEM. The PD50 was determined as the mean \u00b1 SEM of three independent experiments. All paralytic effects were reversible within 24 h and no lethal effects were observed. (C) Dose-dependent inhibition of BgNaV1 fast inactivation by Ar1a. Representative sodium currents were elicited by a depolarization to \u221220 mV before (black) and after (red) addition of toxin from a holding potential of \u221290 mV. (D) Normalized conductance\u2013voltage relationships (G/Gmax; black filled circles) and steady-state inactivation relationships (I/Imax; black open circles) of BgNaV1 before (black circles) and after (red circles) Ar1a application. Channel-expressing oocytes were depolarized in 5-mV steps from a holding potential of \u221290 mV. Error bars represent SEM; n = 3 to 5.\nMammalian Nocifensive Responses.\nAdministration of Ar1a (100 nM, 20 \u00b5L) by shallow subcutaneous (intraplantar) injection into the foot pad of male C57BL/6 mice elicited mild, transient nocifensive responses consisting of flinching, lifting, licking, and shaking of the hind paw. This nocifensive behavior was characterized by relatively slow onset (5 min postinjection) to a peak at 15 min postinjection with 10.5 \u00b1 1.5 flinches per 5 min. No systemic effects, such as the muscle fasciculations, salivation, or other effects associated with the human envenomation syndrome, were observed at this dose.\nToxicity of Ar1a in Blowflies.\nInjection of Ar1a into sheep blowflies (Lucilia cuprina) caused contractile paralysis with a median paralytic dose (PD50) of 319 \u00b1 42 pmol/g at 1 h postinjection (Fig. 5B). However, even at the highest dose tested (which was limited by the amount of native \u03b4-HXTX-Ar1a available), all flies fully recovered within 24 h, indicating that the toxin\u2019s insecticidal effects in blowflies are reversible.\nEffect of Ar1a on BgNaV1.\nGiven its activity on human NaV channels, we decided to examine if the insecticidal effects of Ar1a are due to potentiation of the activity of insect NaV channels. For this purpose, we examined the effects of Ar1a on the BgNaV1 channel from the German cockroach Blattella germanica expressed in Xenopus oocytes. At 1 nM, Ar1a had no effect on BgNaV1 currents whereas 10 nM Ar1a induced a substantial persistent current (Fig. 5C). BgNaV1 fast inactivation was completely inhibited by 100 nM Ar1a. Boltzmann fits of the normalized conductance\u2013voltage relationships and steady-state inactivation relationships revealed no significant difference in V1/2 before and after addition of 1 or 10 nM Ar1a (t test, P \u2265 0.01) but 100 nM Ar1a caused substantial hyperpolarizing shifts in the V1/2 of both channel activation (from \u221237.2 \u00b1 0.6 to \u221244.9 \u00b1 0.7 mV) and steady-state inactivation (from \u221250.3 \u00b1 0.1 to \u221263.3 \u00b1 0.7 mV) (Fig. 5D).\nDiscussion\nIn the present study, we employed a multipronged approach involving venom-gland transcriptomics, molecular and phylogenetic analyses, and functional assays to determine the role of the lethal \u03b4-HXTXs in the ecology of funnel-web spiders.\nEnigmatic Evolutionary Conservation of \u03b4-HXTXs.\nMolecular evolutionary assessments revealed that the genes encoding for \u03b4-HXTXs have remained nearly unchanged despite originating in the common ancestor of atracid and macrothelid funnel-web spiders 150 to 200 MYA (14). Together with our phylogenetic analysis, this indicates that despite the single early origin of \u03b4-HXTXs in funnel-web spiders, they have diversified at a much slower evolutionary rate than many other spider toxins (25\u201329). The increased level of sequence conservation is consistent with a role for the \u03b4-HXTXs in defense. Due to their relatively limited use and consequent exclusion from the typical Red Queen mode of competitive evolution, defensive toxins are theorized to evolve slower than their predatory counterparts (30).\nOur phylogenetic analysis demonstrates that all \u03b4-HXTX sequences evolved from a common ancestral toxin scaffold, with early gene duplications and diversification present before the recently proposed split into the families Macrothelidae and Atracidae (31). Further support of a split between these families is provided by the nucleotide sequences used to encode the Cys residues, with Atracidae being dominated by TGT and Macrothelidae being dominated by TGC. Our phylogeny also provides evidence for at least two neofunctionalization events. The first event occurred during the early evolution of \u03b4-HXTXs. \u03bc-HXTX-Mg1c, the most basal of the funnel-web spider sequences included in our analysis, has an ICK motif but lacks the two Cys residues involved in the formation of the fourth disulfide bond (32). \u03bc-HXTX-Mg1c is a homolog of \u03bc-HXTX-Mg1a and \u03bc-HXTX-Mg1b, which are both known to be insecticidal but not active against vertebrates (33). On the other hand, \u03b4-HXTX-Mg1a, which is sister to the remaining \u03b4-HXTX sequences, has both vertebrate and insecticidal activities (33). These activities would be consistent with a repurposing of \u03b4-HXTXs from the purely insecticidal activity of their ancestral plesiotypic form to dual activity against both mammals and insects, which occurred around 150 to 200 MYA (14). Given the absence of primates in Australia at the time when \u03b4-HXTXs originated [humans first populated Australia 65,000 y ago (34), and Australia lacks indigenous nonhuman primates], the primate toxicity of \u03b4-HXTXs can only be regarded as coincidental. The second neofunctionalization event is apparent in the genus Hadronyche with multiple convergent losses of the last Cys residue. Such convergence points toward a strong selection pressure, possibly resulting in a change in selectivity or potency. The fact that an odd number of Cys residues is energetically unfavored led us to investigate whether these seven Cys residue derivations of \u03b4-HXTXs form dimers. Mass spectrometry analysis of H. infensa venom (4) revealed the presence of masses corresponding to monomers and homo- and heterodimers. Unfortunately, nothing is yet known about the activities of these \u03b4-HXTX derivations or the dimers that are formed, which provides an exciting area for future investigations.\nClues from the Activity of Ar1a.\n\u03b4-HXTXs were previously demonstrated to inflict potent but reversible paralysis in blowfly larvae and crickets (16). We found that Ar1a potently inhibits fast inactivation of the cockroach BgNaV channel, which is consistent with the contractile paralysis induced in blowflies and reminiscent of the effects of other toxins that target insect NaV channels (reviewed in ref. 35).\nEmploying venom components to cause pain is a common evolutionary strategy for self-defense in venomous animals (19, 30, 36\u201338). Strong support for a defensive role of \u03b4-HXTXs is therefore provided by the nocifensive response that Ar1a induced following intraplantar injections in mice. Although the lethal dose of \u03b4-HXTXs varies considerably within vertebrates (13), we presume that high local tissue concentrations of \u03b4-HXTXs resulting from a funnel-web spider bite will induce algogenic effects in a much wider range of vertebrates than half-maximum lethal dose (LD50) experiments might indicate.\nWith regard to the subtype selectivity of \u03b4-HXTXs, \u03b4-HXTX-Mg1a (Magi 4) from the Japanese funnel-web spider preferentially activated rat NaV1.1 and NaV1.3 and mouse NaV1.6 while also showing weak activity on rat NaV1.2 channels (3). For Ar1a, we observed equipotent activity across NaV1.1, NaV1.2, NaV1.3, and NaV1.6. Overall, this is consistent with a defensive role, as both NaV1.1 and NaV1.6 are known to be involved in pain signaling (19, 22, 39). The activity of Ar1a at NaV1.6 is further consistent with the observed effects of Australian funnel-web venoms in the chick biventer assay (SI Appendix, Fig. S1) (40), as NaV1.6 is the predominant isoform at the nodes of Ranvier in motor neurons. Thus, inhibition of the inactivation of this NaV channel isoform could contribute to both sensory and motor effects in envenomed individuals, making \u03b4-HXTXs a powerful weapon to deter predators.\nDifferential Expression of \u03b4-HXTXs.\nThe clinical syndrome resulting from funnel-web spider envenomation of vertebrates is driven by the \u03b4-HXTXs (5). Male A. robustus venom was reported to be at least six times more potent than the female venom (41). In addition, the venoms of six male funnel-web species were found to be more potent than females\u2019 in inducing toxic effects in the chick biventer nerve-muscle preparation (40), consistent with increased expression of \u03b4-HXTXs in male venoms. Male funnel-web spiders are more exposed to vertebrate predation once they leave the safety of their burrows to search for female mates, so increased expression of a defensive toxin would make ecological sense to allow adult males to defend against these predators. Moreover, since adult male mygalomorph spiders consume less food than females (42), the increased expression of \u03b4-HXTXs in mature male spiders is inconsistent with a role for these toxins in prey capture.\nConclusion\nIn summary, our data suggest that the \u03b4-HXTXs likely evolved from having an ancestral role in predation to a primary role in defense against ecologically important vertebrate predators, with their lethal potency against humans being an unfortunate evolutionary coincidence.\nMaterials and Methods\nAustralian funnel-web spiders were collected from various locations and states across Australia, as summarized in Table 1.

    "content": "A transmissible cancer is a cancer cell or cluster of cancer cells that can be transferred between individuals without the involvement of an infectious agent, such as an Oncovirus. The evolution of transmissible cancer has occurred naturally in other animal species, but human cancer transmission is rare. This transfer is typically between members of the same species or closely related species.\n\nGeneral mechanism[edit]\nTransmissible cancers require a specific combination of related circumstances to occur. These conditions involve both the host species and the tumors being transferred. These typically include, low genetic diversity among individuals, effective physical and environmental transport system, effective dose of infective material and ideal micro-environments.  The cancers reproduce faster in larger quantities with different means of reproduction tend to be favored for transmission if host conditions are met. Transmissible cancers follow the general pattern of cancer spread, starting with the growth of primary cancer cells at tumor sites  followed by invasion of surrounding tissue and subsequent spread throughout the organism. The main hurdles for surviving cells of a successful spread to a new host are histocompatibility barriers. The cancers have to bypass the self recognition system, survive the difference in nutrients and induce the correct response in the new hosts to begin the cycle anew.\nTransmissible cancers behave as true parasites, relying primarily on transport systems like direct contact, environmental transport and vectors, rather than hematogenous and lymphatic carriers to spread between organisms. The amount of shredded cancer cells from initial host has to be high enough to increase survival probability. Direct contact transmissions through sexual or general contact such as in DFTD and CVTD ensures a higher potential for transmission. Population factors also play an important role. A dense population of available and uninfected potential hosts is ideal for the tumors given the complexity and difficulty of the overall process, hence its virulence and potency must be adequately controlled.\n\nHumans[edit]\nIn humans, a significant fraction of Kaposi's sarcoma occurring after transplantation may be due to tumorous outgrowth of donor cells. Although Kaposi's sarcoma is caused by a virus (Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus), in these cases, it appears likely that transmission of virus-infected tumor cells\u2014rather than the free virus\u2014caused tumors in the transplant recipients.\nIn 2007, four people (three women and one man) received different organ transplants (liver, both lungs and kidneys) from a 53-year-old woman who had recently died from intracranial bleeding. Before transplantation, the organ donor was deemed to have no signs of cancer upon medical examination. The organ recipients developed metastatic breast cancer from the organs and three of them died from the cancer between 2009\u20132017.\nIn 2014, a case of parasite-to-host cancer transmission occurred in a 41-year-old man in Colombia with a compromised immune system due to HIV. The man's tumor cells were shown to have originated from the dwarf tapeworm, Hymenolepis nana. In the 1990s, an undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma was transmitted from a 32-year-old patient to his 53-year-old surgeon when the surgeon injured his hand during an operation. Within five months, a tumor had developed on the hand of the surgeon and was subsequently excised. Histologic examinations of the tumor tissues from the patient and surgeon showed that both were morphologically identical. In 1986, a 19-year-old laboratory worker mistakenly punctured her hand with a needle previously used to extract human colonic cancer cells. No injection of the substance occurred, and the worker suffered a small puncture wound with bleeding. Within 19 days, she had developed a small cancerous nodule on her hand. The tumor was removed soon after, and has since shown no sign of reoccurrence.\n\nOther animals[edit]\nContagious cancers are known to occur in dogs, Tasmanian devils, Syrian hamsters, and some marine bivalves including soft-shell clams. These cancers have a relatively stable genome as they are transmitted. Recent studies have tested whether other highly prevalent wildlife cancers, such as urogenital carcinomas in Californian sea lions, could also be contagious but so far there is no evidence for this.\nClonally transmissible cancer, caused by a clone of malignant cells rather than a virus, is an extremely rare disease modality, with few transmissible cancers being known. The evolution of transmissible cancer is unlikely, because the cell clone must be adapted to survive a physical transmission of living cells between hosts, and must be able to survive in the environment of a new host's immune system. Animals that have undergone population bottlenecks may be at greater risks of contracting transmissible cancers due to a lack of overall genetic diversity. Infectious cancers may also evolve to circumvent immune response by means of natural selection in order to spread. Because of their transmission, it was initially thought that these diseases were caused by the transfer of oncoviruses, in the manner of cervical cancer caused by human papillomavirus. However, canine transmissible venereal tumor mutes the expression of the immune response, whereas the Syrian hamster disease spreads due to lack of genetic diversity.\nCanine transmissible venereal tumor[edit]\nMain article: Canine transmissible venereal tumor\nCanine transmissible venereal tumor (CTVT) is sexually transmitted cancer which induces cancerous tumors on the genitalia of both male and female dogs, typically during mating. It was first described medically by a veterinary practitioner in London in 1810. It was experimentally transplanted between dogs in 1876 by M. A. Novinsky (1841\u20131914). A single malignant clone of CTVT cells has colonized dogs worldwide, representing the oldest known malignant cell line in continuous propagation, a fact that was uncovered in 2006. Researchers deduced that the CTVT went through 2 million mutations to reach its actual state, and inferred it started to develop in ancient dog species 11 000 years ago.\nContagious reticulum cell sarcoma[edit]\n\nMain article: Contagious reticulum cell sarcoma\nContagious reticulum cell sarcoma of the Syrian hamster can be transmitted from one Syrian hamster to another through various mechanisms. It has been seen to spread within a laboratory population, presumably through gnawing at tumours and cannibalism. It can also be spread by means of the bite of the mosquito Aedes aegypti.\nDevil facial tumour disease[edit]\n\nMain article: Devil facial tumour disease\nDevil facial tumour disease (DFTD) is a transmissible parasitic cancer in the Tasmanian devil. Since its discovery in 1996, DFTD has spread and infected 4/5 of all Tasmanian devils and threatens them with extinction. DFTD has a near 100% fatality rate, and has killed up to 90% of Tasmanian devil populations living in some reserves. A new DFTD tumor-type cancer was recently uncovered on 5 Tasmanian devils (DFT2), histologically different from DFT1, leading researchers to believe that the Tasmanian devil \"is particularly prone to the emergence of transmissible cancers\".\nBivalves[edit]\nSoft-shell clams, Mya arenaria, have been found to be vulnerable to a transmissible neoplasm of the hemolymphatic system \u2014 effectively, leukemia. The cells have infected clam beds hundreds of miles from each other, making this clonally transmissible cancer the only one that does not require contact for transmission.\nHorizontally transmitted cancers have also been discovered in three other species of marine bivalves: bay mussels (Mytilus trossulus), common cockles (Cerastoderma edule) and golden carpet shell clams (Polititapes aureus). The golden carpet shell clam cancer was found to have been transmitted from another species, the pullet carpet shell (Venerupis corrugata).\n\nSee also[edit]\nAllotransplantation\nAnne-Maree Pearse, originator of the allograft theory of transmissible cancer\nMyxosporea \u2013 SCANDAL hypothesis"

    "content": "BrainPort is a technology whereby sensory information can be sent to one's brain through an electrode array which sits atop the tongue.  It was initially developed by Paul Bach-y-Rita as an aid to people's sense of balance, particularly of stroke victims. Bach-y-Rita founded Wicab in 1998.\nIt has also been developed for use as a visual aid, demonstrating its ability to allow a blind person to see his or her surroundings in polygonal and pixel form. In this scenario, a camera picks up the image of the surrounding, the information is processed by a chip which converts it into impulses which are sent  through an electrode array, via the tongue, to the person's brain. The human brain is able to interpret these impulses as visual signals and they are then redirected to the visual cortex, allowing the person to \"see.\"  This is similar in part to how a cochlear implant works, in that it transmits electrical stimuli to a receiving device in the body.\nThe BrainPort V100 oral electronic vision aid was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on June 18, 2015.\n\n\nSee also[edit]\nSensory substitution\nNeuroplasticity"

    "id": "smallest_genome/Genome.txt",
    "content": "\nIn the fields of molecular biology and genetics, a genome is all the genetic information of an organism. It consists of nucleotide sequences of DNA (or RNA in RNA viruses). The nuclear genome includes protein-coding genes and non-coding genes, other functional regions of the genome such as regulatory sequences (see non-coding DNA), and often a substantial fraction of junk DNA with no evident function. Almost all eukaryotes have mitochondria and a small mitochondrial genome. Algae and plants also contain chloroplasts with a chloroplast genome.\nThe study of the genome is called genomics. The genomes of many organisms have been sequenced and various regions have been annotated. The Human Genome Project was started in October 1990, and then reported the sequence of the human genome in April 2003, although the initial \"finished\" sequence was missing 8% of the genome consisting mostly of repetitive sequences.\nWith advancements in technology that could handle sequencing of the many repetitive sequences found in human DNA that were not fully uncovered by the original Human Genome Project study, scientists reported the first end-to-end human genome sequence in March 2022.\n\nOrigin of the term[edit]\nLook up genome in Wiktionary, the free dictionary.\nThe term genome was created in 1920 by Hans Winkler, professor of botany at the University of Hamburg, Germany. The website Oxford Dictionaries and the Online Etymology Dictionary suggest the name is a blend of the words gene and chromosome. However, see omics for a more thorough discussion. A few related -ome words already existed, such as biome and rhizome, forming a vocabulary into which genome fits systematically.\n\nDefinition[edit]\nIt's very difficult to come up with a precise definition of \"genome.\" It usually refers to the DNA (or sometimes RNA) molecules that carry the genetic information in an organism but sometimes it is difficult to decide which molecules to include in the definition; for example, bacteria usually have one or two large DNA molecules (chromosomes) that contain all of the essential genetic material but they also contain smaller extrachromosomal plasmid molecules that carry important genetic information. The definition of 'genome' that's commonly used in the scientific literature is usually restricted to the large chromosomal DNA molecules in bacteria.\nNuclear genome[edit]\nEukaryotic genomes are even more difficult to define because almost all eukaryotic species contain nuclear chromosomes plus extra DNA molecules in the mitochondria. In addition, algae and plants have chloroplast DNA. Most textbooks make a distinction between the nuclear genome and the organelle (mitochondria and chloroplast) genomes so when they speak of, say, the human genome, they are only referring to the genetic material in the nucleus. This is the most common use of 'genome' in the scientific literature.\nPloidy[edit]\nMost eukaryotes are diploid, meaning that there are two of each chromosome in the nucleus but the 'genome' refers to only one copy of each chromosome. Some eukaryotes have distinctive sex chromosomes, such as the X and Y chromosomes of mammals, so the technical definition of the genome must include both copies of the sex chromosomes. For example, the standard reference genome of humans consists of one copy of each of the 22 autosomes plus one X chromosome and one Y chromosome.\n\nSequencing and mapping[edit]\n\nFurther information: Whole genome sequencing and Genome project\nA genome sequence is the complete list of the nucleotides (A, C, G, and T for DNA genomes) that make up all the chromosomes of an individual or a species. Within a species, the vast majority of nucleotides are identical between individuals, but sequencing multiple individuals is necessary to understand the genetic diversity.\nPart of DNA sequence \u2013 prototypification of complete genome of virus\nIn 1976, Walter Fiers at the University of Ghent (Belgium) was the first to establish the complete nucleotide sequence of a viral RNA-genome (Bacteriophage MS2). The next year, Fred Sanger completed the first DNA-genome sequence: Phage \u03a6-X174, of 5386 base pairs. The first bacterial genome to be sequenced was that of Haemophilus influenzae, completed by a team at The Institute for Genomic Research in 1995. A few months later, the first eukaryotic genome was completed, with sequences of the 16 chromosomes of budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae published as the result of a European-led effort begun in the mid-1980s. The first genome sequence for an archaeon, Methanococcus jannaschii, was completed in 1996, again by The Institute for Genomic Research.\nThe development of new technologies has made genome sequencing dramatically cheaper and easier, and the number of complete genome sequences is growing rapidly. The US National Institutes of Health maintains one of several comprehensive databases of genomic information. Among the thousands of completed genome sequencing projects include those for rice, a mouse, the plant Arabidopsis thaliana, the puffer fish, and the bacteria E. coli. In December 2013, scientists first sequenced the entire genome of a Neanderthal, an extinct species of humans. The genome was extracted from the toe bone of a 130,000-year-old Neanderthal found in a Siberian cave.\nNew sequencing technologies, such as massive parallel sequencing have also opened up the prospect of personal genome sequencing as a diagnostic tool, as pioneered by Manteia Predictive Medicine. A major step toward that goal was the completion in 2007 of the full genome of James D. Watson, one of the co-discoverers of the structure of DNA.\nWhereas a genome sequence lists the order of every DNA base in a genome, a genome map identifies the landmarks. A genome map is less detailed than a genome sequence and aids in navigating around the genome. The Human Genome Project was organized to map and to sequence the human genome. A fundamental step in the project was the release of a detailed genomic map by Jean Weissenbach and his team at the Genoscope in Paris.\nReference genome sequences and maps continue to be updated, removing errors and clarifying regions of high allelic complexity. The decreasing cost of genomic mapping has permitted genealogical sites to offer it as a service, to the extent that one may submit one's genome to crowdsourced scientific endeavours such as DNA.LAND at the New York Genome Center, an example both of the economies of scale and of citizen science.\n\nViral genomes[edit]\nViral genomes can be composed of either RNA or DNA. The genomes of RNA viruses can be either single-stranded RNA or double-stranded RNA, and may contain one or more separate RNA molecules (segments: monopartit or multipartit genome). DNA viruses can have either single-stranded or double-stranded genomes. Most DNA virus genomes are composed of a single, linear molecule of DNA, but some are made up of a circular DNA molecule.\n\nProkaryotic genomes[edit]\nProkaryotes and eukaryotes have DNA genomes. Archaea and most bacteria have a single circular chromosome, however, some bacterial species have linear or multiple chromosomes. If the DNA is replicated faster than the bacterial cells divide, multiple copies of the chromosome can be present in a single cell, and if the cells divide faster than the DNA can be replicated, multiple replication of the chromosome is initiated before the division occurs, allowing daughter cells to inherit complete genomes and already partially replicated chromosomes. Most prokaryotes have very little repetitive DNA in their genomes. However, some symbiotic bacteria (e.g. Serratia symbiotica) have reduced genomes and a high fraction of pseudogenes: only ~40% of their DNA encodes proteins.\nSome bacteria have auxiliary genetic material, also part of their genome, which is carried in plasmids. For this, the word genome should not be used as a synonym of chromosome.\n\nEukaryotic genomes[edit]\n\nSee also: Eukaryotic chromosome fine structure\nIn a typical human cell, the genome is contained in 22 pairs of autosomes, two sex chromosomes (the female and male variants shown at bottom right), as well as the mitochondrial genome (shown to scale as \"MT\" at bottom left). Further information: Karyotype\nEukaryotic genomes are composed of one or more linear DNA chromosomes. The number of chromosomes varies widely from Jack jumper ants and an asexual nemotode, which each have only one pair, to a fern species that has 720 pairs. It is surprising the amount of DNA that eukaryotic genomes contain compared to other genomes. The amount is even more than what is necessary for DNA protein-coding and noncoding genes due to the fact that eukaryotic genomes show as much as 64,000-fold variation in their sizes. However, this special characteristic is caused by the presence of repetitive DNA, and transposable elements (TEs).\nA typical human cell has two copies of each of 22 autosomes, one inherited from each parent, plus two sex chromosomes, making it diploid. Gametes, such as ova, sperm, spores, and pollen, are haploid, meaning they carry only one copy of each chromosome. In addition to the chromosomes in the nucleus, organelles such as the chloroplasts and mitochondria have their own DNA. Mitochondria are sometimes said to have their own genome often referred to as the \"mitochondrial genome\". The DNA found within the chloroplast may be referred to as the \"plastome\". Like the bacteria they originated from, mitochondria and chloroplasts have a circular chromosome.\nUnlike prokaryotes where exon-intron organization of protein coding genes exists but is rather exceptional, eukaryotes generally have these features in their genes and their genomes contain variable amounts of repetitive DNA. In mammals and plants, the majority of the genome is composed of repetitive DNA. Genes in eukaryotic genomes can be annotated using FINDER.\nDNA sequencing[edit]\nHigh-throughput technology makes sequencing to assemble new genomes accessible to everyone. Sequence polymorphisms are typically discovered by comparing resequenced isolates to a reference, whereas analyses of coverage depth and mapping topology can provide details regarding structural variations such as chromosomal translocations and segmental duplications.\nCoding sequences[edit]\nDNA sequences that carry the instructions to make proteins are referred to as coding sequences. The proportion of the genome occupied by coding sequences varies widely. A larger genome does not necessarily contain more genes, and the proportion of non-repetitive DNA decreases along with increasing genome size in complex eukaryotes.\nComposition of the human genome\nNoncoding sequences[edit]\n\nMain article: Non-coding DNA\n\nSee also: Intergenic region\nNoncoding sequences include introns, sequences for non-coding RNAs, regulatory regions, and repetitive DNA. Noncoding sequences make up 98% of the human genome. There are two categories of repetitive DNA in the genome: tandem repeats and interspersed repeats.\nTandem repeats[edit]\nShort, non-coding sequences that are repeated head-to-tail are called tandem repeats. Microsatellites consisting of 2\u20135 basepair repeats, while minisatellite repeats are 30\u201335 bp. Tandem repeats make up about 4% of the human genome and 9% of the fruit fly genome. Tandem repeats can be functional. For example, telomeres are composed of the tandem repeat TTAGGG in mammals, and they play an important role in protecting the ends of the chromosome.\nIn other cases, expansions in the number of tandem repeats in exons or introns can cause disease. For example, the human gene huntingtin (Htt) typically contains 6\u201329 tandem repeats of the nucleotides CAG (encoding a polyglutamine tract). An expansion to over 36 repeats results in Huntington's disease, a neurodegenerative disease. Twenty human disorders are known to result from similar tandem repeat expansions in various genes. The mechanism by which proteins with expanded polygulatamine tracts cause death of neurons is not fully understood. One possibility is that the proteins fail to fold properly and avoid degradation, instead accumulating in aggregates that also sequester important transcription factors, thereby altering gene expression.\nTandem repeats are usually caused by slippage during replication, unequal crossing-over and gene conversion.\nTransposable elements[edit]\nTransposable elements (TEs) are sequences of DNA with a defined structure that are able to change their location in the genome. TEs are categorized as either as a mechanism that replicates by copy-and-paste or as a mechanism that can be excised from the genome and inserted at a new location. In the human genome, there are three important classes of TEs that make up more than 45% of the human DNA; these classes are The long interspersed nuclear elements (LINEs), The interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs), and endogenous retroviruses. These elements have a big potential to modify the genetic control in a host organism.\nThe movement of TEs is a driving force of genome evolution in eukaryotes because their insertion can disrupt gene functions, homologous recombination between TEs can produce duplications, and TE can shuffle exons and regulatory sequences to new locations.\nRetrotransposons[edit]\nRetrotransposons are found mostly in eukaryotes but not found in prokaryotes. Retrotransposons form a large portion of the genomes of many eukaryotes. A retrotransposon is a transposable element that transposes through an RNA intermediate. Retrotransposons are composed of DNA, but are transcribed into RNA for transposition, then the RNA transcript is copied back to DNA formation with the help of a specific enzyme called reverse transcriptase. A retrotransposon that carries reverse transcriptase in its sequence can trigger its own transposition but retrotransposons that lack a reverse transcriptase must use reverse transcriptase synthesized by another retrotransposon. Retrotransposons can be transcribed into RNA, which are then duplicated at another site into the genome. Retrotransposons can be divided into long terminal repeats (LTRs) and non-long terminal repeats (Non-LTRs).\nLong terminal repeats (LTRs) are derived from ancient retroviral infections, so they encode proteins related to retroviral proteins including gag (structural proteins of the virus), pol (reverse transcriptase and integrase), pro (protease), and in some cases env (envelope) genes. These genes are flanked by long repeats at both 5' and 3' ends. It has been reported that LTRs consist of the largest fraction in most plant genome and might account for the huge variation in genome size.\nNon-long terminal repeats (Non-LTRs) are classified as long interspersed nuclear elements (LINEs), short interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs), and Penelope-like elements (PLEs). In Dictyostelium discoideum, there is another DIRS-like elements belong to Non-LTRs. Non-LTRs are widely spread in eukaryotic genomes.\nLong interspersed elements (LINEs) encode genes for reverse transcriptase and endonuclease, making them autonomous transposable elements. The human genome has around 500,000 LINEs, taking around 17% of the genome.\nShort interspersed elements (SINEs) are usually less than 500 base pairs and are non-autonomous, so they rely on the proteins encoded by LINEs for transposition. The Alu element is the most common SINE found in primates. It is about 350 base pairs and occupies about 11% of the human genome with around 1,500,000 copies.\nDNA transposons[edit]\nDNA transposons encode a transposase enzyme between inverted terminal repeats. When expressed, the transposase recognizes the terminal inverted repeats that flank the transposon and catalyzes its excision and reinsertion in a new site. This cut-and-paste mechanism typically reinserts transposons near their original location (within 100kb). DNA transposons are found in bacteria and make up 3% of the human genome and 12% of the genome of the roundworm C. elegans.\n\nGenome size[edit]\nLog\u2013log plot of the total number of annotated proteins in genomes submitted to GenBank as a function of genome size\nGenome size is the total number of the DNA base pairs in one copy of a haploid genome. Genome size varies widely across species. Invertebrates have small genomes, this is also correlated to a small number of transposable elements. Fish and Amphibians have intermediate-size genomes, and birds have relatively small genomes but it has been suggested that birds lost a substantial portion of their genomes during the phase of transition to flight.\u00a0 Before this loss, DNA methylation allows the adequate expansion of the genome.\nIn humans, the nuclear genome comprises approximately 3.1 billion nucleotides of DNA, divided into 24 linear molecules, the shortest 45 000 000 nucleotides in length and the longest 248 000 000 nucleotides, each contained in a different chromosome. There is no clear and consistent correlation between morphological complexity and genome size in either prokaryotes or lower eukaryotes. Genome size is largely a function of the expansion and contraction of repetitive DNA elements.\nSince genomes are very complex, one research strategy is to reduce the number of genes in a genome to the bare minimum and still have the organism in question survive. There is experimental work being done on minimal genomes for single cell organisms as well as minimal genomes for multi-cellular organisms (see developmental biology). The work is both in vivo and in silico.\nGenome size differences due to transposable elements[edit]\nComparison among genome sizes\nThere are many enormous differences in size in genomes, specially mentioned before in the multicellular eukaryotic genomes. Much of this is due to the differing abundances of transposable elements, which evolve by creating new copies of themselves in the chromosomes. Eukaryote genomes often contain many thousands of copies of these elements, most of which have acquired mutations that make them defective.\nHere is a table of some significant or representative genomes.

Both the process of copying DNA during cell division and exposure to environmental mutagens can result in mutations in somatic cells. In some cases, such mutations lead to cancer because they cause cells to divide more quickly and invade surrounding tissues. In certain lymphocytes in the human immune system, V(D)J recombination generates different genomic sequences such that each cell produces a unique antibody or T cell receptors.\nDuring meiosis, diploid cells divide twice to produce haploid germ cells. During this process, recombination results in a reshuffling of the genetic material from homologous chromosomes so each gamete has a unique genome.\nGenome-wide reprogramming[edit]\nGenome-wide reprogramming in mouse primordial germ cells involves epigenetic imprint erasure leading to totipotency. Reprogramming is facilitated by active DNA demethylation, a process that entails the DNA base excision repair pathway. This pathway is employed in the erasure of CpG methylation (5mC) in primordial germ cells. The erasure of 5mC occurs via its conversion to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) driven by high levels of the ten-eleven dioxygenase enzymes TET1 and TET2.\n\nGenome evolution[edit]\nGenomes are more than the sum of an organism's genes and have traits that may be measured and studied without reference to the details of any particular genes and their products. Researchers compare traits such as karyotype (chromosome number), genome size, gene order, codon usage bias, and GC-content to determine what mechanisms could have produced the great variety of genomes that exist today (for recent overviews, see Brown 2002; Saccone and Pesole 2003; Benfey and Protopapas 2004; Gibson and Muse 2004; Reese 2004; Gregory 2005).\nDuplications play a major role in shaping the genome. Duplication may range from extension of short tandem repeats, to duplication of a cluster of genes, and all the way to duplication of entire chromosomes or even entire genomes. Such duplications are probably fundamental to the creation of genetic novelty.\nHorizontal gene transfer is invoked to explain how there is often an extreme similarity between small portions of the genomes of two organisms that are otherwise very distantly related. Horizontal gene transfer seems to be common among many microbes. Also, eukaryotic cells seem to have experienced a transfer of some genetic material from their chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes to their nuclear chromosomes. Recent empirical data suggest an important role of viruses and sub-viral RNA-networks to represent a main driving role to generate genetic novelty and natural genome editing.\n\nIn fiction[edit]\nWorks of science fiction illustrate concerns about the availability of genome sequences.\nMichael Crichton's 1990 novel Jurassic Park and the subsequent film tell the story of a billionaire who creates a theme park of cloned dinosaurs on a remote island, with disastrous outcomes. A geneticist extracts dinosaur DNA from the blood of ancient mosquitoes and fills in the gaps with DNA from modern species to create several species of dinosaurs. A chaos theorist is asked to give his expert opinion on the safety of engineering an ecosystem with the dinosaurs, and he repeatedly warns that the outcomes of the project will be unpredictable and ultimately uncontrollable. These warnings about the perils of using genomic information are a major theme of the book.\nThe 1997 film Gattaca is set in a futurist society where genomes of children are engineered to contain the most ideal combination of their parents' traits, and metrics such as risk of heart disease and predicted life expectancy are documented for each person based on their genome. People conceived outside of the eugenics program, known as \"In-Valids\" suffer discrimination and are relegated to menial occupations. The protagonist of the film is an In-Valid who works to defy the supposed genetic odds and achieve his dream of working as a space navigator. The film warns against a future where genomic information fuels prejudice and extreme class differences between those who can and cannot afford genetically engineered children.\n\nSee also[edit]\nBacterial genome size\nCryoconservation of animal genetic resources\nGenome Browser\nGenome Compiler\nGenome topology\nGenome-wide association study\nList of sequenced animal genomes\nList of sequenced archaeal genomes\nList of sequenced bacterial genomes\nList of sequenced eukaryotic genomes\nList of sequenced fungi genomes\nList of sequenced plant genomes\nList of sequenced plastomes\nList of sequenced protist genomes\nMetagenomics\nMicrobiome\nMolecular epidemiology\nMolecular pathological epidemiology\nMolecular pathology\nNucleic acid sequence\nPan-genome\nPrecision medicine\nRegulator gene\nWhole genome sequencing"

This tool may help us understand\nmathematical disabilities.\n\nJul 13, 2023\n\n|\n\nGrace Huckins\n\nhttps://twitter.com/StanfordHAI?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\nhttps://www.facebook.com/StanfordHAI/\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UChugFTK0KyrES9terTid8vA\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/stanfordhai\nhttps://www.instagram.com/stanfordhai/?hl=en\n\nImage\n\nOver the past half-century, neuroscientists have made extraordinary strides in\nunderstanding the human brain by inserting wires into the brains of animals\nlike cats, rats, and monkeys and characterizing how their neurons fire. Though\nsuch experiments can\u2019t be done as easily in people, looking at neurons in\nanimals has nevertheless helped scientists understand the underpinnings of\nphenomena such as  optical illusions  , memory, and  drug addiction  .\n\nBut animal brains have their limitations. Some sophisticated human behaviors,\nlike mathematical reasoning, are beyond the reach of animals \u2013 and even if\nanimals can be trained to use numbers, it\u2019s unclear whether they learn about\nthem in the same way humans do, given that they don\u2019t have the same capacity\nfor language. So when  Vinod Menon  , Stanford professor of psychiatry and\nbehavioral sciences and member of  Stanford HAI  and the  Wu Tsai\nNeurosciences Institute  , and  Percy Mistry  , a research scholar in Menon\u2019s\nlab, wanted to try to understand how children learn about numbers, they didn\u2019t\nlook to biology. Instead, they decided to try to approximate the process of\nhuman number learning using a deep neural network.\n\nDeep neural networks were originally modeled after the brain, and they have\nbeen widely used to  probe the inner workings  of the visual system. So by\ntraining a brain-like network to recognize numbers, Menon and Mistry were able\nto gather evidence about number learning in humans that would have been\nimpossible to obtain otherwise. Their results,  published in  Nature\nCommunications  , suggest that an innate number sense may not be as important\nas other researchers have proposed.\n\nBecause there are limitations to neurophysiological experiments that can be\nconducted ethically in humans, this type of research could prove essential to\nunderstanding the human brain\u2019s complex capabilities, Menon says. \u201cIt\u2019s hard\nto make inroads into understanding the neural mechanisms of complex human\ncognitive processes without building models like this.\u201d\n\n##  Testing \u2018Spontaneous Number Neurons\u2019\n\nIn a  previous study  , researchers trained a deep neural network to recognize\nimages and discovered, to their surprise, that some neurons in the network\nwere sensitive to numbers \u2013 they responded especially strongly to pictures of\na particular number of objects, despite never having been trained to identify\nthe number of objects in an image. These results seemed to lend credence to\nthe idea that numerosity is, in some sense, innate: that children may have a\nsense for numbers without being explicitly taught about them, and that future\nlearning could depend on that sense.\n\nBut no one had actually tested whether those \u201cspontaneous number neurons\u201d help\nwith number learning. To do so, one would have to first take a neural network\ntrained to recognize objects, identify its number-sensitive neurons, retrain\nthat network to report the number of objects in an image, and then see whether\nthose neurons help the network learn that task \u2013 which is precisely what\nMistry, Menon, and their colleagues did.\n\nThey found that the spontaneous number neurons didn\u2019t help with learning at\nall. Most neurons that started out number-sensitive either lost that number\nsensitivity over the course of training or became sensitive to a different\nnumber. And the neurons that did stay responsive to the same numbers didn\u2019t\nseem to be doing anything particularly essential: Removing them from the\nnetwork during the learning process didn\u2019t have any effect on the network\u2019s\nfinal performance.\n\n##  Bridging AI and Human Intelligence\n\nWhile this study was entirely performed on computers, there\u2019s reason to think\nit could have something to say about how human brains work. The team\nintentionally started with an object-recognition network that had  previously\nbeen demonstrated  to resemble parts of the monkey visual system \u2013 and after\ntraining, number-sensitive neurons in the neural network behaved like number-\nsensitive neurons in the monkey brain.\n\nWithout invasive human experiments, it\u2019s impossible to make the same\ncomparisons between the network and the human brain. But the team found other\nways to attack the problem. Looking at the pool of number-sensitive neurons as\na whole, they found that the network used two different strategies for telling\ndifferent numbers apart. One strategy used a linear number line, where the\nendpoints \u2013 1 and 9 \u2013 were easy to distinguish, but numbers in the middle \u2013 4,\n5, and 6 \u2013 were harder to tell apart. The second strategy, however, was based\naround the midpoint of the number line \u2013 so 4, 5, and 6 were perceived as very\ndifferent from each other. This  same pattern  is seen in humans as they\nlearn: As they develop their number sense, children start out sensitive to low\nand high numbers, but over time they start using the midpoint of the number\nline as a reference point as well. \u201cIt was exciting to observe the emergence\nof number line representations similar to those seen in children, even though\nwe did not explicitly train the neural network to do so,\u201d Menon said.\n\nIt would be premature to conclude, however, that human children learn in\nexactly the same way that this neural network does. The model is ultimately \u201ca\nvery, very simple approximation of what the brain is doing, even with all its\ncomplexity,\u201d Mistry says. That simplicity makes the network easier to study\nand train, but it also limits how much it can tell us about human biology.\n\nNevertheless, the model does an impressive enough job of approximating the\nnumber learning process in children that Mistry and Menon have high hopes for\nits future. Menon has spent years studying dyscalculia, a disability that\naffects numerical and mathematical skills. The team\u2019s goal now is to use the\nnetwork to study potential neural mechanisms for dyscalculia, by implementing\nthose mechanisms in the network and seeing how they interfere with number\nlearning.\n\n\u201cWe can make hypotheses about different mechanisms that might be possible\ncauses and evaluate which might be relevant. We can even look at possible\ninterventions,\u201d Mistry says. \u201cWe can use this model as a sandbox.\u201d\n\nThe study, \u201c  Learning-induced reorganization of number neurons and emergence\nof numerical representations in a biologically inspired neural network  ,\u201d\npublished in Nature Communications this June. Other Stanford contributors\ninclude postdoctoral fellows Anthony Strock and Ruizhe Liu, and coterm student\nGriffin Young.\n\nStanford HAI\u2019s mission is to advance AI research, education, policy and\npractice to improve the human condition.

Oxygen is the most abundant element in Earth's crust, and after hydrogen and helium, it is the third-most abundant element in the universe. At standard temperature and pressure, two atoms of the element bind to form dioxygen, a colorless and odorless diatomic gas with the formula O2. Diatomic oxygen gas currently constitutes 20.95% of the Earth's atmosphere, though this has changed considerably over long periods of time. Oxygen makes up almost half of the Earth's crust in the form of oxides.\nAll plants, animals, and fungi need oxygen for cellular respiration, which extracts energy by the reaction of oxygen with molecules derived from food and produces carbon dioxide as a waste product. In tetrapods breathing brings oxygen into the lungs where gas exchange takes place, carbon dioxide diffuses out of the blood, and oxygen diffuses into the blood. The body's circulatory system transports the oxygen to the cells, where cellular respiration takes place.\nMany major classes of organic molecules in living organisms contain oxygen atoms, such as proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, and fats, as do the major constituent inorganic compounds of animal shells, teeth, and bone. Most of the mass of living organisms is oxygen as a component of water, the major constituent of lifeforms. Oxygen is continuously replenished in Earth's atmosphere by photosynthesis, which uses the energy of sunlight to produce oxygen from water and carbon dioxide. Oxygen is too chemically reactive to remain a free element in air without being continuously replenished by the photosynthetic action of living organisms. Another form (allotrope) of oxygen, ozone (O3), strongly absorbs ultraviolet UVB radiation and the high-altitude ozone layer helps protect the biosphere from ultraviolet radiation. However, ozone present at the surface is a byproduct of smog and thus a pollutant.\nOxygen was isolated by Michael Sendivogius before 1604, but it is commonly believed that the element was discovered independently by Carl Wilhelm Scheele, in Uppsala, in 1773 or earlier, and Joseph Priestley in Wiltshire, in 1774. Priority is often given for Priestley because his work was published first. Priestley, however, called oxygen \"dephlogisticated air\", and did not recognize it as a chemical element. The name oxygen was coined in 1777 by Antoine Lavoisier, who first recognized oxygen as a chemical element and correctly characterized the role it plays in combustion.\nCommon uses of oxygen include production of steel, plastics and textiles, brazing, welding and cutting of steels and other metals, rocket propellant, oxygen therapy, and life support systems in aircraft, submarines, spaceflight and diving.\n\nHistory of study\nEarly experiments\nOne of the first known experiments on the relationship between combustion and air was conducted by the 2nd century\u00a0BCE Greek writer on mechanics, Philo of Byzantium. In his work Pneumatica, Philo observed that inverting a vessel over a burning candle and surrounding the vessel's neck with water resulted in some water rising into the neck. Philo incorrectly surmised that parts of the air in the vessel were converted into the classical element fire and thus were able to escape through pores in the glass. Many centuries later Leonardo da Vinci built on Philo's work by observing that a portion of air is consumed during combustion and respiration.\nIn the late 17th\u00a0century, Robert Boyle proved that air is necessary for combustion. English chemist John Mayow (1641\u20131679) refined this work by showing that fire requires only a part of air that he called spiritus nitroaereus. In one experiment, he found that placing either a mouse or a lit candle in a closed container over water caused the water to rise and replace one-fourteenth of the air's volume before extinguishing the subjects. From this, he surmised that nitroaereus is consumed in both respiration and combustion.\nMayow observed that antimony increased in weight when heated, and inferred that the nitroaereus must have combined with it. He also thought that the lungs separate nitroaereus from air and pass it into the blood and that animal heat and muscle movement result from the reaction of nitroaereus with certain substances in the body. Accounts of these and other experiments and ideas were published in 1668 in his work Tractatus duo in the tract \"De respiratione\".\nPhlogiston theory\n\nMain article: Phlogiston theory\nRobert Hooke, Ole Borch, Mikhail Lomonosov, and Pierre Bayen all produced oxygen in experiments in the 17th and the 18th century but none of them recognized it as a chemical element. This may have been in part due to the prevalence of the philosophy of combustion and corrosion called the phlogiston theory, which was then the favored explanation of those processes.\nEstablished in 1667 by the German alchemist J. J. Becher, and modified by the chemist Georg Ernst Stahl by 1731, phlogiston theory stated that all combustible materials were made of two parts. One part, called phlogiston, was given off when the substance containing it was burned, while the dephlogisticated part was thought to be its true form, or calx.\nHighly combustible materials that leave little residue, such as wood or coal, were thought to be made mostly of phlogiston; non-combustible substances that corrode, such as iron, contained very little. Air did not play a role in phlogiston theory, nor were any initial quantitative experiments conducted to test the idea; instead, it was based on observations of what happens when something burns, that most common objects appear to become lighter and seem to lose something in the process.\nDiscovery\nJoseph Priestley is usually given priority in the discovery.\nPolish alchemist, philosopher, and physician Michael Sendivogius (Micha\u0142 S\u0119dziw\u00f3j) in his work De Lapide Philosophorum Tractatus duodecim e naturae fonte et manuali experientia depromti [\"Twelve Treatises on the Philosopher's Stone drawn from the source of nature and manual experience\"] (1604) described a substance contained in air, referring to it as 'cibus vitae' (food of life,) and according to Polish historian Roman Bugaj, this substance is identical with oxygen. Sendivogius, during his experiments performed between 1598 and 1604, properly recognized that the substance is equivalent to the gaseous byproduct released by the thermal decomposition of potassium nitrate. In Bugaj's view, the isolation of oxygen and the proper association of the substance to that part of air which is required for life, provides sufficient evidence for the discovery of oxygen by Sendivogius. This discovery of Sendivogius was however frequently denied by the generations of scientists and chemists which succeeded him.\nIt is also commonly claimed that oxygen was first discovered by Swedish pharmacist Carl Wilhelm Scheele. He had produced oxygen gas by heating mercuric oxide (HgO) and various nitrates in 1771\u201372. Scheele called the gas \"fire air\" because it was then the only known agent to support combustion. He wrote an account of this discovery in a manuscript titled Treatise on Air and Fire, which he sent to his publisher in 1775. That document was published in 1777.\nIn the meantime, on August 1, 1774, an experiment conducted by the British clergyman Joseph Priestley focused sunlight on mercuric oxide contained in a glass tube, which liberated a gas he named \"dephlogisticated air\". He noted that candles burned brighter in the gas and that a mouse was more active and lived longer while breathing it. After breathing the gas himself, Priestley wrote: \"The feeling of it to my lungs was not sensibly different from that of common air, but I fancied that my breast felt peculiarly light and easy for some time afterwards.\" Priestley published his findings in 1775 in a paper titled \"An Account of Further Discoveries in Air\", which was included in the second volume of his book titled Experiments and Observations on Different Kinds of Air. Because he published his findings first, Priestley is usually given priority in the discovery.\nThe French chemist Antoine Laurent Lavoisier later claimed to have discovered the new substance independently. Priestley visited Lavoisier in October 1774 and told him about his experiment and how he liberated the new gas. Scheele had also dispatched a letter to Lavoisier on September 30, 1774, which described his discovery of the previously unknown substance, but Lavoisier never acknowledged receiving it. (A copy of the letter was found in Scheele's belongings after his death.)\nLavoisier's contribution\nAntoine Lavoisier discredited the phlogiston theory.\nLavoisier conducted the first adequate quantitative experiments on oxidation and gave the first correct explanation of how combustion works. He used these and similar experiments, all started in 1774, to discredit the phlogiston theory and to prove that the substance discovered by Priestley and Scheele was a chemical element.\nIn one experiment, Lavoisier observed that there was no overall increase in weight when tin and air were heated in a closed container. He noted that air rushed in when he opened the container, which indicated that part of the trapped air had been consumed. He also noted that the tin had increased in weight and that increase was the same as the weight of the air that rushed back in. This and other experiments on combustion were documented in his book Sur la combustion en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, which was published in 1777. In that work, he proved that air is a mixture of two gases; 'vital air', which is essential to combustion and respiration, and azote (Gk. \u1f04\u03b6\u03c9\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \"lifeless\"), which did not support either. Azote later became nitrogen in English, although it has kept the earlier name in French and several other European languages.\nEtymology\nLavoisier renamed 'vital air' to oxyg\u00e8ne in 1777 from the Greek roots \u1f40\u03be\u03cd\u03c2 (oxys) (acid, literally \"sharp\", from the taste of acids) and -\u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03ae\u03c2 (-gen\u0113s) (producer, literally begetter), because he mistakenly believed that oxygen was a constituent of all acids. Chemists (such as Sir Humphry Davy in 1812) eventually determined that Lavoisier was wrong in this regard, but by then the name was too well established.\nOxygen entered the English language despite opposition by English scientists and the fact that the Englishman Priestley had first isolated the gas and written about it. This is partly due to a poem praising the gas titled \"Oxygen\" in the popular book The Botanic Garden (1791) by Erasmus Darwin, grandfather of Charles Darwin.\n\nLater history\nRobert H. Goddard and a liquid oxygen-gasoline rocket\nJohn Dalton's original atomic hypothesis presumed that all elements were monatomic and that the atoms in compounds would normally have the simplest atomic ratios with respect to one another. For example, Dalton assumed that water's formula was HO, leading to the conclusion that the atomic mass of oxygen was 8 times that of hydrogen, instead of the modern value of about 16. In 1805, Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac and Alexander von Humboldt showed that water is formed of two volumes of hydrogen and one volume of oxygen; and by 1811 Amedeo Avogadro had arrived at the correct interpretation of water's composition, based on what is now called Avogadro's law and the diatomic elemental molecules in those gases.\nThe first commercial method of producing oxygen was chemical, the so-called Brin process involving a reversible reaction of barium oxide. It was invented in 1852 and commercialized in 1884, but was displaced by newer methods in early 20th century.\nBy the late 19th century scientists realized that air could be liquefied and its components isolated by compressing and cooling it. Using a cascade method, Swiss chemist and physicist Raoul Pierre Pictet evaporated liquid sulfur dioxide in order to liquefy carbon dioxide, which in turn was evaporated to cool oxygen gas enough to liquefy it. He sent a telegram on December 22, 1877, to the French Academy of Sciences in Paris announcing his discovery of liquid oxygen. Just two days later, French physicist Louis Paul Cailletet announced his own method of liquefying molecular oxygen. Only a few drops of the liquid were produced in each case and no meaningful analysis could be conducted. Oxygen was liquefied in a stable state for the first time on March 29, 1883, by Polish scientists from Jagiellonian University, Zygmunt Wr\u00f3blewski and Karol Olszewski.\nAn experiment setup for preparation of oxygen in academic laboratories\nIn 1891 Scottish chemist James Dewar was able to produce enough liquid oxygen for study. The first commercially viable process for producing liquid oxygen was independently developed in 1895 by German engineer Carl von Linde and British engineer William Hampson. Both men lowered the temperature of air until it liquefied and then distilled the component gases by boiling them off one at a time and capturing them separately. Later, in 1901, oxyacetylene welding was demonstrated for the first time by burning a mixture of acetylene and compressed O2. This method of welding and cutting metal later became common.\nIn 1923, the American scientist Robert H. Goddard became the first person to develop a rocket engine that burned liquid fuel; the engine used gasoline for fuel and liquid oxygen as the oxidizer. Goddard successfully flew a small liquid-fueled rocket 56\u00a0m at 97\u00a0km/h on March 16, 1926, in Auburn, Massachusetts, US.\nIn academic laboratories, oxygen can be prepared by heating together potassium chlorate mixed with a small proportion of manganese dioxide.\nOxygen levels in the atmosphere are trending slightly downward globally, possibly because of fossil-fuel burning.\n\n\nCharacteristics\nProperties and molecular structure\nOrbital diagram, after Barrett (2002), showing the participating atomic orbitals from each oxygen atom, the molecular orbitals that result from their overlap, and the aufbau filling of the orbitals with the 12 electrons, 6 from each O atom, beginning from the lowest-energy orbitals, and resulting in covalent double-bond character from filled orbitals (and cancellation of the contributions of the pairs of \u03c3 and \u03c3 and \u03c0 and \u03c0 orbital pairs).\nAt standard temperature and pressure, oxygen is a colorless, odorless, and tasteless gas with the molecular formula O2, referred to as dioxygen.\nAs dioxygen, two oxygen atoms are chemically bound to each other. The bond can be variously described based on level of theory, but is reasonably and simply described as a covalent double bond that results from the filling of molecular orbitals formed from the atomic orbitals of the individual oxygen atoms, the filling of which results in a bond order of two. More specifically, the double bond is the result of sequential, low-to-high energy, or Aufbau, filling of orbitals, and the resulting cancellation of contributions from the 2s electrons, after sequential filling of the low \u03c3 and \u03c3 orbitals; \u03c3 overlap of the two atomic 2p orbitals that lie along the O\u2013O molecular axis and \u03c0 overlap of two pairs of atomic 2p orbitals perpendicular to the O\u2013O molecular axis, and then cancellation of contributions from the remaining two 2p electrons after their partial filling of the \u03c0 orbitals.\nThis combination of cancellations and \u03c3 and \u03c0 overlaps results in dioxygen's double-bond character and reactivity, and a triplet electronic ground state. An electron configuration with two unpaired electrons, as is found in dioxygen orbitals (see the filled \u03c0* orbitals in the diagram) that are of equal energy\u2014i.e., degenerate\u2014is a configuration termed a spin triplet state. Hence, the ground state of the O2 molecule is referred to as triplet oxygen. The highest-energy, partially filled orbitals are antibonding, and so their filling weakens the bond order from three to two. Because of its unpaired electrons, triplet oxygen reacts only slowly with most organic molecules, which have paired electron spins; this prevents spontaneous combustion.\nLiquid oxygen, temporarily suspended in a magnet owing to its paramagnetism\nIn the triplet form, O2 molecules are paramagnetic. That is, they impart magnetic character to oxygen when it is in the presence of a magnetic field, because of the spin magnetic moments of the unpaired electrons in the molecule, and the negative exchange energy between neighboring O2 molecules. Liquid oxygen is so magnetic that, in laboratory demonstrations, a bridge of liquid oxygen may be supported against its own weight between the poles of a powerful magnet.\nSinglet oxygen is a name given to several higher-energy species of molecular O2 in which all the electron spins are paired. It is much more reactive with common organic molecules than is normal (triplet) molecular oxygen. In nature, singlet oxygen is commonly formed from water during photosynthesis, using the energy of sunlight. It is also produced in the troposphere by the photolysis of ozone by light of short wavelength and by the immune system as a source of active oxygen. Carotenoids in photosynthetic organisms (and possibly animals) play a major role in absorbing energy from singlet oxygen and converting it to the unexcited ground state before it can cause harm to tissues.\nAllotropes\n\nMain article: Allotropes of oxygen\nSpace-filling model representation of dioxygen (O2) molecule\nThe common allotrope of elemental oxygen on Earth is called dioxygen, O2, the major part of the Earth's atmospheric oxygen (see Occurrence). O2 has a bond length of 121\u00a0pm and a bond energy of 498\u00a0kJ/mol. O2 is used by complex forms of life, such as animals, in cellular respiration. Other aspects of O2 are covered in the remainder of this article.\nTrioxygen (O3) is usually known as ozone and is a very reactive allotrope of oxygen that is damaging to lung tissue. Ozone is produced in the upper atmosphere when O2 combines with atomic oxygen made by the splitting of O2 by ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Since ozone absorbs strongly in the UV region of the spectrum, the ozone layer of the upper atmosphere functions as a protective radiation shield for the planet. Near the Earth's surface, it is a pollutant formed as a by-product of automobile exhaust. At low earth orbit altitudes, sufficient atomic oxygen is present to cause corrosion of spacecraft.\nThe metastable molecule tetraoxygen (O4) was discovered in 2001, and was assumed to exist in one of the six phases of solid oxygen. It was proven in 2006 that this phase, created by pressurizing O2 to 20\u00a0GPa, is in fact a rhombohedral O8 cluster. This cluster has the potential to be a much more powerful oxidizer than either O2 or O3 and may therefore be used in rocket fuel. A metallic phase was discovered in 1990 when solid oxygen is subjected to a pressure of above 96 GPa and it was shown in 1998 that at very low temperatures, this phase becomes superconducting.\nPhysical properties\nLiquid oxygen boiling (O2)\n\nSee also: Liquid oxygen and solid oxygen\nOxygen dissolves more readily in water than nitrogen, and in freshwater more readily than in seawater. Water in equilibrium with air contains approximately 1 molecule of dissolved O2 for every 2 molecules of N2 (1:2), compared with an atmospheric ratio of approximately 1:4. The solubility of oxygen in water is temperature-dependent, and about twice as much (14.6\u00a0mg/L) dissolves at 0\u00a0\u00b0C than at 20\u00a0\u00b0C (7.6\u00a0mg/L). At 25\u00a0\u00b0C and 1 standard atmosphere (101.3\u00a0kPa) of air, freshwater can dissolve about 6.04\u00a0milliliters\u00a0(mL) of oxygen per liter, and seawater contains about 4.95\u00a0mL per liter. At 5\u00a0\u00b0C the solubility increases to 9.0\u00a0mL (50% more than at 25\u00a0\u00b0C) per liter for freshwater and 7.2\u00a0mL (45% more) per liter for sea water.\nOxygen gas dissolved in water at sea-level(milliliters per liter)\n\n\n\n\n5\u00a0\u00b0C\n\n25\u00a0\u00b0C\n\n\nFreshwater\n\n9.00\n\n6.04\n\n\nSeawater\n\n7.20\n\n4.95\nOxygen condenses at 90.20\u00a0K (\u2212182.95\u00a0\u00b0C, \u2212297.31\u00a0\u00b0F) and freezes at 54.36\u00a0K (\u2212218.79\u00a0\u00b0C, \u2212361.82\u00a0\u00b0F). Both liquid and solid O2 are clear substances with a light sky-blue color caused by absorption in the red (in contrast with the blue color of the sky, which is due to Rayleigh scattering of blue light). High-purity liquid O2 is usually obtained by the fractional distillation of liquefied air. Liquid oxygen may also be condensed from air using liquid nitrogen as a coolant.\nLiquid oxygen is a highly reactive substance and must be segregated from combustible materials.\nThe spectroscopy of molecular oxygen is associated with the atmospheric processes of aurora and airglow. The absorption in the Herzberg continuum and Schumann\u2013Runge bands in the ultraviolet produces atomic oxygen that is important in the chemistry of the middle atmosphere. Excited-state singlet molecular oxygen is responsible for red chemiluminescence in solution.\nTable of thermal and physical properties of oxygen (O2) at atmospheric pressure:\nTemperature (K)\n\nDensity (kg/m^3)\n\nSpecific heat (kJ/kg \u00b0C)\n\nDynamic viscosity (kg/m s)\n\nKinematic viscosity (m^2/s)\n\nThermal conductivity (W/m \u00b0C)\n\nThermal diffusivity (m^2/s)\n\nPrandtl Number\n\n\n100\n\n3.945\n\n0.962\n\n7.64E-06\n\n1.94E-06\n\n0.00925\n\n2.44E-06\n\n0.796\n\n\n150\n\n2.585\n\n0.921\n\n1.15E-05\n\n4.44E-06\n\n0.0138\n\n5.80E-06\n\n0.766\n\n\n200\n\n1.93\n\n0.915\n\n1.48E-05\n\n7.64E-06\n\n0.0183\n\n1.04E-05\n\n0.737\n\n\n250\n\n1.542\n\n0.915\n\n1.79E-05\n\n1.16E-05\n\n0.0226\n\n1.60E-05\n\n0.723\n\n\n300\n\n1.284\n\n0.92\n\n2.07E-05\n\n1.61E-05\n\n0.0268\n\n2.27E-05\n\n0.711\n\n\n350\n\n1.1\n\n0.929\n\n2.34E-05\n\n2.12E-05\n\n0.0296\n\n2.90E-05\n\n0.733\n\n\n400\n\n0.962\n\n1.0408\n\n2.58E-05\n\n2.68E-05\n\n0.033\n\n3.64E-05\n\n0.737\n\n\n450\n\n0.8554\n\n0.956\n\n2.81E-05\n\n3.29E-05\n\n0.0363\n\n4.44E-05\n\n0.741\n\n\n500\n\n0.7698\n\n0.972\n\n3.03E-05\n\n3.94E-05\n\n0.0412\n\n5.51E-05\n\n0.716\n\n\n550\n\n0.6998\n\n0.988\n\n3.24E-05\n\n4.63E-05\n\n0.0441\n\n6.38E-05\n\n0.726\n\n\n600\n\n0.6414\n\n1.003\n\n3.44E-05\n\n5.36E-05\n\n0.0473\n\n7.35E-05\n\n0.729\n\n\n700\n\n0.5498\n\n1.031\n\n3.81E-05\n\n6.93E-05\n\n0.0528\n\n9.31E-05\n\n0.744\n\n\n800\n\n0.481\n\n1.054\n\n4.15E-05\n\n8.63E-05\n\n0.0589\n\n1.16E-04\n\n0.743\n\n\n900\n\n0.4275\n\n1.074\n\n4.47E-05\n\n1.05E-04\n\n0.0649\n\n1.41E-04\n\n0.74\n\n\n1000\n\n0.3848\n\n1.09\n\n4.77E-05\n\n1.24E-04\n\n0.071\n\n1.69E-04\n\n0.733\n\n\n1100\n\n0.3498\n\n1.103\n\n5.06E-05\n\n1.45E-04\n\n0.0758\n\n1.96E-04\n\n0.736\n\n\n1200\n\n0.3206\n\n1.0408\n\n5.33E-05\n\n1.661E-04\n\n0.0819\n\n2.29E-04\n\n0.725\n\n\n1300\n\n0.296\n\n1.125\n\n5.88E-05\n\n1.99E-04\n\n0.0871\n\n2.62E-04\n\n0.721\nIsotopes and stellar origin\n\nMain article: Isotopes of oxygen\nLate in a massive star's life, O concentrates in the O-shell, O in the H-shell and O in the He-shell.\nNaturally occurring oxygen is composed of three stable isotopes, O, O, and O, with O being the most abundant (99.762% natural abundance).\nMost O is synthesized at the end of the helium fusion process in massive stars but some is made in the neon burning process. O is primarily made by the burning of hydrogen into helium during the CNO cycle, making it a common isotope in the hydrogen burning zones of stars. Most O is produced when N (made abundant from CNO burning) captures a He nucleus, making O common in the helium-rich zones of evolved, massive stars.\nFifteen radioisotopes have been characterized, ranging from O to O. The most stable are O with a half-life of 122.24\u00a0seconds and O with a half-life of 70.606\u00a0seconds. All of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives that are less than 27\u00a0seconds and the majority of these have half-lives that are less than 83\u00a0milliseconds. The most common decay mode of the isotopes lighter than O is \u03b2 decay to yield nitrogen, and the most common mode for the isotopes heavier than O is beta decay to yield fluorine.\nOccurrence\n\nSee also: Silicate minerals, Category:Oxide minerals, Stellar population, Cosmochemistry, and Astrochemistry\nTen most common elements in the Milky Way Galaxy estimated spectroscopically\n\n\nZ\nElement\nMass fraction in parts per million\n\n\n1\nHydrogen\n739,000\n71 \u00d7 mass of oxygen (red bar)\n\n\n2\nHelium\n240,000\n23 \u00d7 mass of oxygen (red bar)\n\n\n8\nOxygen\n10,400\n\n10400\u00a0\n\n\n6\nCarbon\n4,600\n\n4600\u00a0\n\n\n10\nNeon\n1,340\n\n1340\u00a0\n\n\n26\nIron\n1,090\n\n1090\u00a0\n\n\n7\nNitrogen\n960\n\n960\u00a0\n\n\n14\nSilicon\n650\n\n650\u00a0\n\n\n12\nMagnesium\n580\n\n580\u00a0\n\n\n16\nSulfur\n440\n\n440\nOxygen is the most abundant chemical element by mass in the Earth's biosphere, air, sea and land. Oxygen is the third most abundant chemical element in the universe, after hydrogen and helium. About 0.9% of the Sun's mass is oxygen. Oxygen constitutes 49.2% of the Earth's crust by mass as part of oxide compounds such as silicon dioxide and is the most abundant element by mass in the Earth's crust. It is also the major component of the world's oceans (88.8% by mass). Oxygen gas is the second most common component of the Earth's atmosphere, taking up 20.8% of its volume and 23.1% of its mass (some 10 tonnes). Earth is unusual among the planets of the Solar System in having such a high concentration of oxygen gas in its atmosphere: Mars (with 0.1% O2 by volume) and Venus have much less. The O2 surrounding those planets is produced solely by the action of ultraviolet radiation on oxygen-containing molecules such as carbon dioxide.\nCold water holds more dissolved O2.\nThe unusually high concentration of oxygen gas on Earth is the result of the oxygen cycle. This biogeochemical cycle describes the movement of oxygen within and between its three main reservoirs on Earth: the atmosphere, the biosphere, and the lithosphere. The main driving factor of the oxygen cycle is photosynthesis, which is responsible for modern Earth's atmosphere. Photosynthesis releases oxygen into the atmosphere, while respiration, decay, and combustion remove it from the atmosphere. In the present equilibrium, production and consumption occur at the same rate.\nFree oxygen also occurs in solution in the world's water bodies. The increased solubility of O2 at lower temperatures (see Physical properties) has important implications for ocean life, as polar oceans support a much higher density of life due to their higher oxygen content. Water polluted with plant nutrients such as nitrates or phosphates may stimulate growth of algae by a process called eutrophication and the decay of these organisms and other biomaterials may reduce the O2 content in eutrophic water bodies. Scientists assess this aspect of water quality by measuring the water's biochemical oxygen demand, or the amount of O2 needed to restore it to a normal concentration.\nAnalysis\n500 million years of climate change vs. O\nPaleoclimatologists measure the ratio of oxygen-18 and oxygen-16 in the shells and skeletons of marine organisms to determine the climate millions of years ago (see oxygen isotope ratio cycle). Seawater molecules that contain the lighter isotope, oxygen-16, evaporate at a slightly faster rate than water molecules containing the 12% heavier oxygen-18, and this disparity increases at lower temperatures. During periods of lower global temperatures, snow and rain from that evaporated water tends to be higher in oxygen-16, and the seawater left behind tends to be higher in oxygen-18. Marine organisms then incorporate more oxygen-18 into their skeletons and shells than they would in a warmer climate. Paleoclimatologists also directly measure this ratio in the water molecules of ice core samples as old as hundreds of thousands of years.\nPlanetary geologists have measured the relative quantities of oxygen isotopes in samples from the Earth, the Moon, Mars, and meteorites, but were long unable to obtain reference values for the isotope ratios in the Sun, believed to be the same as those of the primordial solar nebula. Analysis of a silicon wafer exposed to the solar wind in space and returned by the crashed Genesis spacecraft has shown that the Sun has a higher proportion of oxygen-16 than does the Earth. The measurement implies that an unknown process depleted oxygen-16 from the Sun's disk of protoplanetary material prior to the coalescence of dust grains that formed the Earth.\nOxygen presents two spectrophotometric absorption bands peaking at the wavelengths 687 and 760\u00a0nm. Some remote sensing scientists have proposed using the measurement of the radiance coming from vegetation canopies in those bands to characterize plant health status from a satellite platform. This approach exploits the fact that in those bands it is possible to discriminate the vegetation's reflectance from its fluorescence, which is much weaker. The measurement is technically difficult owing to the low signal-to-noise ratio and the physical structure of vegetation; but it has been proposed as a possible method of monitoring the carbon cycle from satellites on a global scale.\n\n\nBiological production and role of O2\n\nMain article: Dioxygen in biological reactions\nPhotosynthesis and respiration\nPhotosynthesis splits water to liberate O2 and fixes CO2 into sugar in what is called a Calvin cycle.\nIn nature, free oxygen is produced by the light-driven splitting of water during oxygenic photosynthesis. According to some estimates, green algae and cyanobacteria in marine environments provide about 70% of the free oxygen produced on Earth, and the rest is produced by terrestrial plants. Other estimates of the oceanic contribution to atmospheric oxygen are higher, while some estimates are lower, suggesting oceans produce ~45% of Earth's atmospheric oxygen each year.\nA simplified overall formula for photosynthesis is\n6 CO2 + 6 H2O + photons \u2192 C6H12O6 + 6 O2\nor simply\ncarbon dioxide + water + sunlight \u2192 glucose + dioxygen\nPhotolytic oxygen evolution occurs in the thylakoid membranes of photosynthetic organisms and requires the energy of four photons. Many steps are involved, but the result is the formation of a proton gradient across the thylakoid membrane, which is used to synthesize adenosine triphosphate (ATP) via photophosphorylation. The O2 remaining (after production of the water molecule) is released into the atmosphere.\nOxygen is used in mitochondria in the generation of ATP during oxidative phosphorylation. The reaction for aerobic respiration is essentially the reverse of photosynthesis and is simplified as\nC6H12O6 + 6 O2 \u2192 6 CO2 + 6 H2O + 2880 kJ/mol\nIn vertebrates, O2 diffuses through membranes in the lungs and into red blood cells. Hemoglobin binds O2, changing color from bluish red to bright red (CO2 is released from another part of hemoglobin through the Bohr effect). Other animals use hemocyanin (molluscs and some arthropods) or hemerythrin (spiders and lobsters). A liter of blood can dissolve 200\u00a0cm of O2.\nUntil the discovery of anaerobic metazoa, oxygen was thought to be a requirement for all complex life.\nReactive oxygen species, such as superoxide ion (O2) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), are reactive by-products of oxygen use in organisms. Parts of the immune system of higher organisms create peroxide, superoxide, and singlet oxygen to destroy invading microbes. Reactive oxygen species also play an important role in the hypersensitive response of plants against pathogen attack. Oxygen is damaging to obligately anaerobic organisms, which were the dominant form of early life on Earth until O2 began to accumulate in the atmosphere about 2.5 billion years ago during the Great Oxygenation Event, about a billion years after the first appearance of these organisms.\nAn adult human at rest inhales 1.8 to 2.4\u00a0grams of oxygen per minute. This amounts to more than 6 billion tonnes of oxygen inhaled by humanity per year.\nLiving organisms\n\nPartial pressures of oxygen in the human body (PO2)\n\n\nUnit\nAlveolar pulmonary gas pressures\nArterial blood oxygen\nVenous blood gas\n\n\nkPa\n14.2\n11-13\n4.0-5.3\n\n\nmmHg\n107\n75-100\n30-40\nThe free oxygen partial pressure in the body of a living vertebrate organism is highest in the respiratory system, and decreases along any arterial system, peripheral tissues, and venous system, respectively. Partial pressure is the pressure that oxygen would have if it alone occupied the volume.\nBuild-up in the atmosphere\n\nMain article: Geological history of oxygen\nO2 build-up in Earth's atmosphere: 1) no O2 produced; 2) O2 produced, but absorbed in oceans & seabed rock; 3) O2 starts to gas out of the oceans, but is absorbed by land surfaces and formation of ozone layer; 4\u20135) O2 sinks filled and the gas accumulates\nFree oxygen gas was almost nonexistent in Earth's atmosphere before photosynthetic archaea and bacteria evolved, probably about 3.5 billion years ago. Free oxygen first appeared in significant quantities during the Paleoproterozoic era (between 3.0 and 2.3 billion years ago). Even if there was much dissolved iron in the oceans when oxygenic photosynthesis was getting more common, it appears the banded iron formations were created by anoxyenic or micro-aerophilic iron-oxidizing bacteria which dominated the deeper areas of the photic zone, while oxygen-producing cyanobacteria covered the shallows. Free oxygen began to outgas from the oceans 3\u20132.7\u00a0billion years ago, reaching 10% of its present level around 1.7\u00a0billion years ago.\nThe presence of large amounts of dissolved and free oxygen in the oceans and atmosphere may have driven most of the extant anaerobic organisms to extinction during the Great Oxygenation Event (oxygen catastrophe) about 2.4 billion years ago. Cellular respiration using O2 enables aerobic organisms to produce much more ATP than anaerobic organisms. Cellular respiration of O2 occurs in all eukaryotes, including all complex multicellular organisms such as plants and animals.\nSince the beginning of the Cambrian period 540 million years ago, atmospheric O2 levels have fluctuated between 15% and 30% by volume. Towards the end of the Carboniferous period (about 300\u00a0million years ago) atmospheric O2 levels reached a maximum of 35% by volume, which may have contributed to the large size of insects and amphibians at this time.\nVariations in atmospheric oxygen concentration have shaped past climates. When oxygen declined, atmospheric density dropped, which in turn increased surface evaporation, causing precipitation increases and warmer temperatures.\nAt the current rate of photosynthesis it would take about 2,000\u00a0years to regenerate the entire O2 in the present atmosphere.\n\nIt is estimated that oxygen on Earth will last for about one billion years.\nExtraterrestrial free oxygen\n\nMain article: Extraterrestrial atmosphere\nIn the field of astrobiology and in the search for extraterrestrial life oxygen is a strong biosignature. That said it might not be a definite biosignature, being possibly produced abiotically on celestial bodies with processes and conditions (such as a peculiar hydrosphere) which allow free oxygen, like with Europa's and Ganymede's thin oxygen atmospheres.\n\nIndustrial production\n\nSee also: Air separation, Oxygen evolution, and Fractional distillation\nHofmann electrolysis apparatus used in electrolysis of water.\nOne hundred\u00a0million\u00a0tonnes of O2 are extracted from air for industrial uses annually by two primary methods. The most common method is fractional distillation of liquefied air, with N2 distilling as a vapor while O2 is left as a liquid.\nThe other primary method of producing O2 is passing a stream of clean, dry air through one bed of a pair of identical zeolite molecular sieves, which absorbs the nitrogen and delivers a gas stream that is 90%\u00a0to\u00a093% O2. Simultaneously, nitrogen gas is released from the other nitrogen-saturated zeolite bed, by reducing the chamber operating pressure and diverting part of the oxygen gas from the producer bed through it, in the reverse direction of flow. After a set cycle time the operation of the two beds is interchanged, thereby allowing for a continuous supply of gaseous oxygen to be pumped through a pipeline. This is known as pressure swing adsorption. Oxygen gas is increasingly obtained by these non-cryogenic technologies (see also the related vacuum swing adsorption).\nOxygen gas can also be produced through electrolysis of water into molecular oxygen and hydrogen. DC electricity must be used: if AC is used, the gases in each limb consist of hydrogen and oxygen in the explosive ratio 2:1. A similar method is the electrocatalytic O2 evolution from oxides and oxoacids. Chemical catalysts can be used as well, such as in chemical oxygen generators or oxygen candles that are used as part of the life-support equipment on submarines, and are still part of standard equipment on commercial airliners in case of depressurization emergencies. Another air separation method is forcing air to dissolve through ceramic membranes based on zirconium dioxide by either high pressure or an electric current, to produce nearly pure O2 gas.\n\nStorage\nOxygen and MAPP gas compressed-gas cylinders with regulators\nOxygen storage methods include high-pressure oxygen tanks, cryogenics and chemical compounds. For reasons of economy, oxygen is often transported in bulk as a liquid in specially insulated tankers, since one liter of liquefied oxygen is equivalent to 840\u00a0liters of gaseous oxygen at atmospheric pressure and 20\u00a0\u00b0C (68\u00a0\u00b0F). Such tankers are used to refill bulk liquid-oxygen storage containers, which stand outside hospitals and other institutions that need large volumes of pure oxygen gas. Liquid oxygen is passed through heat exchangers, which convert the cryogenic liquid into gas before it enters the building. Oxygen is also stored and shipped in smaller cylinders containing the compressed gas; a form that is useful in certain portable medical applications and oxy-fuel welding and cutting.\n\nApplications\n\nSee also: Breathing gas, Redox, and Combustion\nMedical\nAn oxygen concentrator in an emphysema patient's house\n\nMain article: Oxygen therapy\nUptake of O2 from the air is the essential purpose of respiration, so oxygen supplementation is used in medicine. Treatment not only increases oxygen levels in the patient's blood, but has the secondary effect of decreasing resistance to blood flow in many types of diseased lungs, easing work load on the heart. Oxygen therapy is used to treat emphysema, pneumonia, some heart disorders (congestive heart failure), some disorders that cause increased pulmonary artery pressure, and any disease that impairs the body's ability to take up and use gaseous oxygen.\nTreatments are flexible enough to be used in hospitals, the patient's home, or increasingly by portable devices. Oxygen tents were once commonly used in oxygen supplementation, but have since been replaced mostly by the use of oxygen masks or nasal cannulas.\nHyperbaric (high-pressure) medicine uses special oxygen chambers to increase the partial pressure of O2 around the patient and, when needed, the medical staff. Carbon monoxide poisoning, gas gangrene, and decompression sickness (the 'bends') are sometimes addressed with this therapy. Increased O2 concentration in the lungs helps to displace carbon monoxide from the heme group of hemoglobin. Oxygen gas is poisonous to the anaerobic bacteria that cause gas gangrene, so increasing its partial pressure helps kill them. Decompression sickness occurs in divers who decompress too quickly after a dive, resulting in bubbles of inert gas, mostly nitrogen and helium, forming in the blood. Increasing the pressure of O2 as soon as possible helps to redissolve the bubbles back into the blood so that these excess gasses can be exhaled naturally through the lungs. Normobaric oxygen administration at the highest available concentration is frequently used as first aid for any diving injury that may involve inert gas bubble formation in the tissues. There is epidemiological support for its use from a statistical study of cases recorded in a long term database.\n\nLife support and recreational use\nLow-pressure pure O2 is used in space suits.\nAn application of O2 as a low-pressure breathing gas is in modern space suits, which surround their occupant's body with the breathing gas. These devices use nearly pure oxygen at about one-third normal pressure, resulting in a normal blood partial pressure of O2. This trade-off of higher oxygen concentration for lower pressure is needed to maintain suit flexibility.\nScuba and surface-supplied underwater divers and submariners also rely on artificially delivered O2. Submarines, submersibles and atmospheric diving suits usually operate at normal atmospheric pressure. Breathing air is scrubbed of carbon dioxide by chemical extraction and oxygen is replaced to maintain a constant partial pressure. Ambient pressure divers breathe air or gas mixtures with an oxygen fraction suited to the operating depth. Pure or nearly pure O2 use in diving at pressures higher than atmospheric is usually limited to rebreathers, or decompression at relatively shallow depths (~6 meters depth, or less), or medical treatment in recompression chambers at pressures up to 2.8 bar, where acute oxygen toxicity can be managed without the risk of drowning. Deeper diving requires significant dilution of O2 with other gases, such as nitrogen or helium, to prevent oxygen toxicity.\nPeople who climb mountains or fly in non-pressurized fixed-wing aircraft sometimes have supplemental O2 supplies. Pressurized commercial airplanes have an emergency supply of O2 automatically supplied to the passengers in case of cabin depressurization. Sudden cabin pressure loss activates chemical oxygen generators above each seat, causing oxygen masks to drop. Pulling on the masks \"to start the flow of oxygen\" as cabin safety instructions dictate, forces iron filings into the sodium chlorate inside the canister. A steady stream of oxygen gas is then produced by the exothermic reaction.\nOxygen, as a mild euphoric, has a history of recreational use in oxygen bars and in sports. Oxygen bars are establishments found in the United States since the late 1990s that offer higher than normal O2 exposure for a minimal fee. Professional athletes, especially in American football, sometimes go off-field between plays to don oxygen masks to boost performance. The pharmacological effect is doubted; a placebo effect is a more likely explanation. Available studies support a performance boost from oxygen enriched mixtures only if it is inhaled during aerobic exercise.\nOther recreational uses that do not involve breathing include pyrotechnic applications, such as George Goble's five-second ignition of barbecue grills.\nIndustrial\nMost commercially produced O2 is used to smelt and/or decarburize iron.\nSmelting of iron ore into steel consumes 55% of commercially produced oxygen. In this process, O2 is injected through a high-pressure lance into molten iron, which removes sulfur impurities and excess carbon as the respective oxides, SO2 and CO2. The reactions are exothermic, so the temperature increases to 1,700\u00a0\u00b0C.\nAnother 25% of commercially produced oxygen is used by the chemical industry. Ethylene is reacted with O2 to create ethylene oxide, which, in turn, is converted into ethylene glycol; the primary feeder material used to manufacture a host of products, including antifreeze and polyester polymers (the precursors of many plastics and fabrics).\nMost of the remaining 20% of commercially produced oxygen is used in medical applications, metal cutting and welding, as an oxidizer in rocket fuel, and in water treatment. Oxygen is used in oxyacetylene welding, burning acetylene with O2 to produce a very hot flame. In this process, metal up to 60\u00a0cm (24\u00a0in) thick is first heated with a small oxy-acetylene flame and then quickly cut by a large stream of O2.\n\nCompounds\n\nMain article: Compounds of oxygen\nWater (H2O) is the most familiar oxygen compound.\nThe oxidation state of oxygen is \u22122 in almost all known compounds of oxygen. The oxidation state \u22121 is found in a few compounds such as peroxides. Compounds containing oxygen in other oxidation states are very uncommon: \u22121/2 (superoxides), \u22121/3 (ozonides), 0 (elemental, hypofluorous acid), +1/2 (dioxygenyl), +1 (dioxygen difluoride), and +2 (oxygen difluoride).\nOxides and other inorganic compounds\nWater (H2O) is an oxide of hydrogen and the most familiar oxygen compound. Hydrogen atoms are covalently bonded to oxygen in a water molecule but also have an additional attraction (about 23.3\u00a0kJ/mol per hydrogen atom) to an adjacent oxygen atom in a separate molecule. These hydrogen bonds between water molecules hold them approximately 15% closer than what would be expected in a simple liquid with just van der Waals forces.\nOxides, such as iron oxide or rust, form when oxygen combines with other elements.\nDue to its electronegativity, oxygen forms chemical bonds with almost all other elements to give corresponding oxides. The surface of most metals, such as aluminium and titanium, are oxidized in the presence of air and become coated with a thin film of oxide that passivates the metal and slows further corrosion. Many oxides of the transition metals are non-stoichiometric compounds, with slightly less metal than the chemical formula would show. For example, the mineral FeO (w\u00fcstite) is written as \n\n\n\n\n\nFe\n\n\n1\n\u2212\nx\n\n\n\nO\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\ce {Fe}}_{1-x}{\\ce {O}}}\n\n, where x is usually around 0.05.\nOxygen is present in the atmosphere in trace quantities in the form of carbon dioxide (CO2). The Earth's crustal rock is composed in large part of oxides of silicon (silica SiO2, as found in granite and quartz), aluminium (aluminium oxide Al2O3, in bauxite and corundum), iron (iron(III) oxide Fe2O3, in hematite and rust), and calcium carbonate (in limestone). The rest of the Earth's crust is also made of oxygen compounds, in particular various complex silicates (in silicate minerals). The Earth's mantle, of much larger mass than the crust, is largely composed of silicates of magnesium and iron.\nWater-soluble silicates in the form of Na4SiO4, Na2SiO3, and Na2Si2O5 are used as detergents and adhesives.\nOxygen also acts as a ligand for transition metals, forming transition metal dioxygen complexes, which feature metal\u2013O2. This class of compounds includes the heme proteins hemoglobin and myoglobin. An exotic and unusual reaction occurs with PtF6, which oxidizes oxygen to give O2PtF6, dioxygenyl hexafluoroplatinate.\nOrganic compounds\nAcetone is an important feeder material in the chemical industry. \u00a0\u00a0Oxygen \u00a0\u00a0Carbon \u00a0\u00a0Hydrogen\nAmong the most important classes of organic compounds that contain oxygen are (where \"R\" is an organic group): alcohols (R-OH); ethers (R-O-R); ketones (R-CO-R); aldehydes (R-CO-H); carboxylic acids (R-COOH); esters (R-COO-R); acid anhydrides (R-CO-O-CO-R); and amides (R-CO-NR2). There are many important organic solvents that contain oxygen, including: acetone, methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, furan, THF, diethyl ether, dioxane, ethyl acetate, DMF, DMSO, acetic acid, and formic acid. Acetone ((CH3)2CO) and phenol (C6H5OH) are used as feeder materials in the synthesis of many different substances. Other important organic compounds that contain oxygen are: glycerol, formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde, citric acid, acetic anhydride, and acetamide. Epoxides are ethers in which the oxygen atom is part of a ring of three atoms. The element is similarly found in almost all biomolecules that are important to (or generated by) life.\nOxygen reacts spontaneously with many organic compounds at or below room temperature in a process called autoxidation. Most of the organic compounds that contain oxygen are not made by direct action of O2. Organic compounds important in industry and commerce that are made by direct oxidation of a precursor include ethylene oxide and peracetic acid.\n\nSafety and precautions\nOxygen\n\n\nHazards\n\n\nGHS labelling:\n\n\nPictograms\n\n\n\n\nHazard statements\n\nH272\n\n\nPrecautionary statements\n\nP220, P244, P370+P376, P403\n\n\nNFPA 704 (fire\u00a0diamond)\n\n\n\n0\n0\n1OX\nChemical compound\nThe NFPA 704 standard rates compressed oxygen gas as nonhazardous to health, nonflammable and nonreactive, but an oxidizer. Refrigerated liquid oxygen (LOX) is given a health hazard rating of 3 (for increased risk of hyperoxia from condensed vapors, and for hazards common to cryogenic liquids such as frostbite), and all other ratings are the same as the compressed gas form.\nToxicity\n\nMain article: Oxygen toxicity\nMain symptoms of oxygen toxicity\nOxygen gas (O2) can be toxic at elevated partial pressures, leading to convulsions and other health problems. Oxygen toxicity usually begins to occur at partial pressures more than 50 kilopascals\u00a0(kPa), equal to about 50% oxygen composition at standard pressure or 2.5 times the normal sea-level O2 partial pressure of about 21\u00a0kPa. This is not a problem except for patients on mechanical ventilators, since gas supplied through oxygen masks in medical applications is typically composed of only 30\u201350% O2 by volume (about 30\u00a0kPa at standard pressure).\nAt one time, premature babies were placed in incubators containing O2-rich air, but this practice was discontinued after some babies were blinded by the oxygen content being too high.\nBreathing pure O2 in space applications, such as in some modern space suits, or in early spacecraft such as Apollo, causes no damage due to the low total pressures used. In the case of spacesuits, the O2 partial pressure in the breathing gas is, in general, about 30\u00a0kPa (1.4 times normal), and the resulting O2 partial pressure in the astronaut's arterial blood is only marginally more than normal sea-level O2 partial pressure.\nOxygen toxicity to the lungs and central nervous system can also occur in deep scuba diving and surface supplied diving. Prolonged breathing of an air mixture with an O2 partial pressure more than 60\u00a0kPa can eventually lead to permanent pulmonary fibrosis. Exposure to an O2 partial pressure greater than 160\u00a0kPa (about 1.6 atm) may lead to convulsions (normally fatal for divers). Acute oxygen toxicity (causing seizures, its most feared effect for divers) can occur by breathing an air mixture with 21% O2 at 66\u00a0m (217\u00a0ft) or more of depth; the same thing can occur by breathing 100% O2 at only 6\u00a0m (20\u00a0ft).\nCombustion and other hazards\nThe interior of the Apollo 1 Command Module. Pure O2 at higher than normal pressure and a spark led to a fire and the loss of the Apollo 1 crew.\nHighly concentrated sources of oxygen promote rapid combustion. Fire and explosion hazards exist when concentrated oxidants and fuels are brought into close proximity; an ignition event, such as heat or a spark, is needed to trigger combustion. Oxygen is the oxidant, not the fuel.\nConcentrated O2 will allow combustion to proceed rapidly and energetically. Steel pipes and storage vessels used to store and transmit both gaseous and liquid oxygen will act as a fuel; and therefore the design and manufacture of O2 systems requires special training to ensure that ignition sources are minimized. The fire that killed the Apollo 1 crew in a launch pad test spread so rapidly because the capsule was pressurized with pure O2 but at slightly more than atmospheric pressure, instead of the 1\u20443 normal pressure that would be used in a mission.\nLiquid oxygen spills, if allowed to soak into organic matter, such as wood, petrochemicals, and asphalt can cause these materials to detonate unpredictably on subsequent mechanical impact.\n\n\nSee also\nGeological history of oxygen\nHypoxia (environmental) for O2 depletion in aquatic ecology\nOcean deoxygenation\nHypoxia (medical), a lack of oxygen\nLimiting oxygen concentration\nOxygen compounds\nOxygen plant\nOxygen sensor\nPortals:\u00a0Chemistry\u00a0Medicine\nOxygen at Wikipedia's sister projects:Definitions from WiktionaryMedia from CommonsQuotations from WikiquoteTextbooks from WikibooksResources from Wikiversity\n\nNotes\n^ These results were mostly ignored until 1860.

    "content": "The ventrolateral preoptic nucleus (VLPO), also known as the intermediate nucleus of the preoptic area (IPA), is a small cluster of neurons situated in the anterior hypothalamus, sitting just above and to the side of the optic chiasm in the brain of humans and other animals. The brain's sleep-promoting nuclei (e.g., the VLPO, parafacial zone, nucleus accumbens core, and lateral hypothalamic MCH neurons), together with the ascending arousal system which includes components in the brainstem, hypothalamus and basal forebrain, are the interconnected neural systems which control states of arousal, sleep, and transitions between these two states. The VLPO is active during sleep, particularly during non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREM sleep), and releases inhibitory neurotransmitters, mainly GABA and galanin, which inhibit neurons of the ascending arousal system that are involved in wakefulness and arousal. The VLPO is in turn innervated by neurons from several components of the ascending arousal system. The VLPO is activated by the endogenous sleep-promoting substances adenosine and prostaglandin D2. The VLPO is inhibited during wakefulness by the arousal-inducing neurotransmitters norepinephrine and acetylcholine. The role of the VLPO in sleep and wakefulness, and its association with sleep disorders \u2013 particularly insomnia and narcolepsy \u2013 is a growing area of neuroscience research.\n\nStructure[edit]\nAt least 80% of neurons in the VLPO that project to the ascending arousal system are GABAergic (neurons that produce GABA).\nIn vitro studies in rats have shown that many neurons in the VLPO that are inhibited by norepinephrine or acetylcholine are multipolar triangular shaped cells with low threshold spikes.   These triangular multipolar neurons exist in two sub-populations in the VLPO:\nType 1 \u2013 inhibited by serotonin.\nType 2 \u2013 excited by serotonin and adenosine.\nAs adenosine accumulates during wakefulness it is likely that type 2 cells play a role in sleep induction.\nThe remaining third of neurons in the VLPO are excited by norepinephrine. Their role is unclear.\n\nFunction[edit]\nSleep/wakefulness[edit]\nSchematic representation of the Flip-Flop Switch Hypothesis\nIn the early 20th century, Constantin von Economo noted that humans who had encephalitis with lesions in the anterior hypothalamus had insomnia, and proposed a sleep-promoting influence from that area.  Animal studies in the mid-20th century in rats and cats confirmed that very large lesions in the preoptic area and basal forebrain resulted in insomnia but did not identify the cell group that was responsible.  In 1996, Sherin and colleagues reported the presence of a cell group in the VLPO that expresses cFos (a protein often found in neurons that have recently been active) during sleep, and that these neurons contain the inhibitory neurotransmitters GABA and galanin.  These same neurons were found to innervate components of the ascending arousal system, including the tuberomammillary nucleus (TMN) and other components of the lateral hypothalamus; the raphe nuclei; the locus coeruleus (LC); the pedunculopontine (PPT) and laterodorsal tegmental nuclei (LDT); and the parabrachial nucleus (PB). More recent studies using opto- or chemogenetic activation of VLPO neurons have confirmed that they promote sleep.\nThe sleep-promoting effects of the VLPO neurons is thought to be due to release of GABA and possibly galanin that suppresses firing of arousal system neurons. As the VLPO is also inhibited by neurotransmitters released by components of the arousal systems, such as acetylcholine and norepinephrine, a current theory has proposed that the VLPO and the arousal system form a \"flip-flop\" circuit. This term from electrical engineering denotes a circuit in which mutual inhibition means that each component of the circuit, as it turns on, turns the other off, resulting in rapid transitions from one state (wake or sleep) to the other, with minimal time in transition states.  This theory has been used to create mathematical models that explain much of the wake-sleep behavior in animals, including in pathological states and responses to drugs. Orexin neurons in the posterior lateral hypothalamus potentiate neurons in the ascending arousal system and help stabilize the brain in the waking state (and consolidated wakefulness, which builds up homeostatic sleep drive, helps stabilize the brain during later sleep). The loss of orexin neurons in the disorder narcolepsy destabilizes the wake-sleep switch, resulting in overwhelming sleep episodes during the waking day, as well as more frequent awakenings from sleep at night.\nCircadian rhythm[edit]\nThere is a strong circadian rhythm of sleep in mammals. The \u201cmaster clock\u201d for circadian rhythms in mammals is the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). The SCN has little if any projection directly to the VLPO neurons. Instead, they project strongly to the adjacent subparaventricular zone, which in turn contains inhibitory GABAergic neurons that innervate the dorsomedial nucleus of the hypothalamus.  Lesions of the dorsomedial nucleus almost completely eliminate the circadian rhythm of sleep.  GABAergic neurons in the dorsomedial nucleus innervate the VLPO, and glutamatergic neurons innervate the lateral hypothalamus, suggesting that the dorsomedial nucleus mainly promotes wakefulness during the active period (daytime for humans).\n\nClinical significance[edit]\nInsomnia[edit]\nElderly human patients with more galanin neurons in their intermediate nucleus (the human equivalent of the VLPO galanin neurons in rodents) have better, more continuous sleep. A reduced number of VLPO neurons is associated with more fragmented sleep (more awakenings throughout the night).\nLesions in the VLPO in rats results in 50-60% decrease in NREM sleep time and prolonged insomnia. More recent research suggests that stress-induced insomnia could be due to an imbalance of input to arousal system and VLPO neurons.\nSedative/hypnotic drugs[edit]\nMany sedative/hypnotic drugs act by binding to and potentiating GABA-A receptors.  These include older drugs such as ethanol, chloral hydrate and barbiturates, as well as newer benzodiazepines and \"non-benzodiazepine\" drugs (such as zolpidem, which bind to the same receptor but have a different chemical configuration), and even anesthetics such as propofol and isoflurane.  As the VLPO inputs to the arousal system use this same receptor, these drugs at low doses essentially act by potentiating the VLPO, producing a sleepy state. Animal studies show that VLPO neurons show cFos activation after sedative doses of these drugs, and that VLPO lesions produce resistance to their sedative effects.  However, at high doses that produce a surgical plane of anesthesia, these drugs have much more widespread inhibitory effects, that do not depend upon the VLPO. Studies have shown that multiple sedative/hypnotic drugs that act by potentiating GABA-A receptors, including ethanol, chloral hydrate, propofol and gas anesthetics such as isoflurane, at sedative doses increase the activity of the VLPO neurons in mice. This finding suggests that at relatively low sedative doses, these medications may have a common mechanism of action, which includes potentiating the firing of VLPO neurons.  High doses used in surgical anesthesia, however, reduce activity of neurons throughout the nervous system."

    "content": "\nA healthy diet is a diet that maintains or improves overall health. A healthy diet provides the body with essential nutrition: fluid, macronutrients such as protein, micronutrients such as vitamins, and adequate fibre and food energy.\nA healthy diet may contain fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, and may include little to no ultra-processed foods or sweetened beverages.  The requirements for a healthy diet can be met from a variety of plant-based and animal-based foods, although additional sources of vitamin B12 are needed for those following a vegan diet. Various nutrition guides are published by medical and governmental institutions to educate individuals on what they should be eating to be healthy. Nutrition facts labels are also mandatory in some countries to allow consumers to choose between foods based on the components relevant to health.\n\nRecommendations\nWorld Health Organization\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) makes the following five recommendations with respect to both populations and individuals:\nMaintain a healthy weight by eating roughly the same number of calories that your body is using.\nLimit intake of fats to no more than 30% of total caloric intake, preferring unsaturated fats to saturated fats. Avoid trans fats.\nEat at least 400 grams of fruits and vegetables per day (not counting potatoes, sweet potatoes, cassava, and other starchy roots). A healthy diet also contains legumes (e.g. lentils, beans), whole grains, and nuts.\nLimit the intake of simple sugars to less than 10% of caloric intake (below 5% of calories or 25 grams may be even better).\nLimit salt/sodium from all sources and ensure that salt is iodized. Less than 5 grams of salt per day can reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.\nThe WHO has stated that insufficient vegetables and fruit is the cause of 2.8% of deaths worldwide.\nOther WHO recommendations include:\nensuring that the foods chosen have sufficient vitamins and certain minerals;\navoiding directly poisonous (e.g. heavy metals) and carcinogenic (e.g. benzene) substances;\navoiding foods contaminated by human pathogens (e.g. E. coli, tapeworm eggs);\nand replacing saturated fats with polyunsaturated fats in the diet, which can reduce the risk of coronary artery disease and diabetes.\nUnited States Department of Agriculture\nMain article: History of USDA nutrition guides\n\nMain article: MyPlate\nThe Dietary Guidelines for Americans by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) recommends three healthy patterns of diet, summarized in the table below, for a 2000 kcal diet. These guidelines are increasingly adopted by various groups and institutions for recipe and meal plan development.\nThe guidelines emphasize both health and environmental sustainability and a flexible approach. The committee that drafted it wrote: \"The major findings regarding sustainable diets were that a diet higher in plant-based foods, such as vegetables, fruits, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds, and lower in calories and animal-based foods is more health promoting and is associated with less environmental impact than is the current U.S. diet. This pattern of eating can be achieved through a variety of dietary patterns, including the \"Healthy U.S.-style Pattern\", the \"Healthy Vegetarian Pattern\" and the \"Healthy Mediterranean-style Pattern\". Food group amounts are per day, unless noted per week.\nThe three healthy patterns\n\n\nFood group/subgroup (units)\n\nU.S. style\n\nVegetarian\n\nMed-style\n\n\nFruits (cup eq)\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n\nVegetables (cup eq)\n\n2.5\n\n2.5\n\n2.5\n\n\nDark green\n\n1.5/wk\n\n1.5/wk\n\n1.5/wk\n\n\nRed/orange\n\n5.5/wk\n\n5.5/wk\n\n5.5/wk\n\n\nStarchy\n\n5/wk\n\n5/wk\n\n5/wk\n\n\nLegumes\n\n1.5/wk\n\n3/wk\n\n1.5/wk\n\n\nOthers\n\n4/wk\n\n4/wk\n\n4/wk\n\n\nGrains (oz eq)\n\n6\n\n6.5\n\n6\n\n\nWhole\n\n3\n\n3.5\n\n3\n\n\nRefined\n\n3\n\n3\n\n3\n\n\nDairy (cup eq)\n\n3\n\n3\n\n2\n\n\nProtein Foods (oz eq)\n\n5.5\n\n3.5\n\n6.5\n\n\nMeat (red and processed)\n\n12.5/wk\n\n\u2013\n\n12.5/wk\n\n\nPoultry\n\n10.5/wk\n\n\u2013\n\n10.5/wk\n\n\nSeafood\n\n8/wk\n\n\u2013\n\n15/wk\n\n\nEggs\n\n3/wk\n\n3/wk\n\n3/wk\n\n\nNuts/seeds\n\n4/wk\n\n7/wk\n\n4/wk\n\n\nProcessed Soy (including tofu)\n\n0.5/wk\n\n8/wk\n\n0.5/wk\n\n\nOils (grams)\n\n27\n\n27\n\n27\n\n\nSolid fats limit (grams)\n\n18\n\n21\n\n17\n\n\nAdded sugars limit (grams)\n\n30\n\n36\n\n29\nAmerican Heart Association / World Cancer Research Fund / American Institute for Cancer Research\nThe American Heart Association, World Cancer Research Fund, and American Institute for Cancer Research recommend a diet that consists mostly of unprocessed plant foods, with emphasis on a wide range of whole grains, legumes, and non-starchy vegetables and fruits. This healthy diet includes a wide range of non-starchy vegetables and fruits which provide different colors including red, green, yellow, white, purple, and orange. The recommendations note that tomato cooked with oil, allium vegetables like garlic, and cruciferous vegetables like cauliflower, provide some protection against cancer. This healthy diet is low in energy density, which may protect against weight gain and associated diseases. Finally, limiting consumption of sugary drinks, limiting energy-rich foods, including \"fast foods\" and red meat, and avoiding processed meats improves health and longevity. Overall, researchers and medical policymakers conclude that this healthy diet can reduce the risk of chronic disease and cancer.\nIt is recommended that children consume 25 grams or less of added sugar (100 calories) per day. Other recommendations include no extra sugars in those under two years old and less than one soft drink per week. As of 2017, decreasing total fat is no longer recommended, but instead, the recommendation to lower risk of cardiovascular disease is to increase consumption of monounsaturated fats and polyunsaturated fats, while decreasing consumption of saturated fats.\nHarvard School of Public Health\nThe Nutrition Source of Harvard School of Public Health (HSPH) makes the following dietary recommendations:\nEat healthy fats: healthy fats are necessary and beneficial for health. HSPH \"recommends the opposite of the low-fat message promoted for decades by the USDA\" and \"does not set a maximum on the percentage of calories people should get each day from healthy sources of fat.\" Healthy fats include polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats, found in vegetable oils, nuts, seeds, and fish. Foods containing trans fats are to be avoided, while foods high in saturated fats like red meat, butter, cheese, ice cream, coconut and palm oil negatively impact health and should be limited.\nEat healthy protein: the majority of protein should come from plant sources when possible: lentils, beans, nuts, seeds, whole grains; avoid processed meats like bacon.\nEat mostly vegetables, fruit, and whole grains.\nDrink water. Consume sugary beverages, juices, and milk only in moderation. Artificially sweetened beverages contribute to weight gain because sweet drinks cause cravings. 100% fruit juice is high in calories. The ideal amount of milk and calcium is not known today.\nPay attention to salt intake from commercially prepared foods: most of the dietary salt comes from processed foods, \"not from salt added to cooking at home or even from salt added at the table before eating.\"\nVitamins and minerals: must be obtained from food because they are not produced in our body. They are provided by a diet containing healthy fats, healthy protein, vegetables, fruit, milk and whole grains.\nPay attention to the carbohydrates package: the type of carbohydrates in the diet is more important than the amount of carbohydrates. Good sources for carbohydrates are vegetables, fruits, beans, and whole grains. Avoid sugared sodas, 100% fruit juice, artificially sweetened drinks, and other highly processed food.\nOther than nutrition, the guide recommends staying active and maintaining a healthy body weight.\nOthers\nDavid L. Katz, who reviewed the most prevalent popular diets in 2014, noted:\nThe weight of evidence strongly supports a theme of healthful eating while allowing for variations on that theme. A diet of minimally processed foods close to nature, predominantly plants, is decisively associated with health promotion and disease prevention and is consistent with the salient components of seemingly distinct dietary approaches.\nEfforts to improve public health through diet are forestalled not for want of knowledge about the optimal feeding of Homo sapiens but for distractions associated with exaggerated claims, and our failure to convert what we reliably know into what we routinely do. Knowledge in this case is not, as of yet, power; would that it were so.\nMarion Nestle expresses the mainstream view among scientists who study nutrition:\nThe basic principles of good diets are so simple that I can summarize them in just ten words: eat less, move more, eat lots of fruits and vegetables. For additional clarification, a five-word modifier helps: go easy on junk foods. Follow these precepts and you will go a long way toward preventing the major diseases of our overfed society\u2014coronary heart disease, certain cancers, diabetes, stroke, osteoporosis, and a host of others.... These precepts constitute the bottom line of what seem to be the far more complicated dietary recommendations of many health organizations and national and international governments\u2014the forty-one \"key recommendations\" of the 2005 Dietary Guidelines, for example. ... Although you may feel as though advice about nutrition is constantly changing, the basic ideas behind my four precepts have not changed in half a century. And they leave plenty of room for enjoying the pleasures of food.\nHistorically, a healthy diet was defined as a diet comprising more than 55% of carbohydrates, less than 30% of fat and about 15% of proteins. This view is currently shifting towards a more comprehensive framing of dietary needs as a global need of various nutrients with complex interactions, instead of per nutrient type needs.\n\nSpecific conditions\nDiabetes\nA healthy diet in combination with being active can help those with diabetes keep their blood sugar in check. The US CDC advises individuals with diabetes to plan for regular, balanced meals and to include more nonstarchy vegetables, reduce added sugars and refined grains, and focus on whole foods instead of highly processed foods. Generally, people with diabetes and those at risk are encouraged to  increase their fiber intake.\nHypertension\nA low-sodium diet is beneficial for people with high blood pressure. A 2008 Cochrane review  concluded that a long-term (more than four weeks) low-sodium diet lowers blood pressure, both in people with hypertension (high blood pressure) and in those with normal blood pressure.\nThe DASH diet (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) is a diet promoted by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (part of the NIH, a United States government organization) to control hypertension. A major feature of the plan is limiting intake of sodium, and the diet also generally encourages the consumption of nuts, whole grains, fish, poultry, fruits, and vegetables while lowering the consumption of red meats, sweets, and sugar. It is also \"rich in potassium, magnesium, and calcium, as well as protein\".\nThe Mediterranean diet, which includes limiting consumption of red meat and using olive oil in cooking, has also been shown to improve cardiovascular outcomes.\nObesity\n\nFurther information: Dieting\nHealthy diets in combination with physical exercise can be used by people who are overweight or obese to lose weight, although this approach is not by itself an effective long-term treatment for obesity and is primarily effective for only a short period (up to one year), after which some of the weight is typically regained. A meta-analysis found no difference between diet types (low-fat, low-carbohydrate, and low-calorie), with a 2\u20134 kilograms (4.4\u20138.8\u00a0lb) weight loss. This level of weight loss is by itself insufficient to move a person from an 'obese' body mass index (BMI) category to a 'normal' BMI.\nGluten-related disorders\n\nFurther information: Gluten-free diet\nGluten, a mixture of proteins found in wheat and related grains including barley, rye, oat, and all their species and hybrids (such as spelt, kamut, and triticale), causes health problems for those with gluten-related disorders, including celiac disease, non-celiac gluten sensitivity, gluten ataxia, dermatitis herpetiformis, and wheat allergy. In these people, the gluten-free diet is the only available treatment.\nEpilepsy\n\nFurther information: Ketogenic diet\nThe ketogenic diet is a treatment to reduce epileptic seizures for adults and children when managed by a health care team.\n\nResearch\n\nFurther information: Diet and cancer\nPreliminary research indicated that a diet high in fruit and vegetables may decrease the risk of cardiovascular disease and death, but not cancer. Eating a healthy diet and getting enough exercise can maintain body weight within the normal range and reduce the risk of obesity in most people. A 2021 scientific review of evidence on diets for lowering the risk of atherosclerosis found that:\nlow consumption of salt and foods of animal origin, and increased intake of plant-based foods\u2014whole grains, fruits, vegetables, legumes, and nuts\u2014are linked with reduced atherosclerosis risk. The same applies for the replacement of butter and other animal/tropical fats with olive oil and other unsaturated-fat-rich oil. [...] With regard to meat, new evidence differentiates processed and red meat\u2014both associated with increased CVD risk\u2014from poultry, showing a neutral relationship with CVD for moderate intakes. [...] New data endorse the replacement of most high glycemic index (GI) foods with both whole grain and low GI cereal foods.\nScientific research is also investigating impacts of nutrition on health- and lifespans beyond any specific range of diseases.\n\nThis section is transcluded from Life extension#Healthy diet. (edit | history)\nResearch suggests that increasing adherence to Mediterranean diet patterns is associated with a reduction in total and cause-specific mortality, extending health- and lifespan. Research is identifying the key beneficial components of the Mediterranean diet. Studies suggest dietary changes are a factor of national relative rises in life-span.\nOptimal diet\n\nSee also: Sustainable consumption \u00a7\u00a0Sustainable food consumption\nApproaches to develop optimal diets for health- and lifespan (or \"longevity diets\") include:\nmodifying the Mediterranean diet as the baseline via nutrition science. For instance, via:\n(additional) increase in plant-based foods alongside additional restriction of meat intake \u2013 meat reduction is (or can be) typically healthy,\nkeeping alcohol consumption of any type at a minimum \u2013 conventional Mediterranean diets include alcohol consumption (i.e. of wine), which is under research due to data suggesting negative long-term brain impacts even at low/moderate consumption levels.\nfully replacing refined grains \u2013 some guidelines of Mediterranean diets do not clarify or include the principle of whole-grain consumption instead of refined grains. Whole grains are included in  Mediterranean diets.\nMoreover, not only do the components of diets matter but the total caloric content and eating patterns may also impact health \u2013 dietary restriction such as caloric restriction is considered to be potentially healthy to include in eating patterns in various ways in terms of health- and lifespan.\n\nUnhealthy diets\nAn unhealthy diet is a major risk factor for a number of chronic diseases including: high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, abnormal blood lipids, overweight/obesity, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer. The World Health Organization has estimated that 2.7 million deaths each year are attributable to a diet low in fruit and vegetables during the 21st century. Globally, such diets are estimated to cause about 19% of gastrointestinal cancer, 31% of ischaemic heart disease, and 11% of strokes, thus making it one of the leading preventable causes of death worldwide, and the 4th leading risk factor for any disease. As an example, the Western pattern diet is \"rich in red meat, dairy products, processed and artificially sweetened foods, and salt, with minimal intake of fruits, vegetables, fish, legumes, and whole grains,\" contrasted by the Mediterranean diet which is associated with less morbidity and mortality.\nDietary patterns that lead to non-communicable diseases generate productivity losses. A true cost accounting (TCA) assessment on the hidden impacts of agrifood systems estimated that unhealthy dietary patterns generate more than USD 9 trillion in health-related hidden costs in 2020, which is 73 percent of the total quantified hidden costs of global agrifood systems (USD 12.7 trillion). Globally, the average productivity losses per person from dietary intake is equivalent to 7 percent of GDP purchasing power parity (PPP) in 2020; low-income countries report the lowest value (4 percent), while other income categories report 7 percent or higher.\nFad diet\n\nFurther information: Fad diet\nSome publicized diets, often referred to as fad diets, make exaggerated claims of fast weight loss or other health advantages, such as longer life or detoxification without clinical evidence; many fad diets are based on highly restrictive or unusual food choices. Celebrity endorsements (including celebrity doctors) are frequently associated with such diets, and the individuals who develop and promote these programs often profit considerably.\n\nPublic health\nMost of the people unable to afford a healthy diet in 2021 lived in southern Asia, and in eastern and western Africa\nConsumers are generally aware of the elements of a healthy diet, but find nutrition labels and diet advice in popular media confusing.\nVending machines are criticized for being avenues of entry into schools for junk food promoters, but there is little in the way of regulation and it is difficult for most people to properly analyze the real merits of a company referring to itself as \"healthy.\" The Committee of Advertising Practice in the United Kingdom launched a proposal to limit media advertising for food and soft drink products high in fat, salt, or sugar. The British Heart Foundation released its own government-funded advertisements, labeled \"Food4Thought\", which were targeted at children and adults to discourage unhealthy habits of consuming junk food.\nFrom a psychological and cultural perspective, a healthier diet may be difficult to achieve for people with poor eating habits. This may be due to tastes acquired in childhood and preferences for sugary, salty, and fatty foods. In 2018, the UK chief medical officer recommended that sugar and salt be taxed to discourage consumption. The UK government 2020 Obesity Strategy encourages healthier choices by restricting point-of-sale promotions of less-healthy foods and drinks.\nThe effectiveness of population-level health interventions has included food pricing strategies, mass media campaigns and worksite wellness programs. One peso per liter of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB) price intervention implemented in Mexico produced a 12% reduction in SSB purchasing. Mass media campaigns in Pakistan and the USA aimed at increasing vegetable and fruit consumption found positive changes in dietary behavior. Reviews of the effectiveness of worksite wellness interventions found evidence linking the programs to weight loss and increased fruit and vegetable consumption.\n\nOther animals\nAnimals that are kept by humans also benefit from a healthy diet, but the requirements of such diets may be very different from the ideal human diet.\n\nSee also\nFood portal\nCommercial determinants of health\nHealthy eating pyramid\nList of diets\nMeals\nNutritionism\nNutrition scale\nNutritional rating systems\nPlanetary Health Diet\nPlant-based diet\nTable of food nutrients"

    "content": "The tapetum lucidum (Latin for 'bright tapestry, coverlet'; /t\u0259\u02c8pi\u02d0t\u0259m \u02c8lu\u02d0s\u026ad\u0259m/ t\u0259-PEE-t\u0259m LOO-sih-d\u0259m; pl.: tapeta lucida) is a layer of tissue in the eye of many vertebrates and some other animals. Lying immediately behind the retina, it is a retroreflector. It reflects visible light back through the retina, increasing the light available to the photoreceptors (although slightly blurring the image). The tapetum lucidum contributes to the superior night vision of some animals. Many of these animals are nocturnal, especially carnivores, while others are deep sea animals.\nSimilar adaptations occur in some species of spiders. Haplorhine primates, including humans, are diurnal and lack a tapetum lucidum.\n\nFunction and mechanism[edit]\nChoroid dissected from a calf's eye, tapetum lucidum appearing iridescent blue\nThe presence of a tapetum lucidum enables animals to see in dimmer light than would otherwise be possible. The tapetum lucidum, which is iridescent, reflects light roughly on the interference principles of thin-film optics, as seen in other iridescent tissues. However, the tapetum lucidum cells are leucophores, not iridophores.\nThe tapetum functions as a retroreflector which reflects light directly back along the light path. This serves to match the original and reflected light, thus maintaining the sharpness and contrast of the image on the retina. The tapetum lucidum reflects with constructive interference, thus increasing the quantity of light passing through the retina. In the cat, the tapetum lucidum increases the sensitivity of vision by 44%, allowing the cat to see light that is imperceptible to human eyes.\nIt has been speculated that some flashlight fish may use eyeshine both to detect and to communicate with other flashlight fish. American scientist Nathan H. Lents has proposed that the tapetum lucidum evolved in vertebrates, but not in cephalopods, which have a very similar eye, because of the backwards-facing nature of vertebrate photoreceptors. The tapetum boosts photosensitivity under conditions of low illumination, thus compensating for the suboptimal design of the vertebrate retina.\n\nClassification[edit]\nA classification of anatomical variants of tapeta lucida defines four types:\nRetinal tapetum, as seen in teleosts (with a variety of reflecting materials from lipids to phenols), crocodiles (with guanine), marsupials (with lipid spheres), and fruit bats (with phospholipids). The tapetum lucidum is within the retinal pigment epithelium; in the other three types the tapetum is within the choroid behind the retina. Two anatomical classes can be distinguished: occlusible and non-occlusible.\nThe brownsnout spookfish has an extraordinary focusing mirror derived from a retinal tapetum.\nChoroidal guainine tapetum, as seen in cartilaginous fish The tapetum is a palisade of cells containing stacks of flat hexagonal crystals of guanine.\nChoroidal tapetum cellulosum, as seen in carnivores, rodents and cetacea. The tapetum consists of layers of cells containing organized, highly refractive crystals. These crystals are diverse in shape and makeup: dogs and ferrets use zinc, cats use riboflavin and zinc, and lemurs use only riboflavin.\nChoroidal tapetum fibrosum, as seen in cows, sheep, goats and horses. The tapetum is an array of extracellular fibers, most commonly collagen.\nThe functional differences between these four structural classes of tapeta lucida are not known.\nThis section is missing information about bird anatomy: are they all retinal? If so, they should be moved up to the 4-type list.. Please expand the section to include this information. Further details may exist on the talk page. (August 2023)\nThis classification does not include tapeta lucida in birds. Kiwis, stone-curlews, the boat-billed heron, the flightless k\u0101k\u0101p\u014d and many nightjars, owls, and other night birds such as the swallow-tailed gull also possess a tapetum lucidum. Nightjars use a retinal tapetum lucidum composed of lipids.\nLike humans, some animals lack a tapetum lucidum and they usually are diurnal. These include haplorhine primates, squirrels, some birds, red kangaroo, and pigs. Strepsirrhine primates are mostly nocturnal and, with the exception of several diurnal Eulemur species, have a tapetum lucidum of riboflavin crystals.\nWhen a tapetum lucidum is present, its location on the eyeball varies with the placement of the eyeball in the head, such that in all cases the tapetum lucidum enhances night vision in the center of the animal's field of view.\nApart from its eyeshine, the tapetum lucidum itself has a color. It is often described as iridescent. In tigers it is greenish. In ruminants it may be golden green with a blue periphery, or whitish or pale blue with a lavender periphery. In dogs it may be whitish with a blue periphery. The color in reindeer changes seasonally, allowing the animals to better avoid predators in low-light winter at the price of blurrier vision.\n\nEyeshine[edit]\nReflection of camera flash from the tapetum lucidum\nEyeshine is a visible effect of the tapetum lucidum. When light shines into the eye of an animal having a tapetum lucidum, the pupil appears to glow. Eyeshine can be seen in many animals, in nature and in flash photographs. In low light, a hand-held flashlight is sufficient to produce eyeshine that is highly visible to humans (despite their inferior night vision). Eyeshine occurs in a wide variety of colors including white, blue, green, yellow, pink and red. However, since eyeshine is a type of iridescence, the color varies with the angle at which it is seen and the minerals which make up the reflective tapetum lucidum crystals.\nWhite eyeshine occurs in many fish, especially walleye; blue eyeshine occurs in many mammals such as horses; green eyeshine occurs in mammals such as cats, dogs, and raccoons; and red eyeshine occurs in coyote, rodents, opossums and birds.\nA three-month-old black Labrador puppy with apparent eyeshine\nAlthough human eyes lack a tapetum lucidum, they still exhibit a weak reflection from the choroid, as can be seen in photography with the red-eye effect and with near-infrared eyeshine. Another effect in humans and other animals that may resemble eyeshine is leukocoria, which is a white shine indicative of abnormalities such as cataracts and cancers.\nIn blue-eyed cats and dogs[edit]\n\nThis section does not cite any sources.

Both species have a tapetum lucidum, so their pupils may display eyeshine. In flash color photographs, however, individuals with blue eyes may also display a distinctive red eyeshine. Individuals with heterochromia may display red eyeshine in the blue eye and normal yellow/green/blue/white eyeshine in the other eye. These include odd-eyed cats and bi-eyed dogs. The red-eye effect is independent of the eyeshine: in some photographs of individuals with a tapetum lucidum and heterochromia, the eyeshine is dim, yet the pupil of the blue eye still appears red. This is most apparent when the individual is not looking into the camera because the tapetum lucidum is far less extensive than the retina.\nIn spiders[edit]\nMost species of spider also have a tapetum, which is located only in their smaller, lateral eyes; the larger central eyes have no such structure. This consists of reflective crystalline deposits, and is thought to have a similar function to the structure of the same name in vertebrates. Four general patterns can be distinguished in spiders:\nPrimitive type (e.g. Mesothelae, Orthognatha)\u00a0\u2013 a simple sheet behind the retina\nCanoe-shape type (e.g. Araneidae, Theridiidae)\u00a0\u2013 two lateral walls separated by a gap for the nerve fibres\nGrated type (e.g. Lycosidae, Pisauridae)\u00a0\u2013 a relatively complex, grill-shaped structure\nNo tapetum (e.g. Salticidae)\nUses by humans[edit]\nIn darkness, eyeshine reveals this raccoon\nHumans use scanning for reflected eyeshine to detect and identify the species of animals in the dark, and deploying trained search dogs and search horses at night, as these animals benefit from improved night vision through this effect.\nUsing eyeshine to identify animals in the dark employs not only its color but also several other features. The color corresponds approximately to the type of tapetum lucidum, with some variation between species. Other features include the distance between pupils relative to their size; the height above ground; the manner of blinking (if any); and the movement of the eyeshine (bobbing, weaving, hopping, leaping, climbing, flying).\n\nArtificial tapetum lucidum[edit]\nManufactured retroreflectors modeled after a tapetum lucidum are described in numerous patents and today have many uses. The earliest patent, first used in \"Catseye\" brand raised pavement markers, was inspired by the tapetum lucidum of a cat's eye.\n\nPathology[edit]\nIn dogs, certain drugs are known to disturb the precise organization of the crystals of the tapetum lucidum, thus compromising the dog's ability to see in low light. These drugs include ethambutol, macrolide antibiotics, dithizone, antimalarial medications, some receptor H2-antagonists, and cardiovascular agents. The disturbance \"is attributed to the chelating action which removes zinc from the tapetal cells.\"\n\nGallery[edit]\nTraditionally it has been difficult to take retinal images of animals with a tapetum lucidum because ophthalmoscopy devices designed for humans rely on a high level of on-axis illumination. This kind of illumination causes a great deal of reflex, or back-scatter, when it interacts with the tapetum. New devices with variable illumination can make this possible, however.\nHeterochromatic dog with red-eye effect in blue eye\n\n\n\nAye-aye\n\n\n\nSportive lemur\n\n\n\nReflective eyes of a cat visible from a camera flash\n\n\n\nA domestic tabby cat's green tapetum lucidum, apparent with camera flash\n\n\n\nEuropean nightjar\n\n\n\nSubway passengers photographed with camera flash on small camera\n\nSee also[edit]\nDefense mechanism (biology)\nEmission theory (vision)\nNocturnal bottleneck\nWalleye\n\nNotes[edit]\n^ The one exception to this generalization is the neotropical night monkey genus Aotus; they are sometimes described as having a tapetum lucidum of collagen fibrils, but lack the reflective riboflavin crystals present in the eyes of nocturnal strepsirrhine primates."

As we know from ancient times, the eyes are the mirror of the soul.\nAnd it is whether or not you can take an amazing picture of a person's eyes\nthat the portrait will turn out.\n\nCertain subtleties can help you make a beautiful photo, where the soul and\nmood of the model will be expressed to the fullest extent. In our tutorial, we\nwill show you how to take a photo of your eyes correctly.\n\n##  Light for Macro Pictures of Eyes\n\nEyes look best when they are well-lit with beautiful highlights. Glare is the\nreflection of the light source in your eyes. The size, shape, and brightness\nof the glare depend on the catchlights you are using. Two large frosted\nwindows from the studio create beautiful glare. A diffused flash on your\ncamera creates a softer rectangular reflected glare. A medium-sized softbox\npositioned off-camera at 2 o'clock gives a soft, natural glare. Poorly lit\neyeball photography without glare looks cold and a little creepy.\n\nIn addition to glare, you can capture various reflections in the model's eyes.\nThis is a great way to give portraits a certain artistic atmosphere. There are\nmany options - you can capture another person, an object, or even a landscape.\nCapturing reflections can be especially interesting in close-up eyes\nphotography \u2013 try experimenting with it!\n\nAvoid the red-eye effect. Red-eye in  portrait photography  is a common red-\neye phenomenon in flash photography, and it happens when the flash is get too\nclose to the camera. This effect is easily avoided by following a few\nphotography eye close-up tips:\n\n  * Remove the flash from the camera. Use only remote on-camera flashes; \n  * Reflect the flash off the ceiling or walls; \n  * Use special diffusers and reflectors; \n  * Use a light disk to diffuse the light from the flash; \n  * Turn on the camera's red-eye reduction mode; \n  * If nothing helps, red-eye can be removed during post-processing as a last resort. \n\n##  Camera Settings for Eye Macro Photography\n\nUse the zoom to bring the eye in the frame closer. Adjust the zoom to get\nexactly the frame you want. If you widen the frame to include additional\ndetails, it can provide the photo with additional context. However, it can\nshift the focus away from the subject you originally wanted to photograph.\nEnsure that the camera is stationary by placing it on a tripod or other secure\nsurface. When shooting at close range, the slightest shake of the hand can\nblur the picture. Using a tripod or shooting from a stationary surface that\nwill support the camera will help prevent blur. Consider using a macro ring\nthat reduces the focal length of the lens. The macro ring is mounted between\nthe camera body and the back of the lens. Using the macro ring allows you to\nzoom in on the eye in the frame, thereby capturing more detail.\n\nAttach a macro lens to your camera. A macro lens will allow you to capture the\neye in the most detail. Macro lenses range in focal length from 50 mm to 200\nmm. Of course, you can find a perfect moment to shoot off the eye with a\nnormal lens but it won't fill the entire frame and be as detailed as you want\nit to be.\n\nIf you don't have a macro lens and don't want to spend the money to buy one,\ntry using a magnifying filter as an alternative.\n\nReduce the  camera aperture  to increase the depth of field. Close-up shots\nlook better with good sharpness. Reduce the aperture from f/5.6 to f/11.\n\nThe specific aperture value will depend on what kind of eye detail you want to\nemphasize in your photo. Experiment with the aperture to see how different\nsettings affect the frame. Now that you know direct camera settings let's talk\nabout how to take good pictures of your eyes.\n\n##  How to Do Beautiful Eye Macro Photography?\n\nLet's start with the secrets that almost everyone knows. In bright light, the\npupils narrow, but in dim light or a special mood, they dilate, and you can\nget an incredibly beautiful shot with \"open\" pupils. So you don't want to use\na flash. Experiment with natural light and auxiliary permanent sources, which\nwill help you create a correct and beautiful light pattern. While directing\nthe light, make sure not to direct it clearly into the wrinkles in the corners\nof the eyes - such an effect will not be appreciated in the finished photo.\nNow its time for a few other tips and eyes photography ideas:\n\n  * When you try several different light sources, keep in mind that the process can take a long time, because the color temperature of the eyes will change, depending on the lighting. \n  * It's no secret that human eyes are asymmetrical. There is a secret among photographers - to focus on one eye, so the photo will be more interesting making your model's gaze will attract the viewer's eye. \n  * An interesting trick is to take a photo of the look of your eyes photography with.... an object reflected in them. Place the light source, and the object that you think is most relevant and appropriate in front of the model. The photo will turn out magical and will arouse the viewer's interest. \n  * Another trick is macro photography of eyes. You will need a special camera or rings of attachments for macro, and also a quiet model who will not mind a long process. You will need to arrange a comfortable place for her to work, where she will be comfortable and quiet for a long time. \n  * Be sure to give the model a rest, as long, uninterrupted staring into the camera will make your eyes water and, of course, can be uncomfortable. So you need time for a short break, which will allow the model to recover. \n  * To make the eyes close-up photography session more comfortable, try advising the model to blink or use eye drops before each new shot. \n  * Use a slower shutter speed to avoid blurring the frame. The eye is constantly moving, which may result in a blurred image. To get a sharp image, need to adjust the  shutter speed  to 1/100th of a second or faster. \n  * Using a tripod will also allow you to use a shorter shutter speed. \n  * Reduce the ISO setting to avoid digital graininess. Increasing the ISO setting allows you to take photos when subjects are poorly lit, but the photos will become grainy. If you are taking photos in good light, keep the ISO setting to the lowest acceptable level. Manually adjust the focus. Autofocus may not focus the lens exactly on the details of the eye you want to capture, so it is best to turn it off and focus manually. To adjust the focus yourself, rotate the lens focus ring until the frame is completely blurred. Then start twisting it back until the parts you want to capture are in focus. \n\nNow, that you know how to take eye pictures, let's talk about another aspect\nof this case.\n\n###  Close-Up Filters\n\nClose-up filters are filters for close-ups. Their action can be compared to\nthat of a magnifying glass. They scale the object, but the quality of the\nimage is somewhat reduced, as well as the amount of light entering the lens.\nFilters are inexpensive and are good for fun experiments if you don't have a\nmacro lens. There is a gradation for them: +1, +2, +5, and so on, the higher\nthe number, the stronger the filters magnify, and the less light hits the\nsensors.\n\n###  What Will Be Required of the Model?\n\nOf course, not everything during the shoot is up to the photographer. How to\ntake eyes photography from the model side? The model will need to take care of\nher eyes the day before the shoot. Not to spend sleepless nights or attend\nnoisy parties on the eve of the photo session. The model should get a good\nrest, and gain strength. If the sleep is not good and prolonged - you'll get\non the photo yellowish whites, maybe even with red streaks, which absolutely\nwill not be too attractive. Of course, if the idea of the photo session is not\nto capture a tired person. In other cases let your eyes rest. It is very\nimportant to give instructions on sleep and rest regimens before taking an\neyes portrait photography session.\n\nOf course, such advice may seem optional, as yellowish whites can be easily\ncorrected during  photo retouching  . But the mood and the inner state of the\nmodel during the shooting cannot be corrected so easily.\n\nToday we have learned what you can do to make the model's eyes more expressive\nand express her soul.\n\n###  Post-Processing\n\nPost-processing is very important in photography eyes. You can take your\nportrait photo from just good to the best. The key to great post-processing is\nnot to overdo it.\n\nIt's easy to enjoy all the tricks and enhancements that post-production\nsoftware offers. When it comes to retouching, the photographer tries to use\nthe night rule. After Gina has worked on an image, she won't look at it again,\nat least not during the day. More often than not, you find that your eyes are\nconstantly adapting to the modifications you make, so it becomes harder to see\nwhen you've gone too far.\n\n##  Edit Your Macro Shots of Eyes in Luminar Neo\n\nNow that you know how to take a picture of your eye, let's talk about how to\nimprove it!\n\nThe powerful  photo editor  Luminar Neo provides a great way to add surreal or\nfantastical elements to your macro-eye sharp images!

Earlier estimates of extinction rates have been criticized for using assumptions that might overestimate the severity of the extinction crisis. We assess, using extremely conservative assumptions, whether human activities are causing a mass extinction. First, we use a recent estimate of a background rate of 2 mammal extinctions per 10,000 species per 100 years (that is, 2 E/MSY), which is twice as high as widely used previous estimates. We then compare this rate with the current rate of mammal and vertebrate extinctions. The latter is conservatively low because listing a species as extinct requires meeting stringent criteria. Even under our assumptions, which would tend to minimize evidence of an incipient mass extinction, the average rate of vertebrate species loss over the last century is up to 100 times higher than the background rate. Under the 2 E/MSY background rate, the number of species that have gone extinct in the last century would have taken, depending on the vertebrate taxon, between 800 and 10,000 years to disappear. These estimates reveal an exceptionally rapid loss of biodiversity over the last few centuries, indicating that a sixth mass extinction is already under way. Averting a dramatic decay of biodiversity and the subsequent loss of ecosystem services is still possible through intensified conservation efforts, but that window of opportunity is rapidly closing.\nSIGN UP FOR THE SCIENCE ADVANCES eTOC\nGet the latest table of contents from Science Advances delivered right to you!\nINTRODUCTION\nThe loss of biodiversity is one of the most critical current environmental problems, threatening valuable ecosystem services and human well-being (1\u20137). A growing body of evidence indicates that current species extinction rates are higher than the pre-human background rate (8\u201315), with hundreds of anthropogenic vertebrate extinctions documented in prehistoric and historic times (16\u201323). For example, in the islands of tropical Oceania, up to 1800 bird species (most described in the last few decades from subfossil remains) are estimated to have gone extinct in the ~2000 years since human colonization (24). Written records of extinctions of large mammals, birds, and reptiles date back to the 1600s and include species such as the dodo (Raphus cucullatus, extinguished in the 17th century), Steller\u2019s sea cow (Hydrodamalis gigas, extinguished in the 18th century), and the Rodrigues giant tortoise (Cylindraspis peltastes, extinguished in the 19th century). More species extinction records date from the 19th century and include numerous species of mammals and birds. Records of extinction for reptiles, amphibians, freshwater fishes, and other organisms have mainly been documented since the beginning of the 20th century (14, 17). Moreover, even in species that are not currently threatened, the extirpation of populations is frequent and widespread, with losses that far outstrip species-level extinctions (18, 25). Population-level extinction directly threatens ecosystem services and is the prelude to species-level extinction (18).\nHere, we analyze the modern rates of vertebrate species extinction and compare them with a recently computed background rate for mammals (7). We specifically addressed the following questions: (i) Are modern rates of mammal and vertebrate extinctions higher than the highest empirically derived background rates? (ii) How have modern extinction rates in mammals and vertebrates changed through time? (iii) How many years would it have taken for species that went extinct in modern times to have been lost if the background rate had prevailed? These are important issues because the uncertainties about estimates of species loss have led skeptics to question the magnitude of anthropogenic extinctions (26) and because understanding the magnitude of the extinction crisis is relevant for conservation, maintenance of ecosystem services, and public policy.\nUntil recently, most studies of modern extinction rates have been based on indirect estimates derived, for example, on the rates of deforestation and on species-area relationships (11, 14). Problems related to estimating extinction since 1500 AD (that is, modern extinctions) have been widely discussed, and the literature reflects broad agreement among environmental scientists that biases lead to underestimating the number of species that have gone extinct in the past few centuries\u2014the period during which Homo sapiens truly became a major force on the biosphere (1\u20134, 6\u20138, 14, 15). However, direct evaluation is complicated by uncertainties in estimating the incidence of extinction in historical time and by methodological difficulties in comparing contemporary extinctions with past ones.\nLess discussed are assumptions underlying the estimation of background extinction rates. The lower these estimates, the more dramatic current extinction rates will appear by comparison. In nearly all comparisons of modern versus background extinction rates, the background rate has been assumed to be somewhere between 0.1 and 1 species extinction per 10,000 species per 100 years (equal to 0.1 to 1 species extinction per million species per year, a widely used metric known as E/MSY). Those estimates reflect the state of knowledge available from the fossil record in the 1990s (7, 9\u201313). In a recent analysis, which charted the stratigraphic ranges of thousands of mammal species, extinction rates were measured over intervals ranging from single years to millions of years, and the mean extinction rate and variance were computed for each span of time (7). In this way, the background extinction rate estimated for mammals was estimated at 1.8 E/MSY, here rounded upward conservatively to 2 E/MSY (that is, 2 extinctions per 100 years per 10,000 species). This is double the highest previous rough estimate.\nThose previously estimated background rates were primarily derived from marine invertebrate fossils, which are likely to have greater species longevity than vertebrates (10, 15). Data deficiencies make it impossible to conduct empirical analyses (as was done for mammals) for non-mammal terrestrial vertebrates; therefore, we assume the background rates of other vertebrates to be similar to those of mammals. This supposition leads to a more conservative assessment of differences between current and past extinction rates for the vertebrates as a whole, compared with using the very low background extinction rate derived from marine invertebrates.\nThe analysis we present here avoids using assumptions such as loss of species predicted from species-area relationships, which can suggest very high extinction rates, and which have raised the possibility that scientists are \u201calarmists\u201d seeking to exaggerate the impact of humans on the biosphere (26). Here, we ascertain whether even the lowest estimates of the difference between background and contemporary extinction rates still justify the conclusion that people are precipitating a global spasm of biodiversity loss.\nRESULTS\nModern and background rates of vertebrate extinctions\nModern rates of vertebrate extinction were much higher than a background extinction rate of 2 E/MSY. Among the vertebrate taxa evaluated by the International Union of Conservation of Nature (IUCN), 338 extinctions have been documented since 1500 [\u201cextinct\u201d (EX), Table 1]. An additional 279 species have become either \u201cextinct in the wild\u201d (EW) or listed as \u201cpossibly extinct\u201d (PE), totaling 617 vertebrate species summed over the three categories. Most extinctions have occurred in the last 114 years (that is, since 1900; Table 1). Our estimated \u201chighly conservative\u201d (that is, using data for EX species only) and \u201cconservative\u201d (that is, by including EX, EW, and PE) modern extinction rates for vertebrates varied from 8 to 100 times higher than the background rate (Table 2). This means, for example, that under the 2 E/MSY background rate, 9 vertebrate extinctions would have been expected since 1900; however, under the conservative rate, 468 more vertebrates have gone extinct than would have if the background rate had persisted across all vertebrates under that period.

For example, amphibians, comprising of ~7300 species, show an accelerating rate of extinction: only 34 extinctions have been documented with a high level of certainty since 1500, yet >100 species have likely disappeared since 1980 (17, 23). This may not only reflect real trends but also a shortage of data for groups for which most species are not yet evaluated, such as reptiles and fish (21, 22).\n\nFig. 1 Cumulative vertebrate species recorded as extinct or extinct in the wild by the IUCN (2012).\nGraphs show the percentage of the number of species evaluated among mammals (5513; 100% of those described), birds (10,425; 100%), reptiles (4414; 44%), amphibians (6414; 88%), fishes (12,457; 38%), and all vertebrates combined (39,223; 59%). Dashed black curve represents the number of extinctions expected under a constant standard background rate of 2 E/MSY. (A) Highly conservative estimate. (B) Conservative estimate.\nModern extinctions if background rate had prevailed\nOur results indicate that modern vertebrate extinctions that occurred since 1500 and 1900 AD would have taken several millennia to occur if the background rate had prevailed. The total number of vertebrate species that went extinct in the last century would have taken about 800 to 10,000 years to disappear under the background rate of 2 E/MSY (Fig. 2). The particularly high losses in the last several decades accentuate the increasing severity of the modern extinction crisis.\n\nFig. 2 Number of years that would have been required for the observed vertebrate species extinctions in the last 114 years to occur under a background rate of 2 E/MSY.\nRed markers, highly conservative scenario; blue markers, conservative scenario. Note that for all vertebrates, the observed extinctions would have taken between 800 to 10,000 years to disappear, assuming 2 E/MSY. Different classes of vertebrates all show qualitatively similar trends.\nDISCUSSION\nArguably the most serious aspect of the environmental crisis is the loss of biodiversity\u2014the other living things with which we share Earth. This affects human well-being by interfering with crucial ecosystem services such as crop pollination and water purification and by destroying humanity\u2019s beautiful, fascinating, and culturally important living companions (4, 5, 15, 27\u201330).\nOur analysis shows that current extinction rates vastly exceed natural average background rates, even when (i) the background rate is considered to be double previous estimates and when (ii) data on modern vertebrate extinctions are treated in the most conservative plausible way. We emphasize that our calculations very likely underestimate the severity of the extinction crisis because our aim was to place a realistic \u201clower bound\u201d on humanity\u2019s impact on biodiversity. Therefore, although biologists cannot say precisely how many species there are, or exactly how many have gone extinct in any time interval, we can confidently conclude that modern extinction rates are exceptionally high, that they are increasing, and that they suggest a mass extinction under way\u2014the sixth of its kind in Earth\u2019s 4.5 billion years of history.\nA final important point is that we focus exclusively on species, ignoring the extirpation of populations\u2014the units relevant to ecological functioning and the delivery of ecosystem services (4, 5, 29). Population extinction cannot be reliably assessed from the fossil record, precluding any analysis along the lines of that presented here. Also, although it is clear that there are high rates of population extinction (18), existing data are much less reliable and far harder to obtain than those for species, which will remain true for the foreseeable future. Likewise, we have not considered animals other than vertebrates because of data deficiencies.\nThe evidence is incontrovertible that recent extinction rates are unprecedented in human history and highly unusual in Earth\u2019s history. Our analysis emphasizes that our global society has started to destroy species of other organisms at an accelerating rate, initiating a mass extinction episode unparalleled for 65 million years. If the currently elevated extinction pace is allowed to continue, humans will soon (in as little as three human lifetimes) be deprived of many biodiversity benefits. On human time scales, this loss would be effectively permanent because in the aftermath of past mass extinctions, the living world took hundreds of thousands to millions of years to rediversify. Avoiding a true sixth mass extinction will require rapid, greatly intensified efforts to conserve already threatened species and to alleviate pressures on their populations\u2014notably habitat loss, overexploitation for economic gain, and climate change (31\u201333). All of these are related to human population size and growth, which increases consumption (especially among the rich), and economic inequity (6). However, the window of opportunity is rapidly closing.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nTo estimate modern extinction rates, we compiled data on the total number of described species and the number of extinct and possibly extinct vertebrate species from the 2014 IUCN Red List (17). In the IUCN\u2019s list, extinct species can be viewed as the minimum number of actual extinctions during recent human history (that is, since 1500) because it lists species known to be extinct (EX), extinct in the wild (EW), and possibly extinct (PE, a subcategory within \u201ccritically endangered\u201d reserved for species thought to be extinct, but not confirmed) (17) (table S1). We used the IUCN data to calculate modern extinction rates in two ways: (i) we estimate a \u201chighly conservative modern extinction rate\u201d by using the data exclusively on species listed as EX, and (ii) we calculate a \u201cconservative extinction rate\u201d by including also both EW and PE species (table S2). Including these latter two categories recognizes that there is only a slim chance that most of the species in those categories can reestablish viable populations in their native habitats. In terms of biological impact and the provision of ecosystem services, we consider EW and PE species to be functionally equivalent to EX species: even if some individuals still exist, their abundances are not sufficient to have a substantial influence on ecological function and processes.\nThe IUCN\u2019s list is considered the authoritative, albeit likely conservative, assessment of the conservation status of plant and animal species. About 1.8 million species have been described since 1758 (when the current nomenclature system was developed), of which 1.3 million are animals (3, 17). Of these animal species, about 39,223 (of the currently counted 66,178) vertebrate species have been formally assessed and reported in the 2014 IUCN Red List (17). In the IUCN sample, mammals, birds, and amphibians have had between 88 and 100% of their known species evaluated, whereas only 44% of reptiles and 38% of fish species have been assessed (Table 1). We focus our comparisons on vertebrates because they are the group for which the most reliable data exist, both fossil and modern.\nTo produce conservative comparisons with modern extinctions, we assumed a background extinction rate of 2 E/MSY as the highest likely baseline average background extinction rate (7); that is, we should expect 2 extinctions per 10,000 vertebrate species per 100 years. That background extinction rate was empirically determined using the exceptionally good fossil records of mammals, combining extinction counts from paleontological databases and published literature on the fossil, subfossil, and historical records (7). Using the resulting high background extinction rate provides a stringent test for assessing whether current modern extinction rates indicate that a mass extinction event is under way. Previous estimates of background extinction rates for other taxa are invariably lower than the mammal-derived estimate of 2 E/MSY used here.\nAcknowledgments\nWe would like to thank B.

BRIGGS Professor Emeritus Department of Fisheries and Wildlife, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR 97333, USA\nIs a Sixth Global Mass Extinction Underway?\n\nJohn C. Briggs*\nIn their recent article, published in Sciences Advances, Ceballos et al. (19 June 2015) endeavored to demonstrate that species extinctions by humans have caused the world to enter into its sixth mass extinction. As evidence, they compared extinction rates, among terrestrial vertebrates for the past few centuries, to the historical rate from the geological record. However, the historical rate was calculated only from data on mammal extinctions. The authors assumed that the historical mammal rate could be applied to all the other vertebrates (birds, reptiles, amphibians, and fishes). Using the mammal data, the authors determined that, without human influence, only nine vertebrate extinctions would have been expected since the year 1900.\nAccording to the Red List (IUCN, 2014), 198 extinctions were recorded for all terrestrial vertebrates since the year 1900. Compared to the expected nine extinctions during that time (Caballos et al., 2015), an increase of 189 appears to indicate a disastrous human influence. Extending back to the year 1500, a total of 338 were documented by the Red List. In addition to these numbers, the authors recognized 279 more species under \"extinct in the wild\" and \"possibly extinct\" categories. These figures produced a grand total 617 vertebrate species lost or presumed lost since 1500. These impressive numbers persuaded the authors to declare that the evidence is \"incontrovertible\", that the recent extinction rates are unprecedented, and that the rate is highly unusual in Earth history. Therefore, they concluded that a mass extinction episode had been initiated.\nThe unfortunate aspect of this work is that no reference was made to other estimates of global extinctions using other faunal groups. Extinctions recorded in the marine environment were not considered, and no mention was made about concurrent gains in species diversity. About 90% of the terrestrial world's species are insects. A recent estimate by an entomologist (Dunn, 2005) indicates a species diversity of about 3.4 million. While many insect species are still undescribed, certain groups, (butterflies, tiger beetles, dragonflies, and damselflies) are well known and their extinctions during the past 500 years have been documented. Within those groups, which total 25,260 species, only two species have become extinct (Briggs, 2014). In the marine environment, which covers about 71% of the Earth's surface, the diversity of multicellular species is about 2.21 million (Mora et al., 2011); of this number, only 20 have been recorded to be extinct (Dulvy et al., 2009). Furthermore, a recent, uncited paleontological work on extinctions (MacLeod, 2013) provides valuable information on Pleistocene and modern extinction rates. Finally, there is good evidence that points to continual gains in diversity due to species invasions and rapid ecological speciation (Briggs, 2014).\nAside from the neglect of the published information cited above, the attempt to forecast a global extinction on the basis of only terrestrial vertebrate animals (Ceballos et al., 2015), is unconvincing when comparable information on other faunal groups is not utilized. Also, in dealing with the numbers of vertebrate extinctions, the authors failed to mention that most of them took place on oceanic islands. In regard to the mammals and birds, more than 95% of all extinctions during the past 500 years were island species (Loehle and Eschenbach, 2012). If we use the mammals and birds as surrogates for all the vertebrates, extinctions on the world's continents must have been very low. For example, only three of the 61 mammal extinctions took place on continents. The loss of isolated island species had little or no effect on continental ecology.\nThis is the latest in a series of books and papers, published over the past 40 years, devoted to the frightening vision of a human-caused mass extinction. Its use of colorful graphs, showing vertebrate species dying off by the hundreds, presents a doomsday scenario that many are likely to believe, unless they consider the global extinction evidence.\nReferences\nBriggs, J.C.

This is suggested in the present study by Ceballos et al. where they attempted to identify the next mass extinction. The pace at which species are getting extinct is alarming. Though there were reports earlier about the high rate of extinction of species in post industrialization era, yet lack of conclusive parameters and estimates always diluted the effect it should have on the policy makers and public. Comparison of \"highly conservative modern extinction rate\" and \"background extinction rate\" in this study provides a clear picture of rapid extinction of species. Man's consumerist approach has been responsible for bringing on the possibility of sixth mass extinction that could very well have been avoided by adopting small measures in light of knowledge of ecology and modern science.\nVarious anthropogenic factors like deforestation, aggressive exploitation of natural resources, mining and mindless dumping toxic wastes in natural environment may have plausible role for massive extinction. While we are trying to explore life on other planets, forgetting to concentrate to take measures to save our own planet. Man has lost the touch with nature and has become oblivious of his role of just a co-habitant on Earth not its master. Small steps like supporting the local animals and birds and separating solid wastes can go a long way in this direction. If we learn to appreciate the role of biodiversity for our well being, progress and future survival and found ways to nurture and conserve it in a sustainable manner, we can at least delay the mass extinction if not avoid it.\nConsortium development and effective data collection and further analysis will lead to more awareness about the issue and conservation at global scale.\n\nJUN. 22, 2015\nRE: Accelerated modern human\u2013induced species losses: Entering the sixth mass extinction\nTHOMAS CROFT Youth sports coordinator. PSA\nThe article brings some interesting statistics showing the increase rate of extinctions among mammal and vertebrate. The over population of humans is obviously a great problem and has been for years. The population of humans in the early 1960s was around 3 billion and today over 7 billion and projected to be around 10 billion by 2020. No matter what mankind does that kind of overpopulation will put a stress on earth's ecosystems and animals and bio-systems. I remember scientists in the 1970s warning of overpopulation.. it is the fundamental basis for all the environmental problems. This article, if the stats are correct, bring this more to light.\nHowever this article's very important point looses credibility with statements like: \"All of these are related to human population size and growth, which increases consumption (especially among the rich), and economic inequity\". Over population increases consumption - period. Consumption of resources is world wide and is effected by population increases world wide, not just the rich ( and I assume you meant rich countries). And population increases are happening more rapidly in the less \"rich\" countries. \"Overexploitation for economic gain\" is minor compared to just the sheer volume of people living on the earth that consume air and food and resources and create waste. The destruction of the rain forest in South America since the 1940s to make cheap farming land for the poor has probably done as much damage to species extinction as other factors. That rain forest is huge role in photosynthesis as well as maintaining millions of animal lives.\nWhile this article is important in its statistics on animal extinctions, it barely touches on how the loss directly is caused by man or effects man or any solutions (which I understand that is not what this article was for). The article ended sounding of some sort of opinionated agenda which lessen its scientific credibility. Still very important.\n\nJUN. 19, 2015\nRE: Figure 2 legend reversed?\nKENNETH DANIEL HOOPER Electrical Engineer\nPossibly it is my lack of understanding, but should the MORE conservative figure result in a smaller equivalent time to extinction?\n\nLooking at Table S2 \"1900 to 2014 Highly Conservative\" F/E for Amphibians (for example) shows '22'\nLooking at Table S2 \"1900 to 2014 Conservative\" F/E for Amphibians shows '100'.\n\nThis is reversed from Figure 2, which shows \"Very Conservative\" for Amphibians at 10,000 years and \"Conservative\" for Amphibians at 2,200 years.\n\nRecommended articles from TrendMD\nCollapse of the world\u2019s largest herbivores\nWilliam J.

    "content": "\nThe treeshrews (also called tree shrews or banxrings) are small mammals native to the tropical forests of South and Southeast Asia. They make up the entire order Scandentia, which split into two families: the Tupaiidae (19 species, \"ordinary\" treeshrews), and the Ptilocercidae (one species, the pen-tailed treeshrew).\nThough called 'treeshrews', and despite having previously been classified in Insectivora, they are not true shrews, and not all species live in trees. They are omnivores; among other things, treeshrews eat fruit.\nTreeshrews have a higher brain to body mass ratio than any other mammal, including humans, but high ratios are not uncommon for animals weighing less than 1\u00a0kg (2\u00a0lb).\nAmong orders of mammals, treeshrews are closely related to primates, and have been used as an alternative to primates in experimental studies of myopia, psychosocial stress, and hepatitis.\n\nName[edit]\nThe name Tupaia is derived from tupai, the Malay word for squirrel, and was provided by Sir Stamford Raffles.\n\nDescription[edit]\nDentition of Tupaia\nMadras treeshrew (Anathana ellioti)\nNorthern smooth-tailed treeshrew (Dendrogale murina)\nNorthern treeshrew (Tupaia belangeri)\nCommon treeshrew (T. glis)\nHorsfield's treeshrew (T. javanica)\nPygmy treeshrew (T. minor)\nPen-tailed treeshrew (1850 depiction of Ptilocercus lowii)\nTreeshrews are slender animals with long tails and soft, greyish to reddish-brown fur. The terrestrial species tend to be larger than the arboreal forms, and to have larger claws, which they use for digging up insect prey. They have poorly developed canine teeth and unspecialised molars, with an overall dental formula of 2.1.3.33.1.3.3\nTreeshrews have good vision, which is binocular in the case of the more arboreal species.\n\nReproduction[edit]\nFemale treeshrews have a gestation period of 45\u201350\u00a0days and give birth to up to three young in nests lined with dry leaves inside tree hollows. The young are born blind and hairless, but are able to leave the nest after about a month. During this period, the mother provides relatively little maternal care, visiting her young only for a few minutes every other day to suckle them.\nTreeshrews reach sexual maturity after around four months, and breed for much of the year, with no clear breeding season in most species.\n\nBehavior[edit]\nTreeshrews live in small family groups, which defend their territory from intruders. Most are diurnal, although the pen-tailed treeshrew is nocturnal.\nThey mark their territories using various scent glands or urine, depending on the particular species.\n\nDiet[edit]\nTreeshrews are omnivorous, feeding on insects, small vertebrates, fruit, and seeds. Among other things, treeshrews eat Rafflesia fruit.\nThe pen-tailed treeshrew in Malaysia is able to consume large amounts of naturally fermented nectar from flower buds of the bertam palm Eugeissona tristis (with up to 3.8% alcohol content) the entire year without it having any effects on behaviour.\nTreeshrews have also been observed intentionally eating foods high in capsaicin, a behavior unique among mammals other than humans.  A single TRPV1 mutation reduces their pain response to capsaicinoids, which scientists believe is an evolutionary adaptation to be able to consume spicy foods in their natural habitats.\n\nTaxonomy[edit]\nThey make up the entire order Scandentia, split into the families Tupaiidae, the treeshrews, and Ptilocercidae, the pen-tailed treeshrew. The 20\u00a0species are placed in five genera.\nTreeshrews were moved from the order Insectivora into the order Primates because of certain internal similarities to primates (for example, similarities in the brain anatomy, highlighted by Sir Wilfrid Le Gros Clark), and classified as a \"primitive prosimian\", however they were soon split from the primates and moved into their own clade. Taxonomists continue to refine the treeshrews' relations to primates and to other closely related clades.\nMolecular phylogenetic studies have suggested that the treeshrews should be given the same rank (order) as the primates and, with the primates and the flying lemurs (colugos), belong to the grandorder Euarchonta. According to this classification, the Euarchonta are sister to the Glires (lagomorphs and rodents), and the two groups are combined into the superorder Euarchontoglires. However, the alternative placement of treeshrews as sister to both Glires and Primatomorpha cannot be ruled out. Some studies place Scandentia as sister of the Glires, which would invalidate Euarchonta: It is this organization that is shown in the tree diagram below.\nEuarchontoglires\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScandentia (treeshrews)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlires\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLagomorpha (rabbits, hares, pikas)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRodentia (rodents)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrimatomorpha\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDermoptera (Colugos)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2020Plesiadapiformes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrimates\nSeveral other arrangements of these orders have been proposed in the past, and the above tree is only a well-favored proposal. Although it is known that Scandentia is one of the most basal Euarchontoglire clades, the exact phylogenetic position is not yet considered resolved: It may be a sister of Glires, Primatomorpha, or Dermoptera, or separate from and sister to all other Euarchontoglires. Shared short interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs) offer strong evidence for scandentia belonging to the euarchonta group:\n\nEuarchontoglires\n\n\n\n\n\nGlires\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLagomorpha (rabbits, hares, pikas)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRodentia (rodents)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEuarchonta\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScandentia (treeshrews)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrimatomorpha\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDermoptera (colugos)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrimates (\u2020Plesiadapiformes, Strepsirrhini, Haplorrhini)\nOrder Scandentia[edit]\nMain article: List of scandentians\nThe 23\u00a0species are placed in four genera, which are divided into two families. The majority are in the \"ordinary\" treeshrew family, Tupaiidae, but one species, the pen-tailed treeshrew, is different enough to warrant placement in its own family, Ptilocercidae; the two families are thought to have separated 60 million years ago. The former Tupaiidae genus Urogale was disbanded in 2011 when the Mindanao treeshrew was moved to Tupaia based on a molecular phylogeny.\nFamily Tupaiidae\nGenus Anathana\nMadras treeshrew, A. ellioti\nGenus Dendrogale\nBornean smooth-tailed treeshrew, D. melanura\nNorthern smooth-tailed treeshrew, D. murina\nGenus Tupaia\nNorthern treeshrew, T. belangeri\nGolden-bellied treeshrew, T. chrysogaster\nBangka Island treeshrew, T. discolor\nStriped treeshrew, T. dorsalis\nMindanao treeshrew, T. everetti\nSumatran treeshrew, T. ferruginea\nCommon treeshrew, T. glis\nSlender treeshrew, T. gracilis\nJavan treeshrew, T. hypochrysa\nHorsfield's treeshrew, T. javanica\nLong-footed treeshrew, T. longipes\nPygmy treeshrew, T. minor\nMountain treeshrew, T. montana\nNicobar treeshrew, T. nicobarica\nPalawan treeshrew, T. palawanensis\nPainted treeshrew, T. picta\nKalimantan treeshrew, T. salatana\nRuddy treeshrew, T. splendidula\nLarge treeshrew, T. tana\nFamily Ptilocercidae\nGenus Ptilocercus\nPen-tailed treeshrew, P. lowii\n\nFossil record[edit]\nThe fossil record of treeshrews is poor. The oldest putative treeshrew, Eodendrogale parva, is from the Middle Eocene of Henan, China, but the identity of this animal is uncertain. Other fossils have come from the Miocene of Thailand, Pakistan, India, and Yunnan, China, as well as the Pliocene of India. Most belong to the family Tupaiidae; one fossil species described from the Oligocene of Yunnan is thought to be closer to the pen-tailed treeshrew.\nNamed fossil species include Prodendrogale yunnanica, Prodendrogale engesseri, and Tupaia storchi from Yunnan, Tupaia miocenica from Thailand, Palaeotupaia sivalicus from India and Ptilocercus kylin from Yunnan."

Some reasons, such as [ weight\nmanagement ](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/how-to-lose-weight-as-fast-\nas-possible) , are by your own choice. Other reasons, such as a [ lack of\naccess to food ](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/food-deserts) , aren\u2019t\nnecessarily your choice.\n\nIn general, stopping food consumption hours before bedtime is generally\nconsidered healthy as long as you\u2019re getting adequate [ nutrition\n](https://www.healthline.com/health/food-nutrition) and [ calories\n](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/how-many-calories-per-day) throughout\nthe day.\n\nIf you\u2019re hungry before bedtime and concerned you won\u2019t be able to fall asleep\nbecause of an [ empty stomach ](https://www.healthline.com/health/how-long-\ndoes-it-take-for-your-stomach-to-empty) , there are many healthy foods you can\n[ eat at night ](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/healthy-late-night-\nsnacks) . If you don\u2019t have consistent access to food, we provide links to\nresources that may help.\n\nRead on to learn more about whether it\u2019s okay to go to bed hungry, what some\npossible side effects might be, and foods that are okay to eat before bed.\n\n##\n\nIs it OK to go to bed hungry?\n\nGoing to bed hungry may be OK if you\u2019re meeting nutrition requirements on a\ndaily basis or following a healthy weight loss plan. In many cases, a healthy\neating schedule may result in you feeling hungry before bedtime.\n\nHere are some reasons you may go to bed feeling hungry and whether or not this\nmay indicate an underlying issue that you need to address.\n\n###  Following a healthy meal schedule\n\nIn general, a [ healthy eating schedule\n](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/how-to-meal-prep) consists of three\nmeals a day with small [ snacks\n](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/snacking-good-or-bad) between meals if\nneeded.\n\nSo depending on when you go to bed, eating a well-rounded diet that concludes\nwith [ dinner ](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/healthy-dinner-ideas-for-\ntwo-2) in the early evening well before bedtime could result in you feeling a\nlittle bit hungry as you drift into dreamland hours later.\n\n###  Cutting back calories\n\nYou may fall asleep hungry if you\u2019re intentionally [ cutting back calories\n](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/35-ways-to-cut-calories) for weight\nloss.\n\nMake sure you\u2019re [ maintaining a well-balanced diet\n](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/best-diet-plans#section1) , even if\nyou\u2019re following a more restrictive diet, such as a [ keto\n](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/ketogenic-diet-101) or [ vegan\n](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/vegan-diet-guide) diet. This will\nensure your [ nighttime hunger ](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/10-ways-\nto-stop-eating-late-at-night) isn\u2019t a cause for concern.\n\nSome [ intermittent fasting diets\n](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/intermittent-fasting-guide) dictate the\ntimes of day you can eat. This may result in you feeling hungry before or\naround bedtime if you go to bed during a fasting period.\n\n###  Not getting enough sleep\n\nYou may also feel hungry before bed because you\u2019re [ not getting enough sleep\n](https://www.healthline.com/health/sleep-deprivation/effects-on-body) .\n\n[ Overtiredness ](https://www.healthline.com/health/overtired) can trigger the\nhormone [ ghrelin ](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/ghrelin) . This\nhormone spikes [ food cravings ](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/11-ways-\nto-stop-food-cravings) and the [ feeling of hunger\n](https://www.healthline.com/health/hunger-pangs) .\n\nAnother hormone called [ leptin\n](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/leptin-101) can also be triggered by\ninadequate sleep and cause you to feel hungry even after eating a meal.\n\nGetting a [ healthy amount of sleep\n](https://www.healthline.com/health/sleep/sleep-calculator) per night is\nessential to feeling less hungry when you go to bed.\n\n###  Undernutrition or malnutrition\n\nGoing to bed hungry may also be the sign of a more serious condition like [\nmalnutrition ](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/malnutrition) .\nExperiencing hunger at night because of a lack of nutrition and access to food\nis another issue entirely.\n\nUndernutrition is a type of malnutrition and is defined as consuming fewer\nthan [ 1,800 calories ](https://www.actionagainsthunger.org/world-hunger-\nfacts-statistics) a day, as well as lacking proper consumption of [ vitamins\n](https://www.healthline.com/health/food-nutrition/best-vitamins-to-take-\ndaily) , [ minerals ](https://www.healthline.com/health/mineral-deficiency) ,\nand other essential components to a well-balanced diet.\n\nProlonged undernutrition can contribute to slowed growth in children, as well\nas other health problems in adults and children.\n\n###  Millions of families face food insecurity\n\n[ Millions of households ](https://www.feedingamerica.org/hunger-in-\namerica/food-insecurity) in the United States are unable to provide enough\nfood for every person in their family to live an active, healthy life. If you\nor your family need help with food, click this link to find a [ food bank in\nyour area ](https://www.feedingamerica.org/find-your-local-foodbank) . You can\nalso apply for a Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Find out\nmore about this program [ here\n](https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/recipient/eligibility) .\n\nWas this helpful?\n\n##\n\nAre there side effects from going to bed hungry?\n\nGoing to bed hungry may make you feel a sense of emptiness or dissatisfaction\nbecause you haven\u2019t satisfied your appetite. But it may be healthier to go to\nbed hungry than eat too close to bedtime.\n\nThere are several side effects associated with eating right before bed. Eating\nafter dinner or late at night can result in weight gain and in an increased [\nbody mass index (BMI) ](https://www.healthline.com/health/body-mass-index) .\n\nYou may also experience [ indigestion\n](https://www.healthline.com/health/indigestion) or [ broken sleep\n](https://www.healthline.com/health/irregular-sleep-wake-syndrome) if you eat\nor drink too close to bedtime. Your [ metabolism\n](https://www.healthline.com/health/calories-burned-sleeping) also slows as\nyour body prepares for sleep and you don\u2019t typically need additional calories.\n\nSeveral research studies have highlighted the risks of eating too close to\nbedtime:\n\n* A  [ 2013 study ](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23036285/) found that eating within 4 hours of bedtime could result in eating more calories throughout the day.\n* A  [ 2014 study ](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25439026/) found that the increased caloric intake from eating later in the evening and closer to bedtime may result in eating extra calories and gaining weight because you end up eating more times throughout the day.\n* A  [ 2017 study ](https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/106/5/1213/4822338) found that eating closer to when your body begins to produce [ melatonin ](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/melatonin) (which occurs a few hours before bedtime) can result in an increased body fat percentage.\n\nEating late at night may also contribute to [ indigestion\n](https://www.healthline.com/health/indigestion) and [ sleep problems\n](https://www.healthline.com/health/sleeping-difficulty) .\n\n##\n\nWhat should I eat before bed?\n\nYou may feel hungry enough before bed that you need to eat a snack before\nturning out the lights.\n\nThere are several healthy foods and eating habits you can choose that can\nencourage sleep while also avoiding sleep problems and an upset stomach.\n\n###  Foods with tryptophan\n\nLate-night snacks can involve foods that contain the [ amino acid\n](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/essential-amino-acids) [ tryptophan\n](https://www.healthline.com/health/tryptophan) . These foods encourage sleep\nby activating the hormone [ serotonin\n](https://www.healthline.com/health/mental-health/serotonin) in your body.\n\nFoods that contain this amino acid include:\n\n* [ turkey ](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/turkey)\n* [ chicken ](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/protein-in-chicken)\n* [ fish ](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/11-health-benefits-of-fish)\n* [ nuts ](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/8-benefits-of-nuts)\n* [ eggs ](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/10-proven-health-benefits-of-eggs)\n\n###  Whole grains\n\nConsider eating a small portion of foods with tryptophan along with something\nmade with whole grains. Whole grains are [ complex carbohydrates\n](https://www.healthline.com/health/food-nutrition/simple-carbohydrates-\ncomplex-carbohydrates) and won\u2019t [ upset your stomach\n](https://www.healthline.com/health/stomachache-after-eating) .\n\n[ Whole grain foods ](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/whole-grain-foods)\ninclude:\n\n* [ bread ](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/healthiest-bread)\n* crackers\n* [ cereal ](https://www.healthline.com/health/best-low-carb-cereal-brands)\n\n###  What to avoid\n\nAvoid food that will take a long time to digest, upset your stomach, or make\nit difficult to sleep. These may include food that is:\n\n* [ fried ](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/why-fried-foods-are-bad)\n* [ spicy ](https://www.healthline.com/health/gerd/foods-to-avoid)\n* [ sugary ](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/14-ways-to-eat-less-sugar)\n* [ greasy ](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/greasy-food)\n\nAlso, be careful about the beverages you consume before bedtime.\n\nDrinking too much of anything could lead to frequent bathroom visits during\nthe night ( [ nocturia ](https://www.healthline.com/health/urination-\nexcessive-at-night) ).\n\nAdditionally, beverages containing [ alcohol\n](https://www.healthline.com/health/alcohol/effects-on-body) or [ caffeine\n](https://www.healthline.com/health/alcohol/effects-on-body) could make it\nmore difficult to fall or stay asleep.\n\n##\n\nHow can I prevent feeling hungry before bedtime?\n\nYou may want to adjust your daily eating habits to fill up long before winding\ndown for the day if you find yourself needing food before bedtime on a regular\nbasis due to hunger.\n\nExamining what and when you eat may help you adjust your diet to avoid the\nurge to eat a late-night snack.\n\nHere are some tips to avoid nighttime hunger or late-night eating:\n\n* **Determine how many daily calories you should be eating.** Divide up your food intake over the course of the day. Plan to finish eating well before bedtime. An average adult\u2019s diet consists of [ 2,000 calories ](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/2000-calorie-diet) every day.\n* **Consider eating three meals at regular times of the day.** Supplement these meals with small, healthy snacks as needed.\n* **Eat a diet focused on a variety of foods.** This includes [ fruits ](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/20-healthiest-fruits) , [ vegetables ](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/14-healthiest-vegetables-on-earth) , [ proteins ](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/20-delicious-high-protein-foods) , low-fat [ dairy ](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/20-healthiest-fruits) products, and whole grains.\n* **Try eating more protein and fiber at dinnertime.** Protein and [ fiber ](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/22-high-fiber-foods) will help to keep you feeling full.\n* **Avoid overeating unhealthy foods.** Stay away from foods that contain a lot of [ refined sugar ](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/refined-sugar) or [ salt ](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/salt-good-or-bad) , and are high in [ saturated fat ](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/saturated-fat) .\n* **Reconsider drinking your calories.** Beverages like [ smoothies ](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/are-smoothies-good-for-you) digest faster than solid foods.\n\n##\n\nHow can I get better access to food?\n\nNot having access to food or proper nutrition is a public health issue.\n\nAccording to [ Feeding America ](https://www.feedingamerica.org/hunger-in-\namerica/facts) , over 37 million people in the United States alone deal with\nhunger due to poverty or the lack of a local market that sells nutritious,\naffordable meals.\n\nFollowing the [ COVID-19 pandemic\n](https://www.healthline.com/health/coronavirus-covid-19) , this number has\nincreased. During 2020, the loss of jobs and housing linked to the pandemic\nresulted in nearly 54 million people losing consistent access to nutritious\nfood.\n\nThis means that millions go to bed hungry, but not by choice. Though going to\nbed hungry can help with sleep and weight loss, lack of access to food can\nactually [ increase your risk\n](https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/full/10.1377/hlthaff.2015.0645) of [\nobesity ](https://www.healthline.com/health/obesity) , [ asthma\n](https://www.healthline.com/health/asthma) , and other health problems.\n\nHere\u2019s what you can do if you go to bed hungry because of malnutrition or lack\nof food access:\n\n* Find a local [ food bank ](https://www.feedingamerica.org/find-your-local-foodbank)\n* Sign up for [ supplemental nutrition assistance programs (SNAP) ](https://www.usa.gov/food-help) through the U.S. government\n* Sign up for state and federal [ unemployment benefits ](https://www.usa.gov/unemployment) if you\u2019ve lost your job\n* Consider moving to an area with greater access to grocery stores and farmer\u2019s markets, if this is affordable for you\n\n##\n\nThe takeaway\n\nGoing to bed hungry can be safe as long as you\u2019re eating a well-balanced diet\nthroughout the day. Avoiding late-night snacks or meals can actually help\navoid weight gain and an increased BMI.\n\nIf you\u2019re so hungry that you can\u2019t go to bed, you can eat foods that are easy\nto digest and promote sleep.

Developmental cell death affects\nboth embryonically produced immature neurons and those immature neurons that\nare generated in regions of adult neurogenesis. Removal of substantial numbers\nof neurons that are not yet completely integrated into the local circuits\nhelps to ensure that maturation and homeostatic function of neuronal networks\nin the brain proceed correctly. External signals from brain microenvironment\ntogether with intrinsic signaling pathways determine whether a particular\nneuron will die. To accommodate this signaling, immature neurons in the brain\nexpress a number of transmembrane factors as well as intracellular signaling\nmolecules that will regulate the cell survival/death decision, and many of\nthese factors cease being expressed upon neuronal maturation. Furthermore,\npro-survival factors and intracellular responses depend on the type of neuron\nand region of the brain. Thus, in addition to some common neuronal pro-\nsurvival signaling, different types of neurons possess a variety of 'neuron\ntype-specific' pro-survival constituents that might help them to adapt for\nsurvival in a certain brain region. This review focuses on how immature\nneurons survive during normal and impaired brain development, both in the\nembryonic/neonatal brain and in brain regions associated with adult\nneurogenesis, and emphasizes neuron type-specific mechanisms that help to\nsurvive for various types of immature neurons. Importantly, we mainly focus on\n_in vivo_ data to describe neuronal survival specifically in the brain,\nwithout extrapolating data obtained in the PNS or spinal cord, and thus\nemphasize the influence of the complex brain environment on neuronal survival\nduring development.\n\n###  Similar content being viewed by others\n\n![](https://media.springernature.com/w215h120/springer-\nstatic/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41583-021-00433-z/MediaObjects/41583_2021_433_Fig1_HTML.png)\n\n###  [ Formation and integration of new neurons in the adult hippocampus\n](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41583-021-00433-z?fromPaywallRec=false)\n\nArticle  25 February 2021\n\n![](https://media.springernature.com/w215h120/springer-\nstatic/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41583-023-00760-3/MediaObjects/41583_2023_760_Fig1_HTML.png)\n\n###  [ Human neuronal maturation comes of age: cellular mechanisms and species\ndifferences\n](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41583-023-00760-3?fromPaywallRec=false)\n\nArticle  23 November 2023\n\n![](https://media.springernature.com/w215h120/springer-\nstatic/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41419-022-05340-4/MediaObjects/41419_2022_5340_Fig1_HTML.png)\n\n###  [ Diverse maturity-dependent and complementary anti-apoptotic brakes\nsafeguard human iPSC-derived neurons from cell death\n](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41419-022-05340-4?fromPaywallRec=false)\n\nArticle  Open access  21 October 2022\n\n##  Facts\n\n* During development neurons express a set of pro-survival/death molecules that are not present in adult brain.\n\n* Neuronal survival in the brain often relies on different external factors in comparison with the spinal cord and PNS.\n\n* Different types of neurons in the brain possess some common, but also distinct components of pro-survival signaling.\n\n* Immature neurons are more vulnerable to stress factors that trigger neuronal death than mature neurons.\n\n##  Open questions\n\n* How abundant are distinct components of pro-survival signaling in different types of neurons that might adapt neuronal survival to the region of the brain, that is, neuron type-specific survival?\n\n* How do survival mechanisms of embryonically and adult-born neurons differ, that is, survival in immature _versus_ mature brain?\n\n* During what period of brain development do the various types of neurons die?\n\n* What mechanisms account for higher vulnerability of immature neurons to stress factors?\n\nDuring brain development, an excessive number of neurons is generated and,\ndepending on the region and neuronal type, a varying number of neurons die\nbefore they mature.

Indeed, pro-survival\nsignaling does converge on some common core components ( [ Figure 2\n](/articles/cddis201764#Fig2) ). However, data accumulated over the recent\nyears show that different types of neurons in the brain might use different\npro-survival mechanisms as there are a variety of routes by which core pro-\nsurvival components could be activated. Thus, we propose 'neuron type-\nspecific' pro-survival mechanisms that will heavily rely upon (1) composition\nof extracellular pro-survival factors that are available in a certain brain\narea at a certain time period, (2) composition of transmembrane molecules\n(e.g. receptors or ion channels) that are expressed on distinct types of\nneurons and (3) composition of cytosolic molecules that could propagate pro-\nsurvival signaling from the cell membrane toward common core components ( [\nFigure 2 ](/articles/cddis201764#Fig2) ).\n\n**Figure 2**\n\n[ ![figure 2](//media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-\nstatic/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fcddis.2017.64/MediaObjects/41419_2017_Article_BFcddis201764_Fig2_HTML.jpg)\n](/articles/cddis201764/figures/2)\n\nComponents of survival/death signaling in immature neurons. Extracellular pro-\nsurvival factors that are available in a certain brain area stimulate a\nvariety of receptors and ion channels on neurons located in the area.\nTranscription factors involved in neuronal differentiation determine what\ncombination of receptors and ion channels will be expressed on a particular\nneuron. Such neuron type-specific combination of receptors and channels\npropagates pro-survival signaling to intermediate components, some of which\nexpress broadly, whereas others have restricted expression only in one or few\ntypes of neurons. Finally, all pro-survival signaling converges on core\ncomponents that inhibit neuronal death\n\n[ Full size image  ](/articles/cddis201764/figures/2)\n\nIt should be noted that not only pro-survival, but also pro-death pathways\ncould be neuron type specific. In general terms, it is pro-survival signaling\nthat blocks intrinsic pro-death signaling, and when there is a lack of pro-\nsurvival signaling, pro-death pathways are triggered. However, in a recent\npaper  [ 19 ](/articles/cddis201764#ref-CR19 \"Nikoletopoulou V, Lickert H,\nFrade JM, Rencurel C, Giallonardo P, Zhang L et al. Neurotrophin receptors\nTrkA and TrkC cause neuronal death whereas TrkB does not. Nature 2010; 467:\n59\u201363.\") it was shown that survival of CNS neurons during development is\nregulated by 'dependence receptors' that activate pro-death signaling when not\nbound to their ligands (reviewed in Dekkers _et al._ [ 20\n](/articles/cddis201764#ref-CR20 \"Dekkers MP, Nikoletopoulou V, Barde YA .\nCell biology in neuroscience: death of developing neurons: new insights and\nimplications for connectivity.

Although\nthe extent of expression and the number of dependence receptors still remain\nto be determined in the developing brain, the presence of such a mechanism\nindicates that neuron type-specific pro-death pathways do exist.\n\n##  Neuron type-specific pro-survival mechanisms\n\nAs different types of neurons survive in different brain areas and at\ndifferent periods of brain development, the transcriptome of the surviving\nneuron should 'prepare' the neuron to survive in a certain environment. The\npreparation is coordinated by distinct sets of transcription factors that are\ninvolved in differentiation of specific types of neurons. These transcription\nfactors drive expression of transmembrane and intracellular molecules that are\nnecessary to recognize and respond to the local environment. Neurons failing\nto differentiate properly are less likely to respond to signals from local\nbrain environment and could be eliminated during maturation. Interestingly,\nthe period of developmental cell death differs across types of neurons/brain\nareas. For instance, GABAergic interneurons of the cortex and medium spiny\nneurons exhibit one peak of cell death at P7-P11  [ 1\n](/articles/cddis201764#ref-CR1 \"Southwell DG, Paredes MF, Galvao RP, Jones\nDL, Froemke RC, Sebe JY et al.

Thus, there is high pressure for adult-born neurons\nto integrate into the pre-existing mature circuits, which is absent for\nembryonically born neurons.

During perinatal development\nand in the regions of adult neurogenesis, neurons in the brain are\noverproduced and multitudes of immature neurons die before they reach\nmaturity. Although there are certain core components of survival/apoptotic\nmachinery in immature neurons, it seems that various types of neurons also\nexploit pro-survival pathways that are specific only for one or few type(s)\nand not utilized in others. Such _neuron type-specific_ components of pro-\nsurvival signaling could indicate adaptation toward an optimal survival rate\nof overproduced neurons according to type of neuron and brain region. The\nnumber, type and position of neurons that survived should affect both local\nneuronal circuits and higher brain activities, for example, oscillations. As\nthere is increasing evidence that some types of neurons are more susceptible\nto certain injuries in the developing brain, more targeted therapeutic\nstrategies might be needed to treat such brain disorders. The advantage of\ntargeting neuron type-specific pro-survival pathways is to avoid side effects\nof the therapy on other neuron/cell types that are not affected in the\ndisorder. Future studies will determine the extent to which neuron type-\nspecific pro-survival signaling is utilized in normal brain and in\npathological conditions and how it contributes to brain information\nprocessing.\n\n##  References\n\n1.

Goolsby, M.A.\n\nExpert reviewer:\n\nMolly Knudsen, M.S., RDN\n\nOctober 26, 2023\n\nWritten by\n\nJulie M. Goolsby, M.A.\n\nJulie M. Goolsby, M.A., received her Master's degree in women's studies from\nGeorgia State University.\n\nExpert review by\n\nMolly Knudsen, M.S., RDN\n\nRegistered Dietitian Nutritionist\n\nMolly Knudsen, M.S., RDN is a Registered Dietician Nutritionist with a\nbachelor\u2019s degree in nutrition from Texas Christian University and a master\u2019s\nin nutrition interventions, communication, and behavior change from Tufts\nUniversity. She lives in Newport Beach, California, and enjoys connecting\npeople to the food they eat and how it influences health and wellbeing.\n\nOctober 26, 2023\n\nSure, kale gets all the glory, but did you know it isn\u2019t the only green in\ntown? There are plenty of other greens out there that pack a powerful punch.\nIn fact, kale is just one variety of a whole category you should be eating\nmore of: bitter greens. Often overlooked because of their tart flavor profile,\nbitter greens are chock-full of good-for-your-gut fiber, potent antioxidants,\nand calming magnesium.\n\nCurious about the hype but intimidated by the flavor? Here's everything you\nneed to know about why bitter greens are so good for you and how to make them\nactually taste good.\n\n##  What are bitter greens?\n\nAs a very basic definition, bitter greens are green, leafy vegetables that\ntaste, well, bitter, because they contain chemical compounds known as\nglucosinolates  1  .\n\nMany of these veggies are members of the  Brassica  family, also known as\ncruciferous vegetables  like broccoli, cabbage, and kale, among others.\n\nBitter greens are so good for you because they are packed with vitamins and\nnutrients, including potassium,  calcium  , vitamins A and C, antioxidants,\nfiber, and even protein.\n\nSome common bitter greens include:\n\n  * Arugula \n  * Broccoli rabe \n  * Collard \n  * Dandelion \n  * Endive \n  * Kale \n  * Mustard \n  * Radicchio \n  * Spinach \n  * Watercress \n\n##  6 benefits of eating bitter greens\n\nYou've probably heard a million times to eat your greens, but why are they so\nimportant? In general,  eating a plant-based diet  with a variety of fruits\nand vegetables has been shown to provide a  healthy balance of vitamins,\nminerals, and fiber  2  . More specifically, bitter greens can provide key\nnutrients that boost digestion, heart health, and more.  Here are the top\nscience-backed health benefits of eating your bitter greens:\n\n1  .\n\n##  They are nutrient-dense\n\nBitter greens are packed with nutrients, including vitamins A, C, and K, as\nwell as potassium, calcium, and magnesium. They are also low in sodium and\nhigh in fiber. For example, just  one serving of kale  3  provides over 100\npercent of the recommended daily intake (RDI) of vitamin A and more than 40\npercent of the vitamin C RDI. Vitamin A  supports eye, heart, and kidney\nfunction  4  among other things.\n\n2  .\n\n##  They are antioxidant-rich\n\nGiven their high nutrient content, it's no surprise that bitter greens are\nalso rich in  antioxidants  . Dark green leafy vegetables like kale and\nspinach, and cruciferous vegetables like broccoli and cabbage, are  powerful\nsources of antioxidants, vitamins, polyphenols, and flavonoids  . Antioxidants\nprotect our cells from damage, preventing chronic disease, cognitive decline,\nand signs of aging like wrinkles.\n\n3  .\n\n##  They have cancer-fighting properties\n\nWhile more research is needed, cruciferous vegetables, including bitter\ngreens, have shown promise in  helping to prevent certain types of cancers  .\nIn a study of over 180,000 women, it was found that the higher intake of\nfruits and vegetables, specifically cruciferous vegetables, may reduce the\nrisk of  breast cancer  .\n\nAdditionally, lab studies on malignant, chemoresistant human melanoma cells\nhave shown that  dandelion root extract (DRE) may have potential as a\nchemotherapeutic agent  5  . DRE is already used as a \"detoxifying agent\" for\ntumors of the lung, breast, and uterus, as well as digestive disorders.\n\n4  .\n\n##  They support gut health and digestion\n\nResearch shows that eating a plant-based diet  helps support a healthy gut\nmicrobiome  6  \u2014meaning that it provides a diverse range of \"good\" bacteria.\nCruciferous vegetables, including bitter leafy greens, are excellent choices\nfor  providing prebiotic material to sustain gut health  7  . Prebiotics are\n\"food\" for the good bacteria  in your gut, which means they help your friendly\n\"gut bugs\" proliferate and survive. A healthy gut biome not only aids in\ndigestion, but it also helps to maintain your overall health.\n\n5  .\n\n##  They are packed with fiber\n\nNot only do bitter greens aid in digestion, but they are also high in fiber.\nDietary fiber in the form of vegetables and fruits provides considerable\nhealth benefits  2  , including better digestion and absorption of nutrients.\nSpinach, collard greens, turnip, and mustard greens are all fiber-boosting\nbitter greens to try.\n\n6  .\n\n##  They are calming\n\nThat's right, bitter leafy greens, along with several other healthy foods, can\nhelp ease symptoms of anxiety  . A study that included patients diagnosed with\ngeneralized anxiety disorder (GAD) showed that  antioxidants (particularly\nvitamins A, C, and E) can help to relieve symptoms of anxiety  8  .\nResearchers did note that the group that performed the best included\nantioxidant supplements in addition to medication.\n\nBitter greens are also high in  magnesium, which has been linked to a\nreduction of stress and anxiety symptoms  9  . Eating just half a cup of\nboiled spinach provides 20% of your daily value (DV) of magnesium. Just one\nmore reason to eat your greens!\n\n##  How to eat bitter greens (so they taste less bitter)\n\nBitter greens are an easy base for hearty salads. But, if you're overwhelmed\nby the bitterness of these potent greens, fear not. There are many ways to cut\nthe bitter in  bitter  greens. Here are just a few to try:\n\n###  Massage them\n\nTry taking bunches of greens and rubbing them with your hands until they look\na little wilted and darker green. This quick process helps to release the\nbitterness. Massaging greens with salad dressing will take even more of the\nbitterness away. Kale can be massaged with salad dressing for 10 plus minutes.\nIn fact, massaged kale salads keep well overnight in the refrigerator and\nthere will likely be no hint of bitterness but all the same nutrients!\n\n###  Pair with acidic foods\n\nAcidic foods are especially potent at balancing out the bitterness of bitter\ngreens. Use a splash of vinegar, lemon, or lime after cooking to brighten up\nthe flavor of the dish. Bitter greens are also a source of  plant-based iron\n, and pairing it with an acid also helps your body better absorb this iron!\n\n###  Cook\n\nThere are  a variety of cooking methods to make eating greens more palatable\n. From blanching to braising to blending in a smoothie, you may be surprised\nat how creative you can get with cooking bitter greens. Tougher leaves like\ncollard greens and kale and kale can withstand a lot of cooking and are great\ncandidates for blanching and braising.\n\n###  Add salt\n\nSalt is known to i  ncrease the intensity of desirable flavors  10  and\nsuppress unpleasant tastes such as bitterness. Salting bitter greens after\ncooking or eating them with salty foods can help increase the palatability of\nthese greens.\n\n##  4 bitter greens recipes to try:\n\n  1. Stir-Fried Kale  : This quick and easy kale dish makes a great side dish or addition to salads and other dishes. \n  2. Kale Breakfast Salad  : You read that right. Start your day off with your greens with this unique breakfast twist. \n  3. Kale Bowls  : Who knew you could do so much with kale? And if you get tired of kale, just switch it out for a different green. For example, spinach makes an easy and delicious stand-in. \n  4. Immune-Supporting Green Smoothie  : This smoothie squeezes in two cups of kale per serving! But don't worry, the citrus from the kiwi and orange and the spiciness from the ginger and turmeric help cut any of the bitterness. And bonus points because all these ingredients help keep your immune system running smoothly. \n\n##  The takeaway\n\nIn general, most people can't go wrong with adding these distinctive veggies\nto their diet for an instant health upgrade.\n\nThat said, some folks find that they are allergic to certain greens,\nparticularly kale, mustard, and  dandelion  . If you find yourself in this\ngroup, obviously you'll want to avoid the offending veggies.\n\nIf you have questions about your diet or health condition\u2014particularly if you\nhave any digestive disorders\u2014speak with your doctor first before introducing\nany new foods to your diet.\n\n###  10 Sources\n\n  1. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11887749 \n  2. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3649719/ \n  3. https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/19476337.2013.850743 \n  4. https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminA-Consumer/ \n  5. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3018636/ \n  6. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6478664/ \n  7. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5915727/ \n  8. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3512361/ \n  9. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK507250/ \n  10. https://www.nature.com/articles/42388 \n\n##  Watch Next\n\nEnjoy some of our favorite clips from  classes\n\nWatch Next\n\nEnjoy some of our favorite clips from  classes\n\n###  What Is Meditation?\n\nMindfulness/Spirituality | Light Watkins \n\n###  Box Breathing\n\nMindfulness/Spirituality | Gwen Dittmar \n\n###  What Breathwork Can Address\n\nMindfulness/Spirituality | Gwen Dittmar \n\n###  The 8 Limbs of Yoga - What is Asana?\n\nYoga | Caley Alyssa \n\n###  Two Standing Postures to Open Up Tight Hips\n\nYoga | Caley Alyssa \n\n###  How Plants Can Optimize Athletic Performance\n\nNutrition | Rich Roll \n\n###  What to Eat Before a Workout\n\nNutrition | Rich Roll \n\n###  How Ayurveda Helps Us Navigate Modern Life\n\nNutrition | Sahara Rose \n\n###  Messages About Love & Relationships\n\nLove & Relationships | Esther Perel \n\n###  Love Languages\n\nLove & Relationships | Esther Perel \n\nRelated Videos (  10  )\n\n###  What Is Meditation?\n\n###  Box Breathing\n\n###  What Breathwork Can Address\n\n###  The 8 Limbs of Yoga - What is Asana?\n\n###  Two Standing Postures to Open Up Tight Hips\n\n###  How Plants Can Optimize Athletic Performance\n\n###  What to Eat Before a Workout\n\n###  How Ayurveda Helps Us Navigate Modern Life\n\n###  Messages About Love & Relationships\n\n###  Love Languages\n\n#####  Advertisement\n\nThis ad is displayed using third party content and we do not control its\naccessibility features.\n\n##  More On This Topic\n\nRecipes\n\n###  This Creamy Cilantro Salmon Is A Sheet Pan Dinner Worthy Of Company\n\nCarissa Stanton\n\nFood Trends\n\n###  This Oil Has 25% More Healthy Fats Than Olive Oil (Nope, Not Avocado!)\n\nBraelyn Wood\n\nFunctional Food\n\n###  These 5 Underrated Foods Give You The Most Nutritional Bang For Your Buck\n\nJason Wachob\n\nBeauty\n\n###  Gua Sha Experts On How To Lift & Depuff Your Eyes In No Time\n\nAlexandra Engler\n\nBeauty\n\n###  This Lotion Will Get Your Skin Smooth & Silky In No Time \u2014 Reviewers\nAgree\n\nAlexandra Engler\n\nSpirituality\n\n###  This Is The Only Guide To Full Moon Rituals You'll Ever Need\n\nSarah Regan\n\nRecipes\n\n###  This Creamy Cilantro Salmon Is A Sheet Pan Dinner Worthy Of Company\n\nCarissa Stanton\n\nFood Trends\n\n###  This Oil Has 25% More Healthy Fats Than Olive Oil (Nope, Not Avocado!)\n\nBraelyn Wood\n\nFunctional Food\n\n###  These 5 Underrated Foods Give You The Most Nutritional Bang For Your Buck\n\nJason Wachob\n\nBeauty\n\n###  Gua Sha Experts On How To Lift & Depuff Your Eyes In No Time\n\nAlexandra Engler\n\nBeauty\n\n###  This Lotion Will Get Your Skin Smooth & Silky In No Time \u2014 Reviewers\nAgree\n\nAlexandra Engler\n\nSpirituality\n\n###  This Is The Only Guide To Full Moon Rituals You'll Ever Need\n\nSarah Regan\n\nmore  Food\n\n#####  Advertisement\n\nThis ad is displayed using third party content and we do not control its\naccessibility features.\n\n##  Popular Stories\n\nApple Cider Vinegar: Benefits The Mother Safety & Use  10 Health Benefits Of\nMoringa Powder According To Science  Anti-Inflammatory Diet: Foods And Tips To\nReduce Inflammation  Sea Vegetables: Benefits Varieties How To Eat & More\nBovine Collagen: Benefits & The Importance Of Grass-Fed  23 Immune-Boosting\nFoods: Fruits Veggies Proteins & More\n\n#####  Advertisement\n\nThis ad is displayed using third party content and we do not control its\naccessibility features.\n\nAbout us  Contact  Write for us  Jobs  Advertise  Become an Affiliate\nCollective\n\nInstagram  Facebook  Twitter  Pinterest  YouTube\n\n\u00a9 2009 -  2024  mindbodygreen LLC.

An important first step is to understand how noise causes hearing\nloss.\n\nLoud Noise Can Cause Hearing Loss Quickly or Over Time\n\nHearing loss can result from a single loud sound (like firecrackers) near your\near. Or, more often, hearing loss can result over time from damage caused by\nrepeated exposures to loud sounds. The louder the sound, the shorter the\namount of time it takes for hearing loss to occur. The longer the exposure,\nthe greater the risk for hearing loss (especially when hearing protection is\nnot used or there is not enough time for the ears to rest between exposures).\n\nHere are some sources of loud noise that you may be exposed to. If you are\nrepeatedly exposed to them over time, they can cause hearing loss.\n\nEveryday Activities\n\n  * Music from smartphones and personal listening devices, particularly when the volume is set close to the maximum \n  * Fitness classes \n  * Children\u2019s toys \n\nEvents\n\n  * Concerts, restaurants, and bars \n  * Sporting events, such as football, hockey, and soccer games \n  * Motorized sporting events, such as monster truck shows, stock car or road races, and snowmobiling \n  * Movie theaters \n\nTools and More\n\n  * Power tools \n  * Gas-powered lawnmowers and leaf blowers \n  * Sirens \n  * Firearms \n  * Firecrackers \n\nCommon Sources of Noise and Decibel Levels\n\nSound is measured in decibels (dB). A whisper is about 30 dB, normal\nconversation is about 60 dB, and a motorcycle engine running is about 95 dB.\nNoise above 70 dB over a prolonged period of time may start to damage your\nhearing. Loud noise above 120 dB can cause immediate harm to your ears.\n\nThe table below shows dB levels and how noise from everyday sources can affect\nyour hearing.\n\nSounds and Noises  Everyday Sounds and Noises  |  Average Sound Level (measured in decibels)  |  Typical Response (after routine or repeated exposure)   \n---|---|---  \nSoftest sound that can be heard  |  0  |  Sounds at these dB levels typically don\u2019t cause any hearing damage.   \nNormal breathing  |  10   \nTicking watch  |  20   \nSoft whisper  |  30   \nRefrigerator hum  |  40   \nNormal conversation, air conditioner  |  60   \nWashing machine, dishwasher  |  70  |  You may feel annoyed by the noise   \nCity traffic (inside the car)  |  80\u201385  |  You may feel very annoyed   \nGas-powered lawnmowers and leaf blowers  |  80-85  |  Damage to hearing possible after 2 hours of exposure   \nMotorcycle  |  95  |  Damage to hearing possible after about 50 minutes of exposure   \nApproaching subway train, car horn at 16 feet (5 meters), and sporting events (such as hockey playoffs and football games)  |  100  |  Hearing loss possible after 15 minutes   \nThe maximum volume level for personal listening devices; a very loud radio, stereo, or television; and loud entertainment venues (such as nightclubs, bars, and rock concerts)  |  105\u2013110  |  Hearing loss possible in less than 5 minutes   \nShouting or barking in the ear  |  110  |  Hearing loss possible in less than 2 minutes   \nStanding beside or near sirens  |  120  |  Pain and ear injury   \nFirecrackers  |  140\u2013150  |  Pain and ear injury   \n  \nThe time estimates listed in the \u201cTypical Response\u201d column are based on the\nNIOSH exchange rate of 3 dB. For more information, visit  NIOSH\u2019s website  .\n\nMore about decibels\n\nSounds May Be Louder Than What You Hear\n\nHow loud something sounds to you is not the same as the actual intensity of\nthat sound. Sound intensity is the amount of sound energy in a confined space.\nIt is measured in decibels (dB). The decibel scale is logarithmic, which means\nthat loudness is not directly proportional to sound intensity. Instead, the\nintensity of a sound grows very fast. This means that a sound at 20 dB is 10\ntimes more intense than a sound at 10 dB. Also, the intensity of a sound at\n100 dB is one billion times more powerful compared to a sound at 10 dB.\n\nTwo sounds that have equal intensity are not necessarily equally loud.\nLoudness refers to how you perceive audible sounds. A sound that seems loud in\na quiet room might not be noticeable when you are on a street corner with\nheavy traffic, even though the sound intensity is the same. In general, to\nmeasure loudness, a sound must be increased by 10 dB to be perceived as twice\nas loud. For example, ten violins would sound only twice as loud as one\nviolin.\n\nThe risk of damaging your hearing from noise increases with the sound\nintensity, not the loudness of the sound. If you need to raise your voice to\nbe heard at an arm\u2019s length, the noise level in the environment is likely\nabove 85 dB in sound intensity and could damage your hearing over time.\n\nTop of Page\n\nHow Do I Know the Sound Level is Safe?\n\nThe effect of lower noise levels over long periods is the same as louder noise\nlevels over a shorter period. You can use a sound level meter (SLM) to measure\nnoise around you. Free SLMs developed as smartphone apps are available. Some\nof these apps can predict your maximum allowable daily noise dose, like the\nNIOSH SLM app  developed for iOS devices to help promote better hearing health\nand prevention efforts. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the\nWorld Health Organization (WHO) recommend maintaining environmental noises\nbelow 70 dBA over 24-hours (75 dBA over 8-hours) to prevent noise-induced\nhearing loss. The EPA also specified limits for speech interference and\nannoyance at 55 dBA for outdoors activities and 45 dBA for indoor activities.\nMore details about this topic can be found on the NIOSH Science Blog \u2014\nUnderstanding Noise Exposure Limits: Occupational vs. General Environmental\nNoise  .\n\nLooking for Data?\n\nIf you are looking for data on noise levels from published studies and noise\nlevel tests, visit\n\n  * NIOSH Power Tools Database \n  * NIOSH Sound Level Meter app \n  * NIOSH Science Blog \n  * Noise Navigator  TM  Sound Level Database \n  * Sight & Hearing Association Noisy Toys List \n  * NIOSH Science Blog: NIOSH Sound Level Meter App \n\nLast Reviewed:  November 8, 2022\n\nSource:  National Center for Environmental Health\n\n  * Facebook \n  * Twitter \n  * LinkedIn \n  * Syndicate \n\nhome  Environmental Health\n\n  * Loud Noise Can Cause Hearing Loss  plus icon \n    * What Noises Cause Hearing Loss? \n    * How Does Loud Noise Cause Hearing Loss? \n    * How Do I Know if I Have Hearing Loss Caused by Loud Noise? \n    * How Do I Prevent Hearing Loss from Loud Noise? \n    * What If I Already Have Hearing Loss? \n    * Additional Resources \n    * Public Health and Scientific Info \n    * #SafeHearingSelfie \n    * Teens on Noise-Induced Hearing Loss \n  * Toolkit \n\n  * About CDC \n  * Contact Us \n  * 800-232-4636 \n\nFacebook  Twitter  Instagram  LinkedIn  Youtube  Pinterest  Snapchat\n\n  * CONTACT CDC \n\nContact Us\n\nCall 800-232-4636\n\nEmail Us\n\n  * ABOUT CDC \n\n    * About CDC \n    * Jobs \n    * Funding \n\n  * POLICIES \n\n    * Accessibility \n    * External Links \n    * Privacy \n    * Policies \n    * No Fear Act \n    * FOIA \n    * OIG \n    * Nondiscrimination \n    * Vulnerability Disclosure Policy \n\n  * CONNECT WITH US \n\n    * Facebook \n    * Twitter \n    * Instagram \n    * LinkedIn \n\n    * Youtube \n    * Pinterest \n    * Snapchat \n    * Email \n\n  * LANGUAGES \n\n    * Espa\u00c3\u00b1ol \n    * \u00e7\u00b9\u0081\u00e9\u00ab\u0094\u00e4\u00b8\u00ad\u00e6\u0096\u0087 \n    * Ti\u00e1\u00ba\u00bfng Vi\u00e1\u00bb\u0087t \n    * \u00ed\u0095\u009c\u00ea\u00b5\u00ad\u00ec\u0096\u00b4 \n    * Tagalog \n    * \u00d0 \u00d1\u0083\u00d1\u0081\u00d1\u0081\u00d0\u00ba\u00d0\u00b8\u00d0\u00b9 \n    * \u00d8\u00a7\u00d9\u0084\u00d8\u00b9\u00d8\u00b1\u00d8\u00a8\u00d9\u008a\u00d8\u00a9 \n    * Krey\u00c3\u00b2l Ayisyen \n    * Fran\u00c3\u00a7ais \n    * Polski \n    * Portugu\u00c3\u00aas \n    * Italiano \n    * Deutsch \n    * \u00e6\u0097\u00a5\u00e6\u009c\u00ac\u00e8\u00aa\u009e \n    * \u00d9\u0081\u00d8\u00a7\u00d8\u00b1\u00d8\u00b3\u00db\u008c \n    * English \n\n  * U.S. Department of Health & Human Services \n  * Accessibility \n  * External Links \n  * Privacy \n  * Policies \n  * No Fear Act \n  * FOIA \n  * Nondiscrimination \n  * OIG \n  * Vulnerability Disclosure Policy \n  * USA.gov \n\nSAS  stats\n\n####  Exit Notification / Disclaimer Policy\n\nClose\n\nLinks with this icon  indicate that you are leaving the CDC website.\n\n  * The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) cannot attest to the accuracy of a non-federal website. \n  * Linking to a non-federal website does not constitute an endorsement by CDC or any of its employees of the sponsors or the information and products presented on the website. \n  * You will be subject to the destination website's privacy policy when you follow the link. \n  * CDC is not responsible for Section 508 compliance (accessibility) on other federal or private website. \n\nFor more information on CDC's web notification policies, see  Website\nDisclaimers  .\n\nCancel  Continue\n\n"

    "content": "Hearing loss is a partial or total inability to hear. Hearing loss may be present at birth or acquired at any time afterwards.  Hearing loss may occur in one or both ears. In children, hearing problems can affect the ability to acquire spoken language, and in adults it can create difficulties with social interaction and at work. Hearing loss can be temporary or permanent. Hearing loss related to age usually affects both ears and is due to cochlear hair cell loss. In some people, particularly older people, hearing loss can result in loneliness.\nHearing loss may be caused by a number of factors, including: genetics, ageing, exposure to noise, some infections, birth complications, trauma to the ear, and certain medications or toxins. A common condition that results in hearing loss is chronic ear infections. Certain infections during pregnancy, such as cytomegalovirus, syphilis and rubella, may also cause hearing loss in the child. Hearing loss is diagnosed when hearing testing finds that a person is unable to hear 25 decibels in at least one ear. Testing for poor hearing is recommended for all newborns. Hearing loss can be categorized as mild (25 to 40 dB), moderate (41 to 55\u00a0dB), moderate-severe (56 to 70\u00a0dB), severe (71 to 90\u00a0dB), or profound (greater than 90\u00a0dB). There are three main types of hearing loss: conductive hearing loss, sensorineural hearing loss, and mixed hearing loss.\nAbout half of hearing loss globally is preventable through public health measures. Such practices include immunization, proper care around pregnancy, avoiding loud noise, and avoiding certain medications. The World Health Organization recommends that young people limit exposure to loud sounds and the use of personal audio players to an hour a day in an effort to limit exposure to noise. Early identification and support are particularly important in children. For many, hearing aids, sign language, cochlear implants and subtitles are useful. Lip reading is another useful skill some develop. Access to hearing aids, however, is limited in many areas of the world.\nAs of 2013 hearing loss affects about 1.1 billion people to some degree. It causes disability in about 466 million people (5% of the global population), and moderate to severe disability in 124 million people. Of those with moderate to severe disability 108 million live in low and middle income countries. Of those with hearing loss, it began during childhood for 65 million. Those who use sign language and are members of Deaf culture may see themselves as having a difference rather than a disability. Many members of Deaf culture oppose attempts to cure deafness and some within this community view cochlear implants with concern as they have the potential to eliminate their culture.\n\nDefinition[edit]\nA deaf person using a camera-equipped smartphone to communicate in sign language\nHearing loss is defined as diminished acuity to sounds which would otherwise be heard normally. The terms hearing impaired or hard of hearing are usually reserved for people who have relative inability to hear sound in the speech frequencies. Hearing loss occurs when sound waves enter the ears and damage the sensitive tissues The severity of hearing loss is categorized according to the increase in intensity of sound above the usual level required for the listener to detect it.\nDeafness is defined as a degree of loss such that a person is unable to understand speech, even in the presence of amplification. In profound deafness, even the highest intensity sounds produced by an audiometer (an instrument used to measure hearing by producing pure tone sounds through a range of frequencies) may not be detected. In total deafness, no sounds at all, regardless of amplification or method of production, can be heard.\nSpeech perception is another aspect of hearing which involves the perceived clarity of a word rather than the intensity of sound made by the word. In humans, this is usually measured with speech discrimination tests, which measure not only the ability to detect sound, but also the ability to understand speech. There are very rare types of hearing loss that affect speech discrimination alone.  One example is auditory neuropathy, a variety of hearing loss in which the outer hair cells of the cochlea are intact and functioning, but sound information is not faithfully transmitted by the auditory nerve to the brain.\nUse of the terms \"hearing impaired\", \"deaf-mute\", or \"deaf and dumb\" to describe deaf and hard of hearing people is discouraged by many in the deaf community as well as advocacy organizations, as they are offensive to many deaf and hard of hearing people.\nHearing standards[edit]\n\nSee also: Absolute threshold of hearing and Hearing range\n\nFurther information: Equal-loudness contour and A-weighting\nHuman hearing extends in frequency from 20 to 20,000\u00a0Hz, and in intensity from 0\u00a0dB to 120\u00a0dB HL or more. 0\u00a0dB does not represent absence of sound, but rather the softest sound an average unimpaired human ear can hear; some people can hear down to \u22125 or even \u221210\u00a0dB.  Sound is generally uncomfortably loud above 90\u00a0dB and 115\u00a0dB represents the threshold of pain. The ear does not hear all frequencies equally well: hearing sensitivity peaks around 3,000\u00a0Hz.  There are many qualities of human hearing besides frequency range and intensity that cannot easily be measured quantitatively. However, for many practical purposes, normal hearing is defined by a frequency versus intensity graph, or audiogram, charting sensitivity thresholds of hearing at defined frequencies.  Because of the cumulative impact of age and exposure to noise and other acoustic insults, 'typical' hearing may not be normal.\n\nSigns and symptoms[edit]\ndifficulty using the telephone\nloss of sound localization\ndifficulty understanding speech, especially of children and women whose voices are of a higher frequency.\ndifficulty understanding speech in the presence of background noise (cocktail party effect)\nsounds or speech sounding dull, muffled or attenuated\nneed for increased volume on television, radio, music and other audio sources\nHearing loss is sensory, but may have accompanying symptoms:\npain or pressure in the ears\na blocked feeling\nThere may also be accompanying secondary symptoms:\nhyperacusis, heightened sensitivity with accompanying auditory pain to certain intensities and frequencies of sound, sometimes defined as \"auditory recruitment\"\ntinnitus, ringing, buzzing, hissing or other sounds in the ear when no external sound is present\nvertigo and disequilibrium\ntympanophonia, also known as autophonia, abnormal hearing of one's own voice and respiratory sounds, usually as a result of a patulous (a constantly open) eustachian tube or dehiscent superior semicircular canals\ndisturbances of facial movement (indicating a possible tumour or stroke) or in persons with Bell's palsy\nComplications[edit]\nHearing loss is associated with Alzheimer's disease and dementia. The risk increases with the hearing loss degree. There are several hypotheses including cognitive resources being redistributed to hearing and social isolation from hearing loss having a negative effect. According to preliminary data, hearing aid usage can slow down the decline in cognitive functions.\nHearing loss is responsible for causing thalamocortical dysrthymia in the brain which is a cause for several neurological disorders including tinnitus and visual snow syndrome.\nCognitive decline[edit]\nHearing loss is an increasing concern especially in aging populations. The prevalence of hearing loss increases about two-fold for each decade increase in age after age 40. While the secular trend might decrease individual level risk of developing hearing loss, the prevalence of hearing loss is expected to rise due to the aging population in the US. Another concern about aging process is cognitive decline, which may progress to mild cognitive impairment and eventually dementia. The association between hearing loss and cognitive decline has been studied in various research settings. Despite the variability in study design and protocols, the majority of these studies have found consistent association between age-related hearing loss and cognitive decline, cognitive impairment, and dementia. The association between age-related hearing loss and Alzheimer's disease was found to be nonsignificant, and this finding supports the hypothesis that hearing loss is associated with dementia independent of Alzheimer pathology. There are several hypotheses about the underlying causal mechanism for age-related hearing loss and cognitive decline. One hypothesis is that this association can be explained by common etiology or shared neurobiological pathology with decline in other physiological system. Another possible cognitive mechanism emphasize on individual's cognitive load. As people developing hearing loss in the process of aging, the cognitive load demanded by auditory perception increases, which may lead to change in brain structure and eventually to dementia. One other hypothesis suggests that the association between hearing loss and cognitive decline is mediated through various psychosocial factors, such as decrease in social contact and increase in social isolation. Findings on the association between hearing loss and dementia have significant public health implication, since about 9% of dementia cases are associated with hearing loss.\nFalls[edit]\nFalls have important health implications, especially for an aging population where they can lead to significant morbidity and mortality. Elderly people are particularly vulnerable to the consequences of injuries caused by falls, since older individuals typically have greater bone fragility and poorer protective reflexes. Fall-related injury can also lead to burdens on the financial and health care systems. In literature, age-related hearing loss is found to be significantly associated with incident falls. There is also a potential dose-response relationship between hearing loss and falls\u2014greater severity of hearing loss is associated with increased difficulties in postural control and increased prevalence of falls. The underlying causal link between the association of hearing loss and falls is yet to be elucidated. There are several hypotheses that indicate that there may be a common process between decline in auditory system and increase in incident falls, driven by physiological, cognitive, and behavioral factors. This evidence suggests that treating hearing loss has potential to increase health-related quality of life in older adults.\nDepression[edit]\nDepression is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. In older adults, the suicide rate is higher than it is for younger adults, and more suicide cases are attributable to depression. Different studies have been done to investigate potential risk factors that can give rise to depression in later life. Some chronic diseases are found to be significantly associated with risk of developing depression, such as coronary heart disease, pulmonary disease, vision loss and hearing loss. Hearing loss can attribute to decrease in health-related quality of life, increase in social isolation and decline in social engagement, which are all risk factors for increased risk of developing depression symptoms.\nSpoken language ability[edit]\nPost-lingual deafness is hearing loss that is sustained after the acquisition of language, which can occur due to disease, trauma, or as a side-effect of a medicine. Typically, hearing loss is gradual and often detected by family and friends of affected individuals long before the patients themselves will acknowledge the disability. Post-lingual deafness is far more common than pre-lingual deafness. Those who lose their hearing later in life, such as in late adolescence or adulthood, face their own challenges, living with the adaptations that allow them to live independently.\nPrelingual deafness is profound hearing loss that is sustained before the acquisition of language, which can occur due to a congenital condition or through hearing loss before birth or in early infancy. Prelingual deafness impairs an individual's ability to acquire a spoken language in children, but deaf children can acquire spoken language through support from cochlear implants (sometimes combined with hearing aids). Non-signing (hearing) parents of deaf babies (90\u201395% of cases) usually go with oral approach without the support of sign language, as these families lack previous experience with sign language and cannot competently provide it to their children without learning it themselves. This may in some cases (late implantation or not sufficient benefit from cochlear implants) bring the risk of language deprivation for the deaf baby because the deaf baby would not have a sign language if the child is unable to acquire spoken language successfully. The 5\u201310% of cases of deaf babies born into signing families have the potential of age-appropriate development of language due to early exposure to a sign language by sign-competent parents, thus they have the potential to meet language milestones, in sign language in lieu of spoken language.\n\nCauses[edit]\n\nMain article: Causes of hearing loss\nHearing loss has multiple causes, including ageing, genetics, perinatal problems and acquired causes like noise and disease.  For some kinds of hearing loss the cause may be classified as of unknown cause.\nThere is a progressive loss of ability to hear high frequencies with aging known as presbycusis. For men, this can start as early as 25 and women at 30. Although genetically variable, it is a normal concomitant of ageing and is distinct from hearing losses caused by noise exposure, toxins or disease agents. Common conditions that can increase the risk of hearing loss in elderly people are high blood pressure, diabetes, or the use of certain medications harmful to the ear. While everyone loses hearing with age, the amount and type of hearing loss is variable.\nNoise-induced hearing loss (NIHL), also known as acoustic trauma, typically manifests as elevated hearing thresholds (i.e. less sensitivity or muting). Noise exposure is the cause of approximately half of all cases of hearing loss, causing some degree of problems in 5% of the population globally. The majority of hearing loss is not due to age, but due to noise exposure. Various governmental, industry and standards organizations set noise standards. Many people are unaware of the presence of environmental sound at damaging levels, or of the level at which sound becomes harmful. Common sources of damaging noise levels include car stereos, children's toys, motor vehicles, crowds, lawn and maintenance equipment, power tools, gun use, musical instruments, and even hair dryers. Noise damage is cumulative; all sources of damage must be considered to assess risk. In the US, 12.5% of children aged 6\u201319 years have permanent hearing damage from excessive noise exposure.  The World Health Organization estimates that half of those between 12 and 35 are at risk from using personal audio devices that are too loud. Hearing loss in adolescents may be caused by loud noise from toys, music by headphones, and concerts or events.\nHearing loss can be inherited. Around 75\u201380% of all these cases are inherited by recessive genes, 20\u201325% are inherited by dominant genes, 1\u20132% are inherited by X-linked patterns, and fewer than 1% are inherited by mitochondrial inheritance.  Syndromic deafness occurs when there are other signs or medical problems aside from deafness in an individual, such as Usher syndrome, Stickler syndrome, Waardenburg syndrome, Alport's syndrome, and neurofibromatosis type 2. Nonsyndromic deafness occurs when there are no other signs or medical problems associated with the deafness in an individual.\nFetal alcohol spectrum disorders are reported to cause hearing loss in up to 64% of infants born to alcoholic mothers, from the ototoxic effect on the developing fetus plus malnutrition during pregnancy from the excess alcohol intake. Premature birth can be associated with sensorineural hearing loss because of an increased risk of hypoxia, hyperbilirubinaemia, ototoxic medication and infection as well as noise exposure in the neonatal units. Also, hearing loss in premature babies is often discovered far later than a similar hearing loss would be in a full-term baby because normally babies are given a hearing test within 48 hours of birth, but doctors must wait until the premature baby is medically stable before testing hearing, which can be months after birth. The risk of hearing loss is greatest for those weighing less than 1500\u00a0g at birth.\nDisorders responsible for hearing loss include auditory neuropathy, Down syndrome, Charcot\u2013Marie\u2013Tooth disease variant 1E, autoimmune disease, multiple sclerosis, meningitis, cholesteatoma, otosclerosis, perilymph fistula, M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease, recurring ear infections, strokes, superior semicircular canal dehiscence, Pierre Robin, Treacher-Collins, Usher Syndrome, Pendred Syndrome, and Turner syndrome, syphilis, vestibular schwannoma, and viral infections such as measles, mumps, congenital rubella (also called German measles) syndrome, several varieties of herpes viruses, HIV/AIDS, and West Nile virus.\nSome medications may reversibly affect hearing. These medications are considered ototoxic. This includes loop diuretics such as furosemide and bumetanide, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) both over-the-counter (aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen) as well as prescription (celecoxib, diclofenac, etc.), paracetamol, quinine, and macrolide antibiotics. Others may cause permanent hearing loss. The most important group is the aminoglycosides (main member gentamicin) and platinum based chemotherapeutics such as cisplatin and carboplatin.\nIn addition to medications, hearing loss can also result from specific chemicals in the environment: metals, such as lead; solvents, such as toluene (found in crude oil, gasoline and automobile exhaust, for example); and asphyxiants. Combined with noise, these ototoxic chemicals have an additive effect on a person's hearing loss. Hearing loss due to chemicals starts in the high frequency range and is irreversible. It damages the cochlea with lesions and degrades central portions of the auditory system. For some ototoxic chemical exposures, particularly styrene, the risk of hearing loss can be higher than being exposed to noise alone. The effects is greatest when the combined exposure include impulse noise. A 2018 informational bulletin by the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) introduces the issue, provides examples of ototoxic chemicals, lists the industries and occupations at risk and provides prevention information.\nThere can be damage either to the ear, whether the external or middle ear, to the cochlea, or to the brain centers that process the aural information conveyed by the ears.  Damage to the middle ear may include fracture and discontinuity of the ossicular chain.  Damage to the inner ear (cochlea) may be caused by temporal bone fracture.  People who sustain head injury are especially vulnerable to hearing loss or tinnitus, either temporary or permanent.\n\nPathophysiology[edit]\nHow sounds make their way from the source to the brain\nSound waves reach the outer ear and are conducted down the ear canal to the eardrum, causing it to vibrate. The vibrations are transferred by the 3 tiny ear bones of the middle ear to the fluid in the inner ear. The fluid moves hair cells (stereocilia), and their movement generates nerve impulses which are then taken to the brain by the cochlear nerve.  The auditory nerve takes the impulses to the brainstem, which sends the impulses to the midbrain. Finally, the signal goes to the auditory cortex of the temporal lobe to be interpreted as sound.\nHearing loss is most commonly caused by long-term exposure to loud noises, from recreation or from work, that damage the hair cells, which do not grow back on their own.\nOlder people may lose their hearing from long exposure to noise, changes in the inner ear, changes in the middle ear, or from changes along the nerves from the ear to the brain.\n\nDiagnosis[edit]\n\nMain article: Diagnosis of hearing loss\nAn audiologist conducting an audiometric hearing test in a sound-proof testing booth\nIdentification of a hearing loss is usually conducted by a general practitioner medical doctor, otolaryngologist, certified and licensed audiologist, school or industrial audiometrist, or other audiometric technician. Diagnosis of the cause of a hearing loss is carried out by a specialist physician (audiovestibular physician) or otorhinolaryngologist.\nHearing loss is generally measured by playing generated or recorded sounds, and determining whether the person can hear them. Hearing sensitivity varies according to the frequency of sounds. To take this into account, hearing sensitivity can be measured for a range of frequencies and plotted on an audiogram. Other method for quantifying hearing loss is a hearing test using a mobile application or hearing aid application, which includes a hearing test. Hearing diagnosis using mobile application is similar to the audiometry procedure. Audiograms, obtained using mobile applications, can be used to adjust hearing aid applications. Another method for quantifying hearing loss is a speech-in-noise test. which gives an indication of how well one can understand speech in a noisy environment. Otoacoustic emissions test is an objective hearing test that may be administered to toddlers and children too young to cooperate in a conventional hearing test. Auditory brainstem response testing is an electrophysiological test used to test for hearing deficits caused by pathology within the ear, the cochlear nerve and also within the brainstem.\nA case history (usually a written form, with questionnaire) can provide valuable information about the context of the hearing loss, and indicate what kind of diagnostic procedures to employ. Examinations include otoscopy, tympanometry, and differential testing with the Weber, Rinne, Bing and Schwabach tests. In case of infection or inflammation, blood or other body fluids may be submitted for laboratory analysis.  MRI and CT scans can be useful to identify the pathology of many causes of hearing loss.\nHearing loss is categorized by severity, type, and configuration. Furthermore, a hearing loss may exist in only one ear (unilateral) or in both ears (bilateral).  Hearing loss can be temporary or permanent, sudden or progressive. The severity of a hearing loss is ranked according to ranges of nominal thresholds in which a sound must be so it can be detected by an individual. It is measured in decibels of hearing loss, or dB HL. There are three main types of hearing loss: conductive hearing loss, sensorineural hearing loss, and mixed hearing loss. An additional problem which is increasingly recognised is auditory processing disorder which is not a hearing loss as such but a difficulty perceiving sound. The shape of an audiogram shows the relative configuration of the hearing loss, such as a Carhart notch for otosclerosis, 'noise' notch for noise-induced damage, high frequency rolloff for presbycusis, or a flat audiogram for conductive hearing loss. In conjunction with speech audiometry, it may indicate central auditory processing disorder, or the presence of a schwannoma or other tumor.\nPeople with unilateral hearing loss or single-sided deafness (SSD) have difficulty in hearing conversation on their impaired side, localizing sound, and understanding speech in the presence of background noise.  One reason for the hearing problems these patients often experience is due to the head shadow effect.\nIdiopathic sudden hearing loss is a condition where a person as an immediate decrease in the sensitivity of their sensorineural hearing that does not have a known cause. This type of loss is usually only on one side (unilateral) and the severity of the loss varies. A common threshold of a \"loss of at least 30 dB in three connected frequencies within 72 hours\" is sometimes used, however there is no universal definition or international consensus for diagnosing idiopathic sudden hearing loss.\n\nPrevention[edit]\nIt is estimated that half of cases of hearing loss are preventable. About 60% of hearing loss in children under the age of 15 can be avoided. There are a number of effective preventative strategies, including: immunization against rubella to prevent congenital rubella syndrome, immunization against H. influenza and S. pneumoniae to reduce cases of meningitis, and avoiding or protecting against excessive noise exposure. The World Health Organization also recommends immunization against measles, mumps, and meningitis, efforts to prevent premature birth, and avoidance of certain medication as prevention. World Hearing Day is a yearly event to promote actions to prevent hearing damage.\nAvoiding exposure to loud noise can help prevent noise-induced hearing loss. 18% of adults exposed to loud noise at work for five years or more report hearing loss in both ears as compared to 5.5% of adults who were not exposed to loud noise at work. Different programs exist for specific populations such as school-age children, adolescents and workers. Education regarding noise exposure increases the use of hearing protectors. But the HPD (without individual selection, training and fit testing) does not significantly reduce the risk of hearing loss. The use of antioxidants is being studied for the prevention of noise-induced hearing loss, particularly for scenarios in which noise exposure cannot be reduced, such as during military operations.\nWorkplace noise regulation[edit]\nNoise is widely recognized as an occupational hazard. In the United States, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) work together to provide standards and enforcement on workplace noise levels. The hierarchy of hazard controls demonstrates the different levels of controls to reduce or eliminate exposure to noise and prevent hearing loss, including engineering controls and personal protective equipment (PPE). Other programs and initiative have been created to prevent hearing loss in the workplace. For example, the Safe-in-Sound Award was created to recognize organizations that can demonstrate results of successful noise control and other interventions. Additionally, the Buy Quiet program was created to encourage employers to purchase quieter machinery and tools. By purchasing less noisy power tools like those found on the NIOSH Power Tools Database and limiting exposure to ototoxic chemicals, great strides can be made in preventing hearing loss.\nCompanies can also provide personal hearing protector devices tailored to both the worker and type of employment. Some hearing protectors universally block out all noise, and some allow for certain noises to be heard. Workers are more likely to wear hearing protector devices when they are properly fitted.\nOften interventions to prevent noise-induced hearing loss have many components. A 2017 Cochrane review found that stricter legislation might reduce noise levels.  Providing workers with information on their sound exposure levels was not shown to decrease exposure to noise. Ear protection, if used correctly, can reduce noise to safer levels, but often, providing them is not sufficient to prevent hearing loss. Engineering noise out and other solutions such as proper maintenance of equipment can lead to noise reduction, but further field studies on resulting noise exposures following such interventions are needed. Other possible solutions include improved enforcement of existing legislation and better implementation of well-designed prevention programmes, which have not yet been proven conclusively to be effective. The conclusion of the Cochrane Review was that further research could modify what is now regarding the effectiveness of the evaluated interventions.\nThe Institute for Occupational Safety and Health of the German Social Accident Insurance has created a hearing impairment calculator based on the ISO 1999 model for studying threshold shift in relatively homogeneous groups of people, such as workers with the same type of job.  The ISO 1999 model estimates how much hearing impairment in a group can be ascribed to age and noise exposure.  The result is calculated via an algebraic equation that uses the A-weighted sound exposure level, how many years the people were exposed to this noise, how old the people are, and their sex. The model's estimations are only useful for people without hearing loss due to non-job related exposure and can be used for prevention activities.\nScreening[edit]\nThe United States Preventive Services Task Force recommends neonatal hearing screening for all newborns, as the first three years of life are believed to be the most important for language development. Universal neonatal hearing screenings have now been widely implemented across the U.S., with rates of newborn screening increasing from less than 3% in the early 1990s to 98% in 2009. Newborns whose screening reveals a high index of suspicion of hearing loss are referred for additional diagnostic testing with the goal of providing early intervention and access to language.\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics advises that children should have their hearing tested several times throughout their schooling:\nWhen they enter school\nAt ages 6, 8, and 10\nAt least once during middle school\nAt least once during high school\nWhile the American College of Physicians indicated that there is not enough evidence to determine the utility of screening in adults over 50 years old who do not have any symptoms, the American Language, Speech Pathology and Hearing Association recommends that adults should be screened at least every decade through age 50 and at three-year intervals thereafter, to minimize the detrimental effects of the untreated condition on quality of life. For the same reason, the US Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion included as one of Healthy People 2020 objectives: to increase the proportion of persons who have had a hearing examination.\n\nManagement[edit]\n\nMain article: Management of hearing loss\nAn in-the-canal hearing aid\nManagement depends on the specific cause if known as well as the extent, type and configuration of the hearing loss. Sudden hearing loss due to an underlying nerve problem may be treated with corticosteroids.\nMost hearing loss, that result from age and noise, is progressive and irreversible, and there are currently no approved or recommended treatments.  A few specific kinds of hearing loss are amenable to surgical treatment.  In other cases, treatment is addressed to underlying pathologies, but any hearing loss incurred may be permanent. Some management options include hearing aids, cochlear implants, middle ear implants, assistive technology, and closed captioning; in movie theaters, a Hearing Impaired (HI) audio track may be available via headphones to better hear dialog.\nThis choice depends on the level of hearing loss, type of hearing loss, and personal preference. Hearing aid applications are one of the options for hearing loss management. For people with bilateral hearing loss, it is not clear if bilateral hearing aids (hearing aids in both ears) are better than a unilateral hearing aid (hearing aid in one ear).\nIdiopathic sudden hearing loss[edit]\nFor people with idiopathic sudden hearing loss, different treatment approaches have been suggested that are usually based on the suspected cause of the sudden hearing loss. Treatment approaches may include corticosteroid medications, rheological drugs, vasodilators, anesthetics, and other medications chosen based on the suspected underlying pathology that caused the sudden hearing loss. The evidence supporting most treatment options for idiopathic sudden hearing loss is very weak and adverse effects of these different medications is a consideration when deciding on a treatment approach.\n\nEpidemiology[edit]\nDisability-adjusted life year for hearing loss (adult onset) per 100,000\u00a0inhabitants in 2004:     \u00a0\u00a0no data \u00a0\u00a0<250 \u00a0\u00a0250\u2013295 \u00a0\u00a0295\u2013340 \u00a0\u00a0340\u2013385 \u00a0\u00a0385\u2013430 \u00a0\u00a0430\u2013475   \u00a0\u00a0475\u2013520 \u00a0\u00a0520\u2013565 \u00a0\u00a0565\u2013610 \u00a0\u00a0610\u2013655 \u00a0\u00a0655\u2013700 \u00a0\u00a0>700\nGlobally, hearing loss affects about 10% of the population to some degree. It caused moderate to severe disability in 124.2\u00a0million people as of 2004 (107.9\u00a0million of whom are in low and middle income countries). Of these 65\u00a0million acquired the condition during childhood. At birth ~3 per 1000 in developed countries and more than 6 per 1000 in developing countries have hearing problems.\nHearing loss increases with age. In those between 20 and 35 rates of hearing loss are 3% while in those 44 to 55 it is 11% and in those 65 to 85 it is 43%.\nA 2017 report by the World Health Organization estimated the costs of unaddressed hearing loss and the cost-effectiveness of interventions, for the health-care sector, for the education sector and as broad societal costs.  Globally, the annual cost of unaddressed hearing loss was estimated to be in the range of $750\u2013790 billion international dollars.\nThe International Organization for Standardization (ISO) developed the ISO 1999 standards for the estimation of hearing thresholds and noise-induced hearing impairment. They used data from two noise and hearing study databases, one presented by Burns and Robinson (Hearing and Noise in Industry, Her Majesty's Stationery Office,  London, 1970) and by Passchier-Vermeer (1968). As race are some of the factors that can affect the expected distribution of pure-tone hearing thresholds several other national or regional datasets exist, from Sweden,  Norway, South Korea, the United States and Spain.\nIn the United States hearing is one of the health outcomes measure by the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), a survey research program conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics. It examines health and nutritional status of adults and children in the United States.  Data from the United States in 2011-2012 found that rates of hearing loss has declined among adults aged 20 to 69 years, when compared with the results from an earlier time period (1999-2004). It also found that adult hearing loss is associated with increasing age, sex, ethnicity, educational level, and noise exposure.  Nearly one in four adults had audiometric results suggesting noise-induced hearing loss. Almost one in four adults who reported excellent or good hearing had a similar pattern (5.5% on both sides and 18% on one side). Among people who reported exposure to loud noise at work, almost one third had such changes.\n\nSocial and cultural aspects[edit]\n\nMain articles: Social impact of profound hearing loss and Deaf culture\nThe sign for \"friend\" in American Sign Language\nPeople with extreme hearing loss may communicate through sign languages. Sign languages convey meaning through manual communication and body language instead of acoustically conveyed sound patterns. This involves the simultaneous combination of hand shapes, orientation and movement of the hands, arms or body, and facial expressions to express a speaker's thoughts. \"Sign languages are based on the idea that vision is the most useful tool a deaf person has to communicate and receive information\".\nDeaf culture refers to a tight-knit cultural group of people whose primary language is signed, and who practice social and cultural norms which are distinct from those of the surrounding hearing community. This community does not automatically include all those who are clinically or legally deaf, nor does it exclude every hearing person. According to Baker and Padden, it includes any person or persons who \"identifies him/herself as a member of the Deaf community, and other members accept that person as a part of the community,\" an example being children of deaf adults with normal hearing ability.  It includes the set of social beliefs, behaviors, art, literary traditions, history, values, and shared institutions of communities that are influenced by deafness and which use sign languages as the main means of communication.  Members of the Deaf community tend to view deafness as a difference in human experience rather than a disability or disease.  When used as a cultural label especially within the culture, the word deaf is often written with a capital D and referred to as \"big\u00a0D Deaf\" in speech and sign. When used as a label for the audiological condition, it is written with a lower case d.\nThere also multiple educational institutions for both deaf and Deaf people, that usually use sign language as the main language of instruction. Famous institutions include Gallaudet University and the National Technical Institute for the Deaf in the US, and the National University Corporation of Tsukuba University of Technology in Japan.\n\nResearch[edit]\nStem cell transplant and gene therapy[edit]\nA 2005 study achieved successful regrowth of cochlea cells in guinea pigs. However, the regrowth of cochlear hair cells does not imply the restoration of hearing sensitivity, as the sensory cells may or may not make connections with neurons that carry the signals from hair cells to the brain. A 2008 study has shown that gene therapy targeting Atoh1 can cause hair cell growth and attract neuronal processes in embryonic mice. Some hope that a similar treatment will one day ameliorate hearing loss in humans.\nRecent research, reported in 2012 achieved growth of cochlear nerve cells resulting in hearing improvements in gerbils, using stem cells. Also reported in 2013 was regrowth of hair cells in deaf adult mice using a drug intervention resulting in hearing improvement. The Hearing Health Foundation in the US has embarked on a project called the Hearing Restoration Project. Also Action on Hearing Loss in the UK is also aiming to restore hearing.\nResearchers reported in 2015 that genetically deaf mice which were treated with TMC1 gene therapy recovered some of their hearing. In 2017, additional studies were performed to treat Usher syndrome and here, a recombinant adeno-associated virus seemed to outperform the older vectors.\nAudition[edit]\nBesides research studies seeking to improve hearing, such as the ones listed above, research studies on the deaf have also been carried out in order to understand more about audition. Pijil and Shwarz (2005) conducted their study on the deaf who lost their hearing later in life and, hence, used cochlear implants to hear. They discovered further evidence for rate coding of pitch, a system that codes for information for frequencies by the rate that neurons fire in the auditory system, especially for lower frequencies as they are coded by the frequencies that neurons fire from the basilar membrane in a synchronous manner. Their results showed that the subjects could identify different pitches that were proportional to the frequency stimulated by a single electrode. The lower frequencies were detected when the basilar membrane was stimulated, providing even further evidence for rate coding.\n\nSee also[edit]\nAudiology\nDeaf hearing\nH.870\nSafe listening\nWorld Hearing Day"

    "content": "\nColor (American English) or colour (Commonwealth English) is the visual perception based on the electromagnetic spectrum. Though color is not an inherent property of matter, color perception is related to an object's light absorption, reflection, emission spectra and interference. For most humans, colors are perceived in the visible light spectrum with three types of cone cells (trichromacy). Other animals may have a different number of cone cell types or have eyes sensitive to different wavelength, such as bees that can distinguish ultraviolet, and thus have a different color sensitivity range. Animal perception of color originates from different light wavelength or spectral sensitivity in cone cell types, which is then processed by the brain.\nColors have perceived properties such as hue, colorfulness (saturation) and luminance. Colors can also be additively mixed (commonly used for actual light) or subtractively mixed (commonly used for materials). If the colors are mixed in the right proportions, because of metamerism, they may look the same as a single-wavelength light. For convenience, colors can be organized in a color space, which when being abstracted as a mathematical color model can assign each region of color with a corresponding set of numbers. As such, color spaces are an essential tool for color reproduction in print, photography, computer monitors and television. The most well-known color models are RGB, CMYK, YUV, HSL and HSV.\nBecause the perception of color is an important aspect of human life, different colors have been associated with emotions, activity, and nationality. Names of color regions in different cultures can have different, sometimes overlapping areas. In visual arts, color theory is used to govern the use of colors in an aesthetically pleasing and harmonious way. The theory of color includes the color complements; color balance; and classification of primary colors (traditionally red, yellow, blue), secondary colors (traditionally orange, green, purple) and tertiary colors. The study of colors in general is called color science.\n\nPhysical properties\nThe visible spectrum perceived from 390 to 710 nm wavelength\nElectromagnetic radiation is characterized by its wavelength (or frequency) and its intensity. When the wavelength is within the visible spectrum (the range of wavelengths humans can perceive, approximately from 390\u00a0nm to 700\u00a0nm), it is known as \"visible light\".\nMost light sources emit light at many different wavelengths; a source's spectrum is a distribution giving its intensity at each wavelength. Although the spectrum of light arriving at the eye from a given direction determines the color sensation in that direction, there are many more possible spectral combinations than color sensations. In fact, one may formally define a color as a class of spectra that give rise to the same color sensation, although such classes would vary widely among different species, and to a lesser extent among individuals within the same species. In each such class, the members are called metamers of the color in question. This effect can be visualized by comparing the light sources' spectral power distributions and the resulting colors.\nSpectral colors\n\nMain article: Spectral color\nThe familiar colors of the rainbow in the spectrum\u2014named using the Latin word for appearance or apparition by Isaac Newton in 1671\u2014include all those colors that can be produced by visible light of a single wavelength only, the pure spectral or monochromatic colors. The spectrum above shows approximate wavelengths (in nm) for spectral colors in the visible range. Spectral colors have 100% purity, and are fully saturated. A complex mixture of spectral colors can be used to describe any color, which is the definition of a light power spectrum.\nThe spectral colors form a continuous spectrum, and how it is divided into distinct colors linguistically is a matter of culture and historical contingency. Despite the ubiquitous ROYGBIV mnemonic used to remember the spectral colors in English, the inclusion or exclusion of colors is contentious, with disagreement often focused on indigo and cyan. Even if the subset of color terms is agreed, their wavelength ranges and borders between them may not be.\nThe intensity of a spectral color, relative to the context in which it is viewed, may alter its perception considerably according to the Bezold\u2013Br\u00fccke shift; for example, a low-intensity orange-yellow is brown, and a low-intensity yellow-green is olive green. In color models capable of representing spectral colors, such as CIELUV, a spectral color has the maximal saturation. In Helmholtz coordinates, this is described as 100% purity.\nColor of objects\nThe physical color of an object depends on how it absorbs and scatters light. Most objects scatter light to some degree and do not reflect or transmit light specularly like glasses or mirrors. A transparent object allows almost all light to transmit or pass through, thus transparent objects are perceived as colorless. Conversely, an opaque object does not allow light to transmit through and instead absorbing or reflecting the light it receives. Like transparent objects, translucent objects allow light to transmit through, but translucent objects are seen colored because they scatter or absorb certain wavelengths of light via internal scatterance. The absorbed light is often dissipated as heat.\n\nColor vision\n\nMain article: Color vision\nDevelopment of theories of color vision\n\nMain article: Color theory\nThe upper disk and the lower disk have exactly the same objective color, and are in identical gray surroundings; based on context differences, humans perceive the squares as having different reflectances, and may interpret the colors as different color categories; see checker shadow illusion.\nAlthough Aristotle and other ancient scientists had already written on the nature of light and color vision, it was not until Newton that light was identified as the source of the color sensation. In 1810, Goethe published his comprehensive Theory of Colors in which he provided a rational description of color experience, which 'tells us how it originates, not what it is'. (Schopenhauer)\nIn 1801 Thomas Young proposed his trichromatic theory, based on the observation that any color could be matched with a combination of three lights. This theory was later refined by James Clerk Maxwell and Hermann von Helmholtz. As Helmholtz puts it, \"the principles of Newton's law of mixture were experimentally confirmed by Maxwell in 1856. Young's theory of color sensations, like so much else that this marvelous investigator achieved in advance of his time, remained unnoticed until Maxwell directed attention to it.\"\nAt the same time as Helmholtz, Ewald Hering developed the opponent process theory of color, noting that color blindness and afterimages typically come in opponent pairs (red-green, blue-orange, yellow-violet, and black-white). Ultimately these two theories were synthesized in 1957 by Hurvich and Jameson, who showed that retinal processing corresponds to the trichromatic theory, while processing at the level of the lateral geniculate nucleus corresponds to the opponent theory.\nIn 1931, an international group of experts known as the Commission internationale de l'\u00e9clairage (CIE) developed a mathematical color model, which mapped out the space of observable colors and assigned a set of three numbers to each.\nColor in the eye\n\nMain article: Color vision \u00a7\u00a0Cone cells in the human eye\nNormalized typical human cone cell responses (S, M, and L types) to monochromatic spectral stimuli\nThe ability of the human eye to distinguish colors is based upon the varying sensitivity of different cells in the retina to light of different wavelengths. Humans are trichromatic\u2014the retina contains three types of color receptor cells, or cones. One type, relatively distinct from the other two, is most responsive to light that is perceived as blue or blue-violet, with wavelengths around 450 nm; cones of this type are sometimes called short-wavelength cones or S cones (or misleadingly, blue cones). The other two types are closely related genetically and chemically: middle-wavelength cones, M cones, or green cones are most sensitive to light perceived as green, with wavelengths around 540\u00a0nm, while the long-wavelength cones, L cones, or red cones, are most sensitive to light that is perceived as greenish yellow, with wavelengths around 570\u00a0nm.\nLight, no matter how complex its composition of wavelengths, is reduced to three color components by the eye. Each cone type adheres to the principle of univariance, which is that each cone's output is determined by the amount of light that falls on it over all wavelengths. For each location in the visual field, the three types of cones yield three signals based on the extent to which each is stimulated. These amounts of stimulation are sometimes called tristimulus values.\nThe response curve as a function of wavelength varies for each type of cone. Because the curves overlap, some tristimulus values do not occur for any incoming light combination. For example, it is not possible to stimulate only the mid-wavelength (so-called \"green\") cones; the other cones will inevitably be stimulated to some degree at the same time. The set of all possible tristimulus values determines the human color space. It has been estimated that humans can distinguish roughly 10 million different colors.\nThe other type of light-sensitive cell in the eye, the rod, has a different response curve. In normal situations, when light is bright enough to strongly stimulate the cones, rods play virtually no role in vision at all. On the other hand, in dim light, the cones are understimulated leaving only the signal from the rods, resulting in a colorless response. (Furthermore, the rods are barely sensitive to light in the \"red\" range.) In certain conditions of intermediate illumination, the rod response and a weak cone response can together result in color discriminations not accounted for by cone responses alone. These effects, combined, are summarized also in the Kruithof curve, which describes the change of color perception and pleasingness of light as a function of temperature and intensity.\nColor in the brain\n\nMain article: Color vision \u00a7\u00a0Color in the primate brain\nWhile the mechanisms of color vision at the level of the retina are well-described in terms of tristimulus values, color processing after that point is organized differently. A dominant theory of color vision proposes that color information is transmitted out of the eye by three opponent processes, or opponent channels, each constructed from the raw output of the cones: a red\u2013green channel, a blue\u2013yellow channel, and a black\u2013white \"luminance\" channel. This theory has been supported by neurobiology, and accounts for the structure of our subjective color experience. Specifically, it explains why humans cannot perceive a \"reddish green\" or \"yellowish blue\", and it predicts the color wheel: it is the collection of colors for which at least one of the two color channels measures a value at one of its extremes.\nThe exact nature of color perception beyond the processing already described, and indeed the status of color as a feature of the perceived world or rather as a feature of our perception of the world\u2014a type of qualia\u2014is a matter of complex and continuing philosophical dispute.\nThe visual dorsal stream (green) and ventral stream (purple) are shown. The ventral stream is responsible for color perception.\nFrom the V1 blobs, color information is sent to cells in the second visual area, V2. The cells in V2 that are most strongly color tuned are clustered in the \"thin stripes\" that, like the blobs in V1, stain for the enzyme cytochrome oxidase (separating the thin stripes are interstripes and thick stripes, which seem to be concerned with other visual information like motion and high-resolution form).  Neurons in V2 then synapse onto cells in the extended V4. This area includes not only  V4, but two other areas in the posterior inferior temporal cortex, anterior to area V3, the dorsal posterior inferior temporal cortex, and posterior TEO. Area V4 was initially suggested by Semir Zeki to be exclusively dedicated to color, and he later showed that V4 can be subdivided into subregions with very high concentrations of color cells separated from each other by zones with lower concentration of such cells though even the latter cells respond better to some wavelengths than to others, a finding  confirmed by subsequent studies.  The presence in V4 of orientation-selective cells led to the view that V4 is involved in processing both color and form associated with color but it is worth noting that the orientation selective cells within V4 are more broadly tuned than their counterparts in V1, V2 and V3. Color processing in the extended V4 occurs in millimeter-sized color modules called globs. This is the part of the brain in which color is first processed into the full range of hues found in color space.\nNonstandard color perception\nColor vision deficiency\n\nMain article: Color blindness\nA color vision deficiency causes an individual to perceive a smaller gamut of colors than the standard observer with normal color vision. The effect can be mild, having lower \"color resolution\" (i.e. anomalous trichromacy), moderate, lacking an entire dimension or channel of color (e.g. dichromacy), or complete, lacking all color perception (i.e. monochromacy). Most forms of color blindness derive from one or more of the three classes of cone cells either being missing, having a shifted spectral sensitivity or having lower responsiveness to incoming light. In addition, cerebral achromatopsia is caused by neural anomalies in those parts of the brain where visual processing takes place.\nSome colors that appear distinct to an individual with normal color vision will appear metameric to the color blind. The most common form of color blindness is congenital red\u2013green color blindness, affecting ~8% of males. Individuals with the strongest form of this condition (dichromacy) will experience blue and purple, green and yellow, teal and gray as colors of confusion, i.e. metamers.\nTetrachromacy\n\nMain article: Tetrachromacy\nOutside of humans, which are mostly trichromatic (having three types of cones), most mammals are dichromatic, possessing only two cones. However, outside of mammals, most vertebrate are tetrachromatic, having four types of cones, and includes most, birds, reptiles, amphibians and bony fish. An extra dimension of color vision means these vertebrates can see two distinct colors that a normal human would view as metamers. Some invertebrates, such as the mantis shrimp, have an even higher number of cones (12) that could lead to a richer color gamut than even imaginable by humans.\nThe existence of human tetrachromats is a contentious notion. As many as half of all human females have 4 distinct cone classes, which could enable tetrachromacy. However, a distinction must be made between retinal (or weak) tetrachromats, which express four cone classes in the retina, and functional (or strong) tetrachromats, which are able to make the enhanced color discriminations expected of tetrachromats. In fact, there is only one peer-reviewed report of a functional tetrachromat. It is estimated that while the average person is able to see one million colors, someone with functional tetrachromacy could see a hundred million colors.\nSynesthesia\n\nMain article: Synesthesia\nIn certain forms of synesthesia, perceiving letters and numbers (grapheme\u2013color synesthesia) or hearing sounds (chromesthesia) will evoke a perception of color. Behavioral and functional neuroimaging experiments have demonstrated that these color experiences lead to changes in behavioral tasks and lead to increased activation of brain regions involved in color perception, thus demonstrating their reality, and similarity to real color percepts, albeit evoked through a non-standard route. Synesthesia can occur genetically, with 4% of the population having variants associated with the condition. Synesthesia has also been known to occur with brain damage, drugs, and sensory deprivation.\nThe philosopher Pythagoras experienced synesthesia and provided one of the first written accounts of the condition in approximately 550 BCE. He created mathematical equations for musical notes that could form part of a scale, such as an octave.\nAfterimages\n\nMain article: Afterimage\nAfter exposure to strong light in their sensitivity range, photoreceptors of a given type become desensitized. For a few seconds after the light ceases, they will continue to signal less strongly than they otherwise would. Colors observed during that period will appear to lack the color component detected by the desensitized photoreceptors. This effect is responsible for the phenomenon of afterimages, in which the eye may continue to see a bright figure after looking away from it, but in a complementary color. Afterimage effects have also been used by artists, including Vincent van Gogh.\nColor constancy\n\nMain article: Color constancy\nWhen an artist uses a limited color palette, the human eye tends to compensate by seeing any gray or neutral color as the color which is missing from the color wheel. For example, in a limited palette consisting of red, yellow, black, and white, a mixture of yellow and black will appear as a variety of green, a mixture of red and black will appear as a variety of purple, and pure gray will appear bluish.\nThe trichromatic theory is strictly true when the visual system is in a fixed state of adaptation. In reality, the visual system is constantly adapting to changes in the environment and compares the various colors in a scene to reduce the effects of the illumination. If a scene is illuminated with one light, and then with another, as long as the difference between the light sources stays within a reasonable range, the colors in the scene appear relatively constant to us. This was studied by Edwin H. Land in the 1970s and led to his retinex theory of color constancy.\nBoth phenomena are readily explained and mathematically modeled with modern theories of chromatic adaptation and color appearance (e.g. CIECAM02, iCAM). There is no need to dismiss the trichromatic theory of vision, but rather it can be enhanced with an understanding of how the visual system adapts to changes in the viewing environment.\n\nReproduction\n\nMain article: Color reproduction\nThe CIE 1931 color space xy chromaticity diagram with the visual locus plotted using the CIE (2006) physiologically relevant LMS fundamental color matching functions transformed into the CIE 1931 xy color space and converted into Adobe RGB. The triangle shows the gamut of Adobe RGB. The Planckian locus is shown with color temperatures labeled in Kelvins. The outer curved boundary is the spectral (or monochromatic) locus, with wavelengths shown in nanometers. The colors in this file are being specified using Adobe RGB. Areas outside the triangle cannot be accurately rendered since they are outside the gamut of Adobe RGB, therefore they have been interpreted. The colors depicted depend on the gamut and color accuracy of your display.\nColor reproduction is the science of creating colors for the human eye that faithfully represent the desired color. It focuses on how to construct a spectrum of wavelengths that will best evoke a certain color in an observer. Most colors are not spectral colors, meaning they are mixtures of various wavelengths of light. However, these non-spectral colors are often described by their dominant wavelength, which identifies the single wavelength of light that produces a sensation most similar to the non-spectral color. Dominant wavelength is roughly akin to hue.\nThere are many color perceptions that by definition cannot be pure spectral colors due to desaturation or because they are purples (mixtures of red and violet light, from opposite ends of the spectrum). Some examples of necessarily non-spectral colors are the achromatic colors (black, gray, and white) and colors such as pink, tan, and magenta.\nTwo different light spectra that have the same effect on the three color receptors in the human eye will be perceived as the same color. They are metamers of that color. This is exemplified by the white light emitted by fluorescent lamps, which typically has a spectrum of a few narrow bands, while daylight has a continuous spectrum. The human eye cannot tell the difference between such light spectra just by looking into the light source, although the color rendering index of each light source may affect the color of objects illuminated by these metameric light sources.\nSimilarly, most human color perceptions can be generated by a mixture of three colors called primaries. This is used to reproduce color scenes in photography, printing, television, and other media. There are a number of methods or color spaces for specifying a color in terms of three particular primary colors. Each method has its advantages and disadvantages depending on the particular application.\nNo mixture of colors, however, can produce a response truly identical to that of a spectral color, although one can get close, especially for the longer wavelengths, where the CIE 1931 color space chromaticity diagram has a nearly straight edge. For example, mixing green light (530\u00a0nm) and blue light (460\u00a0nm) produces cyan light that is slightly desaturated, because response of the red color receptor would be greater to the green and blue light in the mixture than it would be to a pure cyan light at 485\u00a0nm that has the same intensity as the mixture of blue and green.\nBecause of this, and because the primaries in color printing systems generally are not pure themselves, the colors reproduced are never perfectly saturated spectral colors, and so spectral colors cannot be matched exactly. However, natural scenes rarely contain fully saturated colors, thus such scenes can usually be approximated well by these systems. The range of colors that can be reproduced with a given color reproduction system is called the gamut. The CIE chromaticity diagram can be used to describe the gamut.\nAnother problem with color reproduction systems is connected with the initial measurement of color, or colorimetry. The characteristics of the color sensors in measurement devices (e.g. cameras, scanners) are often very far from the characteristics of the receptors in the human eye.\nA color reproduction system \"tuned\" to a human with normal color vision may give very inaccurate results for other observers, according to color vision deviations to the standard observer.\nThe different color response of different devices can be problematic if not properly managed. For color information stored and transferred in digital form, color management techniques, such as those based on ICC profiles, can help to avoid distortions of the reproduced colors. Color management does not circumvent the gamut limitations of particular output devices, but can assist in finding good mapping of input colors into the gamut that can be reproduced.\nAdditive coloring\nAdditive color mixing: combining red and green yields yellow; combining all three primary colors together yields white.\nAdditive color is light created by mixing together light of two or more different colors. Red, green, and blue are the additive primary colors normally used in additive color systems such as projectors, televisions, and computer terminals.\nSubtractive coloring\nSubtractive color mixing: combining yellow and magenta yields red; combining all three primary colors together yields black.\nTwelve main pigment colors\nSubtractive coloring uses dyes, inks, pigments, or filters to absorb some wavelengths of light and not others. The color that a surface displays comes from the parts of the visible spectrum that are not absorbed and therefore remain visible. Without pigments or dye, fabric fibers, paint base and paper are usually made of particles that scatter white light (all colors) well in all directions. When a pigment or ink is added, wavelengths are absorbed or \"subtracted\" from white light, so light of another color reaches the eye.\nIf the light is not a pure white source (the case of nearly all forms of artificial lighting), the resulting spectrum will appear a slightly different color. Red paint, viewed under blue light, may appear black. Red paint is red because it scatters only the red components of the spectrum. If red paint is illuminated by blue light, it will be absorbed by the red paint, creating the appearance of a black object.\nThe subtractive model also predicts the color resulting from a mixture of paints, or similar medium such as fabric dye, whether applied in layers or mixed together prior to application. In the case of paint mixed before application, incident light interacts with many different pigment particles at various depths inside the paint layer before emerging.\nStructural color\n\nFurther information: Structural coloration and Animal coloration\nStructural colors are colors caused by interference effects rather than by pigments. Color effects are produced when a material is scored with fine parallel lines, formed of one or more parallel thin layers, or otherwise composed of microstructures on the scale of the color's wavelength. If the microstructures are spaced randomly, light of shorter wavelengths will be scattered preferentially to produce Tyndall effect colors: the blue of the sky (Rayleigh scattering, caused by structures much smaller than the wavelength of light, in this case, air molecules), the luster of opals, and the blue of human irises. If the microstructures are aligned in arrays, for example, the array of pits in a CD, they behave as a diffraction grating: the grating reflects different wavelengths in different directions due to interference phenomena, separating mixed \"white\" light into light of different wavelengths. If the structure is one or more thin layers then it will reflect some wavelengths and transmit others, depending on the layers' thickness.\nStructural color is studied in the field of thin-film optics. The most ordered or the most changeable structural colors are iridescent. Structural color is responsible for the blues and greens of the feathers of many birds (the blue jay, for example), as well as certain butterfly wings and beetle shells. Variations in the pattern's spacing often give rise to an iridescent effect, as seen in peacock feathers, soap bubbles, films of oil, and mother of pearl, because the reflected color depends upon the viewing angle. Numerous scientists have carried out research in butterfly wings and beetle shells, including Isaac Newton and Robert Hooke. Since 1942, electron micrography has been used, advancing the development of products that exploit structural color, such as \"photonic\" cosmetics.\n\nCultural perspective\nColors, their meanings and associations can play a major role in works of art, including literature.\nAssociations\nIndividual colors have a variety of cultural associations such as national colors (in general described in individual color articles and color symbolism). The field of color psychology attempts to identify the effects of color on human emotion and activity. Chromotherapy is a form of alternative medicine attributed to various Eastern traditions. Colors have different associations in different countries and cultures.\nDifferent colors have been demonstrated to have effects on cognition. For example, researchers at the University of Linz in Austria demonstrated that the color red significantly decreases cognitive functioning in men. The combination of the colors red and yellow together can induce hunger, which has been capitalized on by a number of chain restaurants.\nColor plays a role in memory development too. A photograph that is in black and white is slightly less memorable than one in color. Studies also show that wearing bright colors makes you more memorable to people you meet.\nTerminology\n\nMain article: Color term\n\nSee also: Lists of colors and Web colors\nColors vary in several different ways, including hue (shades of red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and violet, etc), saturation, brightness. Some color words are derived from the name of an object of that color, such as \"orange\" or \"salmon\", while others are abstract, like \"red\".\nIn the 1969 study Basic Color Terms: Their Universality and Evolution, Brent Berlin and Paul Kay describe a pattern in naming \"basic\" colors (like \"red\" but not \"red-orange\" or \"dark red\" or \"blood red\", which are \"shades\" of red). All languages that have two \"basic\" color names distinguish dark/cool colors from bright/warm colors. The next colors to be distinguished are usually red and then yellow or green. All languages with six \"basic\" colors include black, white, red, green, blue, and yellow. The pattern holds up to a set of twelve: black, gray, white, pink, red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, brown, and azure (distinct from blue in Russian and Italian, but not English).\n\nSee also\nChromophore\nColor analysis\nColor in Chinese culture\nColor mapping\nComplementary colors\nImpossible color\nInternational Color Consortium\nInternational Commission on Illumination\nLists of colors (compact version)\nNeutral color\nPearlescent coating including Metal effect pigments\nPseudocolor\nPrimary, secondary and tertiary colors"

Visual perception refers to the brain\u2019s ability to\nmake sense of what the eyes see. Some children have 20/20 vision but they can\nstill have problems with visual perception processing. It has nothing to do\nwith their vision.  Why is it important?  Good visual perceptual skills are\nimportant for many every day skills such as reading, writing, completing\npuzzles, cutting, drawing, completing math problems, dressing, finding your\nsock on the bedroom floor as well as many other skills. Without the ability to\ncomplete these everyday tasks, a child\u2019s self-esteem can suffer and their\nacademic and play skills can also be compromised.  If a child has difficulties\nwith visual perception they may have problems with the following activities:\n\n  * Completing puzzles or dot-to-dot pictures. \n  * Spatial concepts such as  \u201cin, out, on, under, next to, up, down  and  in front  \u201d \n  * Differentiating between \u201cb, d, p, q\u201d. \n  * Reversing numbers or letters when writing. \n  * Losing their place on a page when reading or writing. \n  * Remembering left and right. \n  * Remembering the alphabet in sequence. \n  * Coping from one place to another (e.g. from board, from a book, from one side of the paper to the other). \n  * Dressing (i.e. matching shoes or socks). \n  * Discriminating between the size of letters and objects. \n  * Filtering out visual distractions such as colourful bulletin boards or movement in the room in order to attend to the task at hand. \n  * Sorting and organising personal belongings (i.e. may appear disorganised or careless in work). \n  * Hidden picture activities or finding a specific item on a cluttered desk. \n\nHere are some activities to help children with visual perception difficulties:\n\n  * Hidden pictures games  in books such as \u201cWhere\u2019s Wally\u201d and \u201cI spy\u201d. \n  * Picture drawing:  Practice completing partially-drawn pictures. \n  * Dot-to-dot \n  * Memory games:  Playing games such as  Memory  . \n  * Sensory activities:  Use bendable things such as pipe cleaners to form letters and shapes (because feeling a shape can help them visualise the shape). The letters can then be glued onto index cards, and later the child can touch them to \u201cfeel\u201d the shape of the letter. \n  * Construction-type activities  such as Duplo, Lego or other building blocks. \n  * Flash cards  with a correct letter on one side and an incorrectly formed letter on the other side. Have your child try to draw the letter correctly, then turn over the card to see if it is right. (Have them write in sand or with finger paint to make it more fun). \n  * Word search puzzles  that require your child to look for a series of letters. \n  * Copy 3-D block designs  using building blocks, Lego or Duplo. \n  * Identify objects by touch:  Place plastic letters into a bag, and have your child identify the letter by \u201cfeeling it\u201d. \n  * Bingo:  which requires your child to look for a specific number. \n\nIf you feel your child is having difficulties with their visual perception\nprocessing, you can contact an Occupational Therapist for an in-depth\nassessment.\n\n####  NEWSLETTER SIGNUP\n\nEmail Address\n\n###  Recent posts\n\nExploring books together!\n\nParent Tips\n\nStuttering and Typical Disfluency \u2013 What\u2019s the Difference?\n\nParent Tips\n\nWhy is Attention So Crucial for Your Child's Development?\n\nParent Tips\n\n##  QUICKLINKS\n\n  * Donate \n  * Careers \n  * Centre Calendar \n  * Weather Procedures \n  * Contact Us \n\n####  Opening Hours\n\nFortress Hill Centre\n\nMonday  |  08:30 - 18:00   \n---|---  \nTuesday  |  08:30 - 18:00   \nWednesday  |  08:30 - 18:00   \nThursday  |  08:30 - 18:00   \nFriday  |  08:30 - 18:00   \nSaturday  |  08:30 - 17:30   \nSunday  |  CLOSED   \n  \nNorth Point Centre\n\nMonday  |  ENQUIRIES ONLY   \n---|---  \nTuesday  |  08:30 - 18:00   \nWednesday  |  08:30 - 18:00   \nThursday  |  08:30 - 18:00   \nFriday  |  08:30 - 18:00   \nSaturday  |  08:30 - 17:30   \nSunday  |  CLOSED   \n  \n####  CONTACT US\n\n  * Unit 7, 4/F, Victoria Centre, 15 Watson Road, Fortress Hill, Hong Kong \n\n  * +852 2849 6138 \n\n  * +852 2849 6900 \n\n  * info@cdchk.org \n\n  * 3/F, North Point Welfare Facilities Block, 123 Java Road (Harbour North Phase 2), North Point, Hong Kong \n\n  * +852 2849 2018 \n\n  * +852 2849 2280 \n\n  * info@cdchk.org \n\nCopyright  \u00a9 The Child Development Centre.

    "id": "plant_cancer/Agrobacterium_tumefaciens.txt",
    "content": "\nAgrobacterium tumefaciens is the causal agent of crown gall disease (the formation of tumours) in over 140 species of eudicots. It is a rod-shaped, Gram-negative soil bacterium. Symptoms are caused by the insertion of a small segment of DNA (known as T-DNA, for 'transfer DNA', not to be confused with tRNA that transfers amino acids during protein synthesis), from a plasmid into the plant cell, which is incorporated at a semi-random location into the plant genome. Plant genomes can be engineered by use of Agrobacterium for the delivery of sequences hosted in T-DNA binary vectors.\nAgrobacterium tumefaciens is an Alphaproteobacterium of the family Rhizobiaceae, which includes the nitrogen-fixing legume symbionts. Unlike the nitrogen-fixing symbionts, tumor-producing Agrobacterium species are pathogenic and do not benefit the plant. The wide variety of plants affected by Agrobacterium makes it of great concern to the agriculture industry.\nEconomically, A. tumefaciens is a serious pathogen of walnuts, grape vines, stone fruits, nut trees, sugar beets, horse radish, and rhubarb, and the persistent nature of the tumors or galls caused by the disease make it particularly harmful for perennial crops.\nAgrobacterium tumefaciens grows optimally at 28\u00a0\u00b0C (82\u00a0\u00b0F). The doubling time can range from 2.5\u20134h depending on the media, culture format, and level of aeration. At temperatures above 30\u00a0\u00b0C (86\u00a0\u00b0F), A. tumefaciens begins to experience heat shock which is likely to result in errors in cell division.\n\nConjugation[edit]\nTo be virulent, the bacterium contains a tumour-inducing plasmid (Ti plasmid or pTi) 200 kbp long, which contains the T-DNA and all the genes necessary to transfer it to the plant cell. Many strains of A. tumefaciens do not contain a pTi.\nSince the Ti plasmid is essential to cause disease, prepenetration events in the rhizosphere occur to promote bacterial conjugation - exchange of plasmids amongst bacteria. In the presence of opines, A. tumefaciens produces a diffusible conjugation signal called N-(3-oxo-octanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone (3OC8HSL) or the Agrobacterium autoinducer. This activates the transcription factor TraR, positively regulating the transcription of genes required for conjugation.\n\nInfection methods[edit]\nAgrobacterium tumefaciens infects the plant through its Ti plasmid. The Ti plasmid integrates a segment of its DNA, known as T-DNA, into the chromosomal DNA of its host plant cells. A. tumefaciens has flagella that allow it to swim through the soil towards photoassimilates that accumulate in the rhizosphere around roots. Some strains may chemotactically move towards chemical exudates from plants, such as acetosyringone and sugars, which indicate the presence of a wound in the plant through which the bacteria may enter. Phenolic compounds are recognised by the VirA protein, a transmembrane protein encoded in the virA gene on the Ti plasmid. Sugars are recognised by the chvE protein, a chromosomal gene-encoded protein located in the periplasmic space.\nAt least 25 vir genes on the Ti plasmid are necessary for tumor induction. In addition to their perception role, virA and chvE induce other vir genes. The VirA protein has autokinase activity: it phosphorylates itself on a histidine residue. Then the VirA protein phosphorylates the VirG protein on its aspartate residue. The virG protein is a cytoplasmic protein produced from the virG Ti plasmid gene. It is a transcription factor, inducing the transcription of the vir operons. The ChvE protein regulates the second mechanism of the vir genes' activation. It increases VirA protein sensitivity to phenolic compounds.\nAttachment is a two-step process. Following an initial weak and reversible attachment, the bacteria synthesize cellulose fibrils that anchor them to the wounded plant cell to which they were attracted. Four main genes are involved in this process: chvA, chvB, pscA, and att. The products of the first three genes apparently are involved in the actual synthesis of the cellulose fibrils. These fibrils also anchor the bacteria to each other, helping to form a microcolony.\nVirC, the most important virulent protein, is a necessary step in the recombination of illegitimate recolonization. It selects the section of the DNA in the host plant that will be replaced and it cuts into this strand of DNA.\nAfter production of cellulose fibrils, a calcium-dependent outer membrane protein called rhicadhesin is produced, which also aids in sticking the bacteria to the cell wall. Homologues of this protein can be found in other rhizobia. Currently, there are several reports on standardisation of protocol for the Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. The effect of different parameters such as infection time, acetosyringone, DTT, and cysteine have been studied in soybean (Glycine max).\nPossible plant compounds that initiate Agrobacterium to infect plant cells:\nAcetosyringone and other phenolic compounds\nalpha-Hydroxyacetosyringone\nCatechol\nFerulic acid\nGallic acid\np-Hydroxybenzoic acid\nProtocatechuic acid\nPyrogallic acid\nResorcylic acid\nSinapinic acid\nSyringic acid\nVanillin\nFormation of the T-pilus[edit]\nTo transfer T-DNA into a plant cell, A. tumefaciens uses a type IV secretion mechanism, involving the production of a T-pilus. When acetosyringone and other substances are detected, a signal transduction event activates the expression of 11 genes within the VirB operon which are responsible for the formation of the T-pilus.\nThe pro-pilin is formed first. This is a polypeptide of 121 amino acids which requires processing by the removal of 47 residues to form a T-pilus subunit. The subunit was thought to be circularized by the formation of a peptide bond between the two ends of the polypeptide. However, high-resolution structure of the T-pilus revealed no cyclization of the pilin, with the overall organization of the pilin subunits being highly similar to those of other conjugative pili, such as F-pilus.\nProducts of the other VirB genes are used to transfer the subunits across the plasma membrane. Yeast two-hybrid studies provide evidence that VirB6, VirB7, VirB8, VirB9 and VirB10 may all encode components of the transporter. An ATPase for the active transport of the subunits would also be required.\nTransfer of T-DNA into the plant cell[edit]\nAgrobacterium cellAgrobacterium chromosomeTi Plasmid (a. T-DNA, b. vir genes, c. replication origin, d. opines catabolism)Plant cellPlant mitochondriaPlant chloroplastPlant nucleus VirA recognitionVirA phosphorylates VirGVirG causes transcription of Vir genesVir genes cut out T-DNA and form nucleoprotein complex (\"T-complex\")T-complex enters plant cytoplasm through T-pilusT-DNA enters into plant nucleus through nuclear poreT-DNA achieves integration\nThe T-DNA must be cut out of the circular plasmid. This is typically done by the Vir genes within the helper plasmid. A VirD1/D2 complex nicks the DNA at the left and right border sequences. The VirD2 protein is covalently attached to the 5' end. VirD2 contains a motif that leads to the nucleoprotein complex being targeted to the type IV secretion system (T4SS). The structure of the T-pilus showed that the central channel of the pilus is too narrow to allow the transfer of the folded VirD2, suggesting that VirD2 must be partially unfolded during the conjugation process.\nIn the cytoplasm of the recipient cell, the T-DNA complex becomes coated with VirE2 proteins, which are exported through the T4SS independently from the T-DNA complex.\nNuclear localization signals, or NLSs, located on the VirE2 and VirD2, are recognised by the importin alpha protein, which then associates with importin beta and the nuclear pore complex to transfer the T-DNA into the nucleus. VIP1 also appears to be an important protein in the process, possibly acting as an adapter to bring the VirE2 to the importin. Once inside the nucleus, VIP2 may target the T-DNA to areas of chromatin that are being actively transcribed, so that the T-DNA can integrate into the host genome.\n\nGenes in the T-DNA[edit]\nHormones[edit]\nTo cause gall formation, the T-DNA encodes genes for the production of auxin or indole-3-acetic acid via the IAM pathway. This biosynthetic pathway is not used in many plants for the production of auxin, so it means the plant has no molecular means of regulating it and auxin will be produced constitutively. Genes for the production of cytokinins are also expressed. This stimulates cell proliferation and gall formation.\nOpines[edit]\nThe T-DNA contains genes for encoding enzymes that cause the plant to create specialized amino acid derivatives which the bacteria can metabolize, called opines. Opines are a class of chemicals that serve as a source of nitrogen for A. tumefaciens, but not for most other organisms. The specific type of opine produced by A. tumefaciens C58 infected plants is nopaline.\nTwo nopaline type Ti plasmids, pTi-SAKURA and pTiC58, were fully sequenced. \"A. fabrum\" C58, the first fully sequenced pathovar, was first isolated from a cherry tree crown gall. The genome was simultaneously sequenced by Goodner et al. and Wood et al. in 2001. The genome of A. tumefaciens C58 consists of a circular chromosome, two plasmids, and a linear chromosome. The presence of a covalently bonded circular chromosome is common to Bacteria, with few exceptions. However, the presence of both a single circular chromosome and single linear chromosome is unique to a group in this genus. The two plasmids are pTiC58, responsible for the processes involved in virulence, and pAtC58, once dubbed the \"cryptic\" plasmid.\nThe pAtC58 plasmid has been shown to be involved in the metabolism of opines and to conjugate with other bacteria in the absence of the pTiC58 plasmid.  If the Ti plasmid is removed, the tumor growth that is the means of classifying this species of bacteria does not occur.\n\nBiotechnological uses[edit]\nTransformed plant tissue cultures\nThe Asilomar Conference in 1975 established widespread agreement that recombinant techniques were insufficiently understood and needed to be tightly controlled. The DNA transmission capabilities of Agrobacterium have been vastly explored in biotechnology as a means of inserting foreign genes into plants. Shortly after the Asilomar Conference, Marc Van Montagu and Jeff Schell discovered the gene transfer mechanism between Agrobacterium and plants, which resulted in the development of methods to alter the bacterium into an efficient delivery system for genetic engineering in plants. The plasmid T-DNA that is transferred to the plant is an ideal vehicle for genetic engineering. This is done by cloning a desired gene sequence into T-DNA binary vectors that will be used to deliver a sequence of interest into eukaryotic cells. This process has been performed using the firefly luciferase gene to produce glowing plants. This luminescence has been a useful device in the study of plant chloroplast function and as a reporter gene. It is also possible to transform Arabidopsis thaliana by dipping flowers into a broth of Agrobacterium: the seed produced will be transgenic. Under laboratory conditions, T-DNA has also been transferred to human cells, demonstrating the diversity of insertion application.\nThe mechanism by which Agrobacterium inserts materials into the host cell is by a type IV secretion system which is very similar to mechanisms used by pathogens to insert materials (usually proteins) into human cells by type III secretion. It also employs a type of signaling conserved in many Gram-negative bacteria called quorum sensing. This makes Agrobacterium an important topic of medical research, as well.\n\nNatural genetic transformation[edit]\nNatural genetic transformation in bacteria is a sexual process involving the transfer of DNA from one cell to another through the intervening medium, and the integration of the donor sequence into the recipient genome by homologous recombination. A. tumefaciens can undergo natural transformation in soil without any specific physical or chemical treatment.\n\nDisease cycle[edit]\nDisease cycle\nAgrobacterium tumefaciens overwinters in infested soils. Agrobacterium species live predominantly saprophytic lifestyles, so its common even for plant-parasitic species of this genus to survive in the soil for lengthy periods of time, even without host plant presence. When there is a host plant present, however, the bacteria enter the plant tissue via recent wounds or natural openings of roots or stems near the ground. These wounds may be caused by cultural practices, grafting, insects, etc. Once the bacteria have entered the plant, they occur intercellularly and stimulate surrounding tissue to proliferate due to cell transformation. Agrobacterium performs this control by inserting the plasmid T-DNA into the plant's genome. See above for more details about the process of plasmid DNA insertion into the host genome. Excess growth of the plant tissue leads to gall formation on the stem and roots. These tumors exert significant pressure on the surrounding plant tissue, which causes this tissue to become crushed and/or distorted. The crushed vessels lead to reduced water flow in the xylem. Young tumors are soft and therefore vulnerable to secondary invasion by insects and saprophytic microorganisms. This secondary invasion causes the breakdown of the peripheral cell layers as well as tumor discoloration due to decay. Breakdown of the soft tissue leads to release of the Agrobacterium tumefaciens into the soil allowing it to restart the disease process with a new host plant.\n\nDisease management[edit]\nCrown gall disease caused by Agrobacterium tumefaciens can be controlled by using various methods. The best way to control this disease is to take preventative measures, such as sterilizing pruning tools so as to avoid infecting new plants. Performing mandatory inspections of nursery stock and rejecting infected plants as well as not planting susceptible plants in infected fields are also valuable practices. Avoiding wounding the crowns/roots of the plants during cultivation is important for preventing disease. In horticultural techniques in which multiple plants are joined to grow as one, such as budding and grafting these techniques lead to plant wounds. Wounds are the primary location of bacterial entry into the host plant. Therefore, it is advisable to perform these techniques during times of the year when Agrobacteria are not active. Control of root-chewing insects is also helpful to reduce levels of infection, since these insects cause wounds (aka bacterial entryways) in the plant roots. It is recommended that infected plant material be burned rather than placed in a compost pile due to the bacteria's ability to live in the soil for many years.\nBiological control methods are also utilized in managing this disease. During the 1970s and 1980s, a common practice for treating germinated seeds, seedlings, and rootstock was to soak them in a suspension of K84. K84 is composed of A. radiobacter, which is a species related to A. tumefaciens but is not pathogenic. K84 produces a bacteriocin (agrocin 84) which is an antibiotic specific against related bacteria, including A. tumefaciens. This method, which was successful at controlling the disease on a commercial scale, had the risk of K84 transferring its resistance gene to the pathogenic Agrobacteria. Thus, in the 1990s, the use of a genetically engineering strain of K84, known as K-1026, was created. This strain is just as successful in controlling crown gall as K84 without the caveat of resistance gene transfer.\n\nEnvironment[edit]\nCrown gall of sunflower caused by A. tumefaciens\nHost, environment, and pathogen are extremely important concepts in regards to plant pathology. Agrobacteria have the widest host range of any plant pathogen, so the main factor to take into consideration in the case of crown gall is environment. There are various conditions and factors that make for a conducive environment for A. tumefaciens when infecting its various hosts. The bacterium can't penetrate the host plant without an entry point such as a wound. Factors leading to wounds in plants include cultural practices, grafting, freezing injury, growth cracks, soil insects, and other animals in the environment causing damage to the plant. Consequently, in exceptionally harsh winters, it is common to have an increased incidence of crown gall due to the weather-related damage. Along with this, there are methods of mediating infection of the host plant. For example, nematodes can act as a vector to introduce Agrobacterium into plant roots. More specifically, the root parasitic nematodes damage the plant cell, creating a wound for the bacteria to enter through. Finally, temperature is a factor when considering A. tumefaciens infection. The optimal temperature for crown gall formation due to this bacterium is 22\u00a0\u00b0C (72\u00a0\u00b0F) because of the thermosensitivity of T-DNA transfer. Tumor formation is significantly reduced at higher temperature conditions.\n\nSee also[edit]\nsuhB"

    "content": "\nCone cells or cones are photoreceptor cells in the retinas of vertebrates' eyes. They respond differently to light of different wavelengths, and the combination of their responses is responsible for color vision. Cones function best in relatively bright light, called the photopic region, as opposed to rod cells, which work better in dim light, or the scotopic region. Cone cells are densely packed in the fovea centralis, a 0.3\u00a0mm diameter rod-free area with very thin, densely packed cones which quickly reduce in number towards the periphery of the retina. Conversely, they are absent from the optic disc, contributing to the blind spot. There are about six to seven million cones in a human eye (vs ~92 million rods), with the highest concentration being towards the macula.\nCones are less sensitive to light than the rod cells in the retina (which support vision at low light levels), but allow the perception of color. They are also able to perceive finer detail and more rapid changes in images because their response times to stimuli are faster than those of rods. Cones are normally one of three types: S-cones, M-cones and L-cones. Each type expresses a different opsin: OPN1SW, OPN1MW, and OPN1LW, respectively. These cones are sensitive to visible wavelengths of light that correspond to short-wavelength, medium-wavelength and longer-wavelength light respectively. Because humans usually have three kinds of cones with different photopsins, which have different response curves and thus respond to variation in color in different ways, humans have trichromatic vision. Being color blind can change this, and there have been some verified reports of people with four types of cones, giving them tetrachromatic vision.\nThe three pigments responsible for detecting light have been shown to vary in their exact chemical composition due to genetic mutation; different individuals will have cones with different color sensitivity.\n\nStructure[edit]\nTypes[edit]\nHumans normally have three types of cones, usually designated L, M and S for long, medium and short wavelengths respectively. The first responds the most to light of the longer red wavelengths, peaking at about 560\u00a0nm. The majority of the human cones are of the long type. The second most common type responds the most to light of yellow to green medium-wavelength, peaking at 530\u00a0nm. M cones make up about a third of cones in the human eye. The third type responds the most to blue short-wavelength light, peaking at 420\u00a0nm, and make up only around 2% of the cones in the human retina. The three types have peak wavelengths in the range of 564\u2013580 nm, 534\u2013545\u00a0nm, and 420\u2013440\u00a0nm, respectively, depending on the individual. Such a difference is caused by the different opsins they carry, OPN1LW, OPN1MW, and OPN1SW, respectively, the forms of which affect the absorption of retinaldehyde. The CIE 1931 color space is an often-used model of spectral sensitivities of the three cells of an average human.\nWhile it has been discovered that there exists a mixed type of bipolar cells that bind to both rod and cone cells, bipolar cells still predominantly receive their input from cone cells.\nOther animals might have a different number of cone types (see Color vision).\nShape and arrangement[edit]\nCone cell structure\nCone cells are somewhat shorter than rods, but wider and tapered, and are much less numerous than rods in most parts of the retina, but greatly outnumber rods in the fovea. Structurally, cone cells have a cone-like shape at one end where a pigment filters incoming light, giving them their different response curves. They are typically 40\u201350 \u00b5m long, and their diameter varies from 0.5 to 4.0\u00a0\u00b5m, being smallest and most tightly packed at the center of the eye at the fovea. The S cone spacing is slightly larger than the others.\nPhotobleaching can be used to determine cone arrangement. This is done by exposing dark-adapted retina to a certain wavelength of light that paralyzes the particular type of cone sensitive to that wavelength for up to thirty minutes from being able to dark-adapt, making it appear white in contrast to the grey dark-adapted cones when a picture of the retina is taken. The results illustrate that S cones are randomly placed and appear much less frequently than the M and L cones. The ratio of M and L cones varies greatly among different people with regular vision (e.g. values of 75.8% L with 20.0% M versus 50.6% L with 44.2% M in two male subjects).\nLike rods, each cone cell has a synaptic terminal, inner and outer segments, as well as an interior nucleus and various mitochondria. The synaptic terminal forms a synapse with a neuron bipolar cell. The inner and outer segments are connected by a cilium. The inner segment contains organelles and the cell's nucleus, while the outer segment contains the light-absorbing materials.\nThe outer segments of cones have invaginations of their cell membranes that create stacks of membranous disks. Photopigments exist as transmembrane proteins within these disks, which provide more surface area for light to affect the pigments. In cones, these disks are attached to the outer membrane, whereas they are pinched off and exist separately in rods. Neither rods nor cones divide, but their membranous disks wear out and are worn off at the end of the outer segment, to be consumed and recycled by phagocytic cells.\n\nFunction[edit]\nBird, reptilian, and monotreme cone cells\nThe difference in the signals received from the three cone types allows the brain to perceive a continuous range of colors, through the opponent process of color vision. (Rod cells have a peak sensitivity at 498\u00a0nm, roughly halfway between the peak sensitivities of the S and M cones.)\nAll of the receptors contain the protein photopsin, with variations in its conformation causing differences in the optimum wavelengths absorbed.\nThe color yellow, for example, is perceived when the L cones are stimulated slightly more than the M cones, and the color red is perceived when the L cones are stimulated significantly more than the M cones. Similarly, blue and violet hues are perceived when the S receptor is stimulated more. S Cones are most sensitive to light at wavelengths around 420\u00a0nm. However, the lens and cornea of the human eye are increasingly absorptive to shorter wavelengths, and this sets the short wavelength limit of human-visible light to approximately 380\u00a0nm, which is therefore called 'ultraviolet' light. People with aphakia, a condition where the eye lacks a lens, sometimes report the ability to see into the ultraviolet range. At moderate to bright light levels where the cones function, the eye is more sensitive to yellowish-green light than other colors because this stimulates the two most common (M and L) of the three kinds of cones almost equally. At lower light levels, where only the rod cells function, the sensitivity is greatest at a blueish-green wavelength.\nCones also tend to possess a significantly elevated visual acuity because each cone cell has a lone connection to the optic nerve, therefore, the cones have an easier time telling that two stimuli are isolated. Separate connectivity is established in the\ninner plexiform layer so that each connection is parallel.\nThe response of cone cells to light is also directionally nonuniform, peaking at a direction that receives light from the center of the pupil; this effect is known as the Stiles\u2013Crawford effect.\nIt is possible that S cones may play a role in the regulation of the circadian system and the secretion of melatonin but this role is not clear yet. The exact contribution of S cone activation to circadian regulation is unclear but any potential role would be secondary to the better established role of melanopsin (see also Intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cell).\nColor afterimage[edit]\nSensitivity to a prolonged stimulation tends to decline over time, leading to neural adaptation. An interesting effect occurs when staring at a particular color for a minute or so. Such action leads to an exhaustion of the cone cells that respond to that color \u2013 resulting in the afterimage. This vivid color aftereffect can last for a minute or more.\n\nAssociated diseases[edit]\nAchromatopsia (Rod monochromacy) - a form of monochromacy with no functional cones\nBlue cone monochromacy - a rare form of monochromacy with only functional S-cones\nCongenital red\u2013green color blindness - partial color blindness include protanopia, deuteranopia, etc.\nOligocone trichromacy - poor visual acuity and impairment of cone function according to ERG, but without significant color vision loss.\nBradyopsia - photopic vision cannot respond quickly to stimuli.\nBornholm eye disease - X-linked recessive myopia, astigmatism, impaired visual acuity and red-green dichromacy.\nCone dystrophy - a degenerative loss of cone cells\nRetinoblastoma - a type of cancer originating from cone precursor cells\n\nSee also[edit]\nDisc shedding\nDouble cones\nRG color space\nTetrachromacy\nMelanopsin\nColor vision\nList of distinct cell types in the adult human body"

It's causing a widespread problem called **digital eye\nstrain** .\n\nSymptoms of digital eye strain include:\n\n* Eye fatigue and discomfort\n\n* [ Dry eyes ](/conditions/dryeye.htm \"Dry eyes\")\n\n* Headaches\n\n* Blurred vision\n\n* [ Red eyes ](/conditions/red-eyes.htm \"Red eyes\")\n\n* [ Eye twitching ](/conditions/eye-twitching.htm \"Eye twitching\")\n\n* Neck and shoulder pain\n\nResearch sponsored by The Vision Council showed that **59% of people** who\nroutinely use computers and digital devices experience symptoms of digital eye\nstrain (also known as **computer eye strain** or **computer vision syndrome**\n).\n\nHere are 10 easy steps you can take to reduce your risk of eye strain and the\nsymptoms that go along with it:\n\n##  1\\. Get a comprehensive eye exam.\n\nAn annual [ comprehensive eye exam ](/eye-exam/expect.htm \"comprehensive eye\nexam\") is the most important thing you can do to prevent or treat computer\nvision problems. During your exam, be sure to tell your eye doctor how often\nyou use a computer and digital devices at work and at home.\n\nMeasure how far your eyes are from your screen when you sit at your computer,\nand bring this measurement to your exam so your eye doctor can test your eyes\nat that specific working distance.\n\n**SEE RELATED:** [ How to choose an eye doctor ](/eye-doctor/choose.htm \"How\nto choose an eye doctor\")\n\n##  2\\. Use proper lighting.\n\nEye strain often is caused by excessively bright light either from outdoor\nsunlight coming in through a window or from harsh interior lighting.\n\nWhen you use a computer, your ambient lighting should be about half as bright\nas that typically found in most offices.\n\nEliminate exterior light by closing drapes, shades or blinds. Reduce interior\nlighting by using fewer light bulbs or fluorescent tubes, or use lower\nintensity bulbs and tubes.\n\nAlso, if possible, position your computer screen so windows are to the side,\ninstead of in front or behind it.\n\nMany computer users find their eyes feel better if they can avoid working\nunder overhead fluorescent lights. If possible, turn off the overhead\nfluorescent lights in your office and use floor lamps that provide indirect\n\"soft white\" [ LED ](/eye-care/eye-health/can-led-lights-damage-your-eyes/\n\"LED\") lighting instead.\n\nSometimes switching to \"full spectrum\" fluorescent lighting that more closely\napproximates the light spectrum emitted by sunlight can be more comforting for\ncomputer work than regular fluorescent tubes. But even full spectrum lighting\ncan cause discomfort if it's too bright.\n\nTry reducing the number of fluorescent tubes installed above your computer\nworkspace if you are bothered by overhead lighting.\n\n##  3\\. Minimize glare.\n\nGlare from light reflecting off walls and finished surfaces, as well as\nreflections on your computer screen also can cause computer eye strain.\nConsider installing an anti-glare screen on your display and, if possible,\npaint bright white walls a darker color with a matte finish.\n\nIf you wear glasses, consider buying lenses with [ anti-reflective (AR)\ncoating ](/lenses/anti-reflective.htm \"anti-reflective \\(AR\\) coating\") . AR\ncoating reduces glare by minimizing the amount of light reflecting off the\nfront and back surfaces of your eyeglass lenses.\n\n##  4\\. Upgrade your display.\n\nIf you have not already done so, replace your old tube-style monitor (called a\ncathode ray tube or CRT) with a flat-panel LED (light-emitting diode) screen\nwith an anti-reflective surface.\n\nOld-fashioned CRT screens can cause a noticeable \"flicker\" of images, which is\na major cause of computer eye strain. Even if this flicker is imperceptible,\nit still can contribute to eye strain and fatigue during computer work.\n\n![](https://images.ctfassets.net/u4vv676b8z52/3D2E87KVOxDe7FgoADAgDU/2030acdf745ddf77bde527c4b467a613/Small-\nArticle-EyeStrain-Woman-compressor.jpg?fm=jpg&q=80)\n\nTo ease eye strain, make sure you use good lighting and sit at a proper\ndistance from the computer screen.\n\nComplications due to flicker are even more likely if the refresh rate of the\nmonitor is less than 75 hertz (Hz). If you must use a CRT at work, adjust the\ndisplay settings to the highest possible refresh rate.\n\nWhen choosing a new flat panel display, select a screen with the highest\nresolution possible. Resolution is related to the \"dot pitch\" of the display.\nGenerally, displays with a lower dot pitch have sharper images. Choose a\ndisplay with a dot pitch of .28 mm or smaller.\n\nAlso, choose a relatively large display. For a desktop computer, select a\ndisplay that has a diagonal screen size of at least 19 inches.\n\n##  5\\. Adjust your computer display settings.\n\nAdjusting the display settings of your computer can help reduce eye strain and\nfatigue. Generally, these adjustments are beneficial:\n\n* **Brightness:** Adjust the brightness of the display so it's approximately the same as the brightness of your surrounding workstation. As a test, look at the white background of this Web page. If it looks like a light source, it's too bright. If it seems dull and gray, it may be too dark.\n\n* **Text size and contrast:** Adjust the text size and contrast for comfort, especially when reading or composing long documents. Usually, black print on a white background is the best combination for comfort.\n\n* **Color temperature:** This is a technical term used to describe the spectrum of visible light emitted by a color display. Of the different colors of visible light, blue light is the highest energy. Reducing the color temperature of your display lowers the amount of blue light emitted by a color display for better long-term viewing comfort.\n\n**SEE RELATED:** [ Blue light facts ](blue-light.htm \"Blue light facts\")\n\n##  6\\. Blink more often.\n\nBlinking is very important when working at a computer; it moistens your eyes\nto prevent dryness and irritation.\n\nWhen staring at a screen, people blink less frequently \u2014 only about one-third\nas often as they normally do \u2014 and many blinks performed during computer work\nare only partial lid closures, according to studies.\n\nTears coating the [ eye ](/resources/anatomy.htm \"eye\") evaporate more rapidly\nduring long non-blinking phases and this can cause dry eyes. Also, the air in\nmany office environments is dry, which can increase how quickly your tears\nevaporate, placing you at greater risk for dry eye problems.\n\nIf you experience dry eye symptoms, ask your eye doctor about artificial tears\nfor use during the day.\n\nBy the way, don't confuse [ lubricating eye drops ](/buysmart/eye-drops.htm\n\"lubricating eye drops\") with the drops formulated to \"get the red out.\" The\nlatter can indeed make your eyes look better \u2014 they contain ingredients that\nreduce the size of blood vessels on the surface of your eyes to \"whiten\" them.\nBut they are not necessarily formulated to reduce dryness and irritation.\n\nTo reduce your risk of [ dry eyes during computer use ](/askdoc/dry-eyes.htm\n\"dry eyes during computer use\") , try this exercise: Every 20 minutes, blink\n10 times by closing your eyes as if falling asleep (very slowly). This will\nhelp rewet your eyes.\n\n**READ MORE:** [ How many times do we blink in a day? ](/eye-care/eye-\nanatomy/how-many-times-we-blink-per-day/ \"How many times do we blink in a\nday?\")\n\n##  7\\. Exercise your eyes.\n\n![](https://images.ctfassets.net/u4vv676b8z52/38LJtKrZbwrI1l1ix1zsgs/fc5f81c77be02080d8bd20810e2c13ea/20-20-20-rule-660x500.gif)\n\nAnother cause of computer eye strain is focusing fatigue. To reduce your risk\nof tiring your eyes by constantly focusing on your screen, look away from your\ncomputer at least every 20 minutes and gaze at a distant object (at least 20\nfeet away) for at least 20 seconds.\n\nSome eye doctors call this the \" [ 20-20-20 rule ](/conditions/refractive-\nerrors/what-is-20-20-20-rule/ \"20-20-20 rule\") .\" Looking far away relaxes the\nfocusing muscle inside the eye to reduce fatigue.\n\nAnother exercise is to look far away at an object for 10-15 seconds, then gaze\nat something up close for 10-15 seconds. Then look back at the distant object.\nDo this 10 times. This exercise reduces the risk of your eyes' focusing\nability to \"lock up\" (a condition called accommodative spasm) after prolonged\ncomputer work.\n\nBoth of these exercises will reduce your risk of computer eye strain. Also,\nremember to blink frequently during the exercises to reduce your risk of\ncomputer-related dry eye.\n\n##  8\\. Take frequent breaks.\n\nTo reduce your risk for computer vision syndrome and neck, back and shoulder\npain, take frequent screen breaks during your work day (at least one 10-minute\nbreak every hour).\n\nDuring these breaks, stand up, move about and stretch your arms, legs, back,\nneck and shoulders to reduce tension and muscle fatigue.\n\n##  9\\. Modify your workstation.\n\nIf you need to look back and forth between a printed page and your computer\nscreen, place the written pages on a copy stand adjacent to your screen.\n\nLight the copy stand properly. You may want to use a desk lamp, but make sure\nit doesn't shine into your eyes or onto your computer screen.\n\nPoor posture also contributes to computer vision syndrome. Adjust your\nworkstation and chair to the correct height so your feet rest comfortably on\nthe floor.\n\nPosition your computer screen so it's 20 to 24 inches from your eyes. The\ncenter of your screen should be about 10 to 15 degrees below your eyes for\ncomfortable positioning of your head and neck.\n\n##  10\\. Consider computer glasses.\n\nFor the greatest comfort at your computer, you might benefit from having your\neye doctor modify your [ eyeglasses ](/eyeglasses/ \"eyeglasses\") prescription\nto create customized computer glasses.\n\nThis is especially true if you normally wear [ contact lenses ](/contacts/\n\"contact lenses\") , which may become dry and uncomfortable during extended\nscreen time.\n\nComputer glasses also are a good choice if you wear [ bifocals\n](/lenses/multifocal.htm \"bifocals\") or [ progressive lenses\n](/lenses/progressives.htm \"progressive lenses\") , because these lenses\ngenerally are not optimal for the distance to your computer screen.\n\nAlso, you may want to consider [ photochromic lenses\n](/lenses/photochromic.htm \"photochromic lenses\") or lightly tinted lenses for\ncomputer eyewear to reduce your exposure to [ blue light ](blue-light.htm\n\"blue light\") emitted by digital devices. Ask your eye doctor for details and\nadvice.\n\n**READ MORE:** [ How computer glasses can help computer vision syndrome ](./\n\"How computer glasses can help computer vision syndrome\")\n\n##  Notes and References\n\nBlink rate, blink amplitude, and tear film integrity during dynamic visual\ndisplay terminal tasks. _Current Eye Research_ .

In bacterial and plant cells, a cell wall is attached to the\nplasma membrane on its outside surface. The plasma membrane consists of a\nlipid bilayer that is semipermeable. The plasma membrane regulates the\ntransport of materials entering and exiting the cell.\n\n  \n  \n\n##  Narration\n\nThe plasma membrane, or the cell membrane, provides protection for a cell. It\nalso provides a fixed environment inside the cell. And that membrane has\nseveral different functions. One is to transport nutrients into the cell and\nalso to transport toxic substances out of the cell. Another is that the\nmembrane of the cell, which would be the plasma membrane, will have proteins\non it which interact with other cells. Those proteins can be glycoprotein,\nmeaning there's a sugar and a protein moiety, or they could be lipid proteins,\nmeaning there's a fat and a protein. And those proteins which stick outside of\nthe plasma membrane will allow for one cell to interact with another cell. The\ncell membrane also provides some structural support for a cell. And there are\ndifferent types of plasma membranes in different types of cells, and the\nplasma membrane has in it in general a lot of cholesterol as its lipid\ncomponent. That's different from certain other membranes within the cell. Now,\nthere are different plants and different microbes, such as bacteria and algae,\nwhich have different protective mechanisms. In fact, they have a cell wall\noutside of them, and that cell wall is much tougher and is structurally more\nsound than a plasma membrane is.\n\n##  Search\n\nBack to Glossary\n\n##  Related\n\nOrganelle\n\nNuclear Membrane\n\nBacteria\n\nCell\n\n###  Get Updates\n\nEnter your email address to receive updates about the latest advances in\ngenomics research.\n\nSubscribe\n\n###  Social Media Stream\n\n##  Footer Links\n\n  * Contact \n  * Accessibility \n  * Site Map \n  * Staff Search \n  * Plug-Ins Used by HHS \n  * FOIA \n  * Privacy \n  * Copyright \n  * HHS Vulnerability Disclosure \n\n"

Museum\n\nA new study reveals that 65 plant species have gone extinct in the continental\nUnited States and Canada since European settlement, more extinctions than any\nprevious scientific study has ever documented.\n\nLed by Wesley Knapp of the North Carolina Natural Heritage Program, a group of\n16 experts from across the United States \u2014 including [ Richard Olmstead\n](https://www.biology.washington.edu/people/profile/richard-olmstead) , a\nUniversity of Washington professor of biology and curator of the UW\u2019s [ Burke\nMuseum Herbarium ](https://www.burkemuseum.org/collections-and-\nresearch/biology/plants-and-fungi) \u2014 collaborated on this first-of-its-kind\nproject to document the extinct plants of the continental United States and\nCanada. Their findings [ were published\n](https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/cobi.13621) Aug. 28\nin Conservation Biology.\n\n[ ![A photograph of a museum specimen of a now-extinct plant\nspecies.](https://uw-s3-cdn.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/sites/6/2020/11/24105237/Astragalus-kentrophyta-\nvar.-douglasii_Courtesy-NY-Botanic-Gardens-200x300.jpg)\n](https://uw-s3-cdn.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/sites/6/2020/11/24105237/Astragalus-kentrophyta-\nvar.-douglasii_Courtesy-NY-Botanic-Gardens.jpg)\n\n_Astragalus kentrophyta var. douglasii_ , or thistle milk-vetch, is one of two\nWashington-specific extinct species identified in this study.  New York\nBotanical Garden\n\nThe team found that most plant extinctions occurred in the western United\nStates, where the vegetation was minimally documented before widespread\nEuropean settlement. Since many extinctions likely occurred before scientists\nanalyzed an area, it is likely the 65 documented extinctions underestimate the\nactual number of plant species that have been lost. Previous studies\ndocumented far fewer plant extinctions on the North American continent.\n\nIn Washington state, the team found two confirmed extinctions: the thistle\nmilk-vetch, or [ _Astragalus kentrophyta_ var. _douglasii_\n](https://biology.burke.washington.edu/herbarium/imagecollection/taxon.php?Taxon=Astragalus%20kentrophyta)\n, and the pale bugseed, or [ _Corispermum pallidum_\n](https://biology.burke.washington.edu/herbarium/imagecollection/taxon.php?Taxon=Corispermum%20pallidum)\n. While neither of these Eastern Washington species were ever abundant, their\ndisappearance is likely due to the human impact of changing land use. This has\nalso dramatically reduced the populations of countless other species, many of\nwhich are likely to follow these into extinction, unless efforts to protect\nwhat remains of native habitat are stepped up.\n\n[ ![An image of a museum specimen of a now-extinct plant species from\nWashington state.](https://uw-s3-cdn.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/sites/6/2020/11/24105547/Corispermum-pallidum-200x300.jpg)\n](https://uw-s3-cdn.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/sites/6/2020/11/24105547/Corispermum-pallidum.jpg)\n\n_Corispermum pallidum_ , or pale bugseed, is one of two Washington-specific\nextinct species identified in this study.  Burke Museum\n\n\u201cPreventing extinction is the lowest bar for conservation success we can set,\nyet we are not always successful,\u201d said Knapp. \u201cThis study started as an\nacademic question but later developed into an opportunity to learn from what\nwe have lost. By studying the trends and patterns of plants that have already\ngone extinct, hopefully we can learn how to prevent plant extinction going\nforward.\u201d\n\nOf the 65 documented extinctions in the report, 64% were known only from a\nsingle location. While conservation often focuses on protecting entire\nlandscapes, this finding points to the importance of small-scale site\nprotection to prevent extinctions. Extinct species are still being described\nfrom old herbarium specimens, underscoring the importance of continued\ndocumentation of the flora and supporting museum collections like the [ Burke\nHerbarium ](https://www.burkemuseum.org/news/plant-extinction-more-common-\npreviously-realized) . _Corispermum pallidum_ , one of the species extinct in\nWashington, was first collected in 1893. Yet the species wasn\u2019t formally\n\u201cdiscovered\u201d until much later when it was first described as a new species\nposthumously in 1995. Only a handful of herbarium specimens exist today. The\nBurke has three, including one of the two collections from 1893 and the last\nknown collection from 1931.\n\n\u201cThere is no living memory of either of these species today,\u201d Olmstead said.\n\u201cHerbarium collections record our flora as it was historically and provide\ndocumentation of change, and loss, over time, whether through direct human\nimpact, or indirectly through climate change and the impact it will have on\nplants. Documenting extinction is difficult, but herbarium records can say\nwhere and when a species was last observed and guide the search for surviving\nmembers.\u201d\n\nThis work also highlights the need for collaborative science in addressing\nlarge-scale conservation issues. The team of 16 botanists from across the\nUnited States includes experts with state and federal government agencies,\nnumerous botanical gardens, museums, nonprofit organizations, regional\nconservation groups and academic institutions. To answer the overarching\nquestion of what exists and where, the team of experts cross-checked thousands\nof records to ensure accuracy, discovering that botanical gardens occasionally\nharbored the last of an extremely rare species and may not have been aware of\nit.\n\nPlants serve as the foundation for most terrestrial ecosystems.

Often,\nphotos of these bizarre light shows come with wild speculation about what\ncaused them, from aliens to secret military weapons.\n\nBut unfortunately for conspiracy theorists, there is always a more Earthly\nscientific explanation for these luminous displays. From  UFO  -like rings to\nblood-red arcs, here are 10 bizarre atmospheric light shows with a\nsurprisingly simple explanation.\n\n##  Eerie UFO-like ring\n\nA halo of red light briefly appeared in the night sky above a town in Italy.\n(Image credit: Valter Binotto)\n\nThis bizarre disk of red light appeared to  briefly flash above the town of\nPossagno in northern Italy  , hanging in the sky for just a few milliseconds\nbefore abruptly vanishing.\n\nThe fluorescent frisbee is known as an \"emission of light and very low-\nfrequency perturbations due to electromagnetic pulse sources,\" or elve It's an\natmospheric disturbance created when  lightning  produces an electromagnetic\npulse that hits Earth's ionosphere \u2014 the ionized part of the upper atmosphere\nthat stretches between 50 and 400 miles (80 and 650 kilometers) above the\nground. The red color is given off by excited nitrogen atoms in the\nionosphere.\n\nThis luminous halo appeared during an intense thunderstorm around 175 miles\n(280 km) southeast of Possagno. But forced perspective made the massive ring,\nwhich had a diameter of around 225 miles (360 km), seemingly hang above the\ntown.\n\n##  Light arcs and halos\n\nThe sun surrounded by shining halos and arcs of light.  (Image credit: Alan\nFitzsimmons)\n\nThis photo, which was captured by an astronomer at Queen's University Belfast\nin Northern Ireland, shows a  spectacular set of luminous arcs and halos\nshining around the sun  .\n\nEthereal lights like these are created by sunlight shining through millions of\ntiny, perfectly positioned ice crystals in the upper atmosphere. The miniature\nhexagonal crystals refract light similarly to a prism, and when strong winds\norient them in the same direction, the light they warp combines to produce\nlines of light.\n\nThe image shows at least three different optical phenomena: a 22-degree halo,\nwhich is the large circle surrounding  the sun  ; a pair of \"sundogs\" \u2014 the\nbright points on each side of the 22-degree halo; and a complete parhelic\ncircle \u2014 the line that bisects the circle \u2014 which is the rarest of this type\nof phenomenon. The image may also include features of a circumscribed halo and\na supralateral arc, which form the \"eyelids\" above and below the 22-degree\nhalo.\n\nIndividually, all these phenomena can be relatively common, but seeing them\nall together at once is extremely rare.\n\n##  Bizarre blue blobs\n\nThis photo taken from the ISS above the South China Sea shows a pair of\nunrelated bright blue blobs in Earth's atmosphere.  (Image credit: NASA Earth\nObservatory)\n\nAn astronaut on board the International Space Station (ISS) snapped this image\nof  two bizarre blue blobs of light glimmering in our planet's atmosphere  .\nIntriguingly, the two blobs are completely unrelated to one another and just\nhappened to occur at the same time.\n\nThe light blob at the bottom of the image,is a massive lightning strike that\noccurred next to a large, circular gap in the top of the clouds. This caused\nthe lightning to illuminate the surrounding walls of the cloudy caldera-like\nstructure, creating a striking luminous ring.\n\nThe blue blob in the top right of the image is the result of warped light from\nthe moon  . The moon's orientation in relation to the ISS meant the light it\nreflected back from the sun passed through the planet's atmosphere,\ntransforming it into a bright blue blob with a fuzzy halo.\n\n##  Ethereal whirlpool of light\n\nA blue spiral of light outshines auroras in Alaska.  (Image credit: Todd\nSalat/AuroraHunter.com)\n\nThis ethereal whirlpool of blue light  appeared in the night sky above Alaska\n, briefly stealing the limelight from a strong auroral display. But the\nbizarre, spiral-shaped object had nothing to do with the dancing polar lights.\n\nThe luminous spiral was made from frozen rocket fuel that was ejected by the\nfast-spinning, detached second stage of one of SpaceX's Falcon 9 rockets. Due\nto its high altitude, the frozen fuel reflected sunlight back to Earth, making\nit stand out in the night sky. Lights like these can last for several minutes\nbefore the frozen fuel crystals disperse.\n\nA similar spiral was also filmed  forming and then disappearing in the night\nsky above Hawaii  . Astronomers have nicknamed the swirling light \"SpaceX\nspirals\" and believe they will become more common as the number of SpaceX\nlaunches increases.\n\n##  Blood-red arc\n\nA hazy river of red light hangs in the sky above Denmark.  (Image credit:\nRuslan Merzlyakov)\n\nA bright red streak of light  appeared in the sky above parts of Scandinavia\nafter a powerful solar storm slammed into Earth. But the bright red band was\nnot an  aurora  \u2014 it was something much rarer.\n\nThe unusual phenomenon is known as a stable auroral red arc (SAR) \u2014 but\ndespite the name, it is neither an aurora nor particularly stable. Unlike\nauroras, which appear when solar radiation excites gas molecules in the upper\natmosphere, SARs form when atmospheric gas is superheated by Earth's ring\ncurrent system \u2014 a massive loop of electric current that surrounds our planet.\nBoth phenomena become more likely after solar storms weaken Earth's\nmagnetosphere.\n\nFor unknown reasons, only oxygen is heated up during a SAR, which means these\nphenomena always emit the same shade of red.\n\n##  Rainbow clouds\n\nThese bizarre rainbow-colored clouds appeared during the night in the Arctic.\n(Image credit: J\u00f3n\u00edna Gu\u00f0r\u00fan \u00d3skarsd\u00f3ttir)\n\nThese multicolored clouds were  spotted shining in the night sky above the\nArctic  .\n\nThe clouds, known as polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs), only form in the\nstratosphere \u2014 the second layer of Earth's atmosphere \u2014 at temperatures below\nminus 114 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 81 degrees Celsius). Normally, the\nstratosphere is too dry for clouds to form, but at extremely low temperatures,\nwidely spaced water molecules begin to coalesce into tiny ice crystals that\nbecome clouds.\n\nAs sunlight shines through these crystal clouds, it gets scattered, creating\nmultiple different wavelengths of light, which gives the clouds their rainbow\ncolors. Due to the extreme altitude of the clouds, sunlight can hit the\ncrystals and scatter above an observer even if the sun is beyond the horizon,\nwhich is when these clouds appear brightest.\n\n##  Bright green laser lines\n\nA time-lapse image of the green laser pulses flashing across the night sky in\nHawaii.  (Image credit: National Observatory of Japan)\n\nThis image, which was captured by a telescope on Hawaii's tallest peak, Mauna\nKea, shows  bright green laser lines flashing across the night sky  .\n\nThe lines, which appeared one after the other, only lasted for around a\nsecond. But they inspired online comparisons with \"digital rain,\" or the lines\nof green computer code that fall vertically down the screen during the\n\"Matrix\" movies.\n\nBut these lines aren't evidence we are living in the matrix. Instead, they\ncame from lasers fired from NASA's ICESat-2 satellite, which measures the\namount of ice in Earth's cryosphere \u2014 the part of Earth covered by solid\nprecipitation, including snow, sea ice, lake and river ice, icebergs,\nglaciers, ice sheets and ice shelves.\n\n##  Stunning STEVE\n\nA vibrant, purple STEVE cuts across the night sky above above Badlands\nNational Park in South Dakota.  (Image credit: Evan Ludes/Framed By Nature)\n\nThis bizarre, aurora-like streak of light, known as STEVE, was  spotted across\nseveral U.S. states in the wake of a major solar storm  in early 2023.\n\nSTEVE, or a \"strong thermal emission velocity enhancement,\" is a rare\nphenomenon that creates a solid ribbon of light that hangs in the air for up\nto an hour. The ribbon is created by a river of hot plasma, or ionized gas,\nthat breaks through Earth's weakened magnetosphere during solar storms. The\nflow of plasma is uniform and constant, which means the same gas remains\nexcited and continuously gives off the same light.\n\nSTEVE can occur much further away from Earth's poles than auroras tend to\nappear, although scientists are still unsure why.\n\n##  Shining rainbow rings\n\nThese rainbow rings spotted surrounding the sun in Finland had a surprising\norigin.  (Image credit: Mikko Peussa)\n\nSomething was in the air when this  image of concentric rainbow-colored rings\nwas snapped in Finland. And it turns out that something was pollen.\n\nMulticolored rings such as these, known as \"pollen coronas,\" form when\nsunlight scatters off thousands of pollen grains in the air. This creates a\ndiffraction pattern, in which individual wavelengths of light cancel each\nother out and only allow certain colors to be seen by the observer. Individual\ngrains are also illuminated and appear as bright spots in the image.\n\nThe pollen in the image comes from pine trees (  Pinus sylvestris  ), which\nhave air sacs that help them float (as well as making them look like Mickey\nMouse ears).\n\nPollen coronas only appear when pollen concentrations are very high and can\nonly be clearly seen when the sun or full moon is partially obscured.\n\n##  Bleeding sky\n\nA red streak of light appeared in the sky above Arizona shortly after a SpaceX\nrocket launch.  (Image credit: Jeremy Perez)\n\nA blood-red streak of light was  left behind in the sky above Arizona  after\none of SpaceX's Falcon 9 rockets punched a hole in Earth's ionosphere.\n\n\"Ionospheric holes\" are created when a rocket's second stage burns fuel\nbetween 125 and 185 miles (200 and 300 km) above Earth's surface. At this\nheight, the carbon dioxide and water vapor from the rocket's exhaust cause\nionized oxygen atoms to recombine or form back into diatomic oxygen molecules,\ncreating a gap in the plasma. This also excites the molecules and causes them\nto emit energy in the form of light.\n\nScientists have known about ionospheric holes for a while, but they are\nbecoming more common as the number of rocket launches increases. The holes\npose no threat to people on the surface, and they naturally close up within a\nfew hours as the recombined gases get re-ionized.\n\n##  Sign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now\n\nGet the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nContact me with news and offers from other Future brands  Receive email from\nus on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors  By submitting your\ninformation you agree to the  Terms & Conditions  and  Privacy Policy  and are\naged 16 or over.\n\nHarry Baker\n\nSocial Links Navigation\n\nSenior Staff Writer\n\nHarry is a U.K.-based senior staff writer at Live Science.

    "content": "\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS\u2011CoV\u20112) is a strain of coronavirus that causes COVID-19, the respiratory illness responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. The virus previously had the provisional name 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), and has also been called human coronavirus 2019 (HCoV-19 or hCoV-19).  First identified in the city of Wuhan, Hubei, China, the World Health Organization designated the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern from January 30, 2020, to May 5, 2023. SARS\u2011CoV\u20112 is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus that is contagious in humans.\nSARS\u2011CoV\u20112 is a strain of the species severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV), as is SARS-CoV-1, the virus that caused the 2002\u20132004 SARS outbreak. There are animal-borne coronavirus strains more closely related to SARS-CoV-2, the most closely related being bat coronaviruses, including BANAL-52 and RaTG13. The virus is of zoonotic origin; its close genetic similarity to bat coronaviruses suggests it emerged from a bat-borne virus. Research is ongoing as to whether SARS\u2011CoV\u20112 came directly from bats or indirectly through any intermediate hosts. The virus shows little genetic diversity, indicating that the spillover event introducing SARS\u2011CoV\u20112 to humans is likely to have occurred in late 2019.\nEpidemiological studies estimate that in the period between December 2019 and September 2020 each infection resulted in an average of 2.4\u20133.4 new infections when no members of the community were immune and no preventive measures were taken. However, some subsequent variants have become more infectious. The virus is airborne and primarily spreads between people through close contact and via aerosols and respiratory droplets that are exhaled when talking, breathing, or otherwise exhaling, as well as those produced from coughs and sneezes. It enters human cells by binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a membrane protein that regulates the renin\u2013angiotensin system.\n\nTerminology\nSign with provisional name \"2019-nCoV\"\nDuring the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, various names were used for the virus; some names used by different sources included \"the coronavirus\" or \"Wuhan coronavirus\". In January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended \"2019 novel coronavirus\" (2019-nCoV) as the provisional name for the virus. This was in accordance with WHO's 2015 guidance against using geographical locations, animal species, or groups of people in disease and virus names.\nOn 11 February 2020, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses adopted the official name \"severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2\" (SARS\u2011CoV\u20112). To avoid confusion with the disease SARS, the WHO sometimes refers to SARS\u2011CoV\u20112 as \"the COVID-19 virus\" in public health communications and the name HCoV-19 was included in some research articles. Referring to COVID-19 as the \"Wuhan virus\" has been described as dangerous by WHO officials, and as xenophobic by many journalists and academics.\n\nInfection and transmission\n\nMain article: Transmission of COVID-19\nThis section has multiple issues.

Transmission was initially assumed to occur primarily via respiratory droplets from coughs and sneezes within a range of about 1.8 metres (6\u00a0ft). Laser light scattering experiments suggest that speaking is an additional mode of transmission and a far-reaching one, indoors, with little air flow. Other studies have suggested that the virus may be airborne as well, with aerosols potentially being able to transmit the virus. During human-to-human transmission, between 200 and 800 infectious SARS\u2011CoV\u20112 virions are thought to initiate a new infection. If confirmed, aerosol transmission has biosafety implications because a major concern associated with the risk of working with emerging viruses in the laboratory is the generation of aerosols from various laboratory activities which are not immediately recognizable and may affect other scientific personnel. Indirect contact via contaminated surfaces is another possible cause of infection. Preliminary research indicates that the virus may remain viable on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304) for up to three days, but it does not survive on cardboard for more than one day or on copper for more than four hours. The virus is inactivated by soap, which destabilizes its lipid bilayer. Viral RNA has also been found in stool samples and semen from infected individuals.\nThe degree to which the virus is infectious during the incubation period is uncertain, but research has indicated that the pharynx reaches peak viral load approximately four days after infection or in the first week of symptoms and declines thereafter. The duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding is generally between 3 and 46 days after symptom onset.\nA study by a team of researchers from the University of North Carolina found that the nasal cavity is seemingly the dominant initial site of infection, with subsequent aspiration-mediated virus-seeding into the lungs in SARS\u2011CoV\u20112 pathogenesis. They found that there was an infection gradient from high in proximal towards low in distal pulmonary epithelial cultures, with a focal infection in ciliated cells and type 2 pneumocytes in the airway and alveolar regions respectively.\nStudies have identified a range of animals\u2014such as cats, ferrets, hamsters, non-human primates, minks, tree shrews, raccoon dogs, fruit bats, and rabbits\u2014that are susceptible and permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Some institutions have advised that those infected with SARS\u2011CoV\u20112 restrict their contact with animals.\nAsymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission\nOn 1\u00a0February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) indicated that \"transmission from asymptomatic cases is likely not a major driver of transmission\". One meta-analysis found that 17% of infections are asymptomatic, and asymptomatic individuals were 42% less likely to transmit the virus.\nHowever, an epidemiological model of the beginning of the outbreak in China suggested that \"pre-symptomatic shedding may be typical among documented infections\" and that subclinical infections may have been the source of a majority of infections. That may explain how out of 217 on board a cruise liner that docked at Montevideo, only 24 of 128 who tested positive for viral RNA showed symptoms. Similarly, a study of ninety-four patients hospitalized in January and February 2020 estimated patients began shedding virus two to three days before symptoms appear and that \"a substantial proportion of transmission probably occurred before first symptoms in the index case\". The authors later published a correction that showed that shedding began earlier than first estimated, four to five days before symptoms appear.\nReinfection\nThere is uncertainty about reinfection and long-term immunity. It is not known how common reinfection is, but reports have indicated that it is occurring with variable severity.\nThe first reported case of reinfection was a 33-year-old man from Hong Kong who first tested positive on 26 March 2020, was discharged on 15 April 2020 after two negative tests, and tested positive again on 15 August 2020 (142 days later), which was confirmed by whole-genome sequencing showing that the viral genomes between the episodes belong to different clades. The findings had the implications that herd immunity may not eliminate the virus if reinfection is not an uncommon occurrence and that vaccines may not be able to provide lifelong protection against the virus.\nAnother case study described a 25-year-old man from Nevada who tested positive for SARS\u2011CoV\u20112 on 18 April 2020 and on 5 June 2020 (separated by two negative tests). Since genomic analyses showed significant genetic differences between the SARS\u2011CoV\u20112 variant sampled on those two dates, the case study authors determined this was a reinfection. The man's second infection was symptomatically more severe than the first infection, but the mechanisms that could account for this are not known.\n\n\nReservoir and origin\n\nFurther information: Investigations into the origin of COVID-19\nTransmission of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS\u2011CoV\u20112 from mammals as biological carriers to humans\nNo natural reservoir for SARS-CoV-2 has been identified. Prior to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 as a pathogen infecting humans, there had been two previous zoonosis-based coronavirus epidemics, those caused by SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV.\nThe first known infections from SARS\u2011CoV\u20112 were discovered in Wuhan, China. The original source of viral transmission to humans remains unclear, as does whether the virus became pathogenic before or after the spillover event. Because many of the early infectees were workers at the Huanan Seafood Market, it has been suggested that the virus might have originated from the market. However, other research indicates that visitors may have introduced the virus to the market, which then facilitated rapid expansion of the infections. A March 2021 WHO-convened report stated that human spillover via an intermediate animal host was the most likely explanation, with direct spillover from bats next most likely. Introduction through the food supply chain and the Huanan Seafood Market was considered another possible, but less likely, explanation. An analysis in November 2021, however, said that the earliest-known case had been misidentified and that the preponderance of early cases linked to the Huanan Market argued for it being the source.\nFor a virus recently acquired through a cross-species transmission, rapid evolution is expected. The mutation rate estimated from early cases of SARS-CoV-2 was of 6.54\u00d710 per site per year. Coronaviruses in general have high genetic plasticity, but SARS-CoV-2's viral evolution is slowed by the RNA proofreading capability of its replication machinery. For comparison, the viral mutation rate in vivo of SARS-CoV-2 has been found to be lower than that of influenza.\nResearch into the natural reservoir of the virus that caused the 2002\u20132004 SARS outbreak has resulted in the discovery of many SARS-like bat coronaviruses, most originating in horseshoe bats. The closest match by far, published in Nature (journal) in February 2022, were viruses BANAL-52 (96.8% resemblance to SARS\u2011CoV\u20112), BANAL-103 and BANAL-236, collected in three different species of bats in Feuang, Laos. An earlier source published in February 2020 identified the virus RaTG13, collected in bats in Mojiang, Yunnan, China to be the closest to SARS\u2011CoV\u20112, with 96.1% resemblance. None of the above are its direct ancestor.\nSamples taken from Rhinolophus sinicus, a species of horseshoe bats, show an 80% resemblance to SARS\u2011CoV\u20112.\nBats are considered the most likely natural reservoir of SARS\u2011CoV\u20112. Differences between the bat coronavirus and SARS\u2011CoV\u20112 suggest that humans may have been infected via an intermediate host; although the source of introduction into humans remains unknown.\nAlthough the role of pangolins as an intermediate host was initially posited (a study published in July 2020 suggested that pangolins are an intermediate host of SARS\u2011CoV\u20112-like coronaviruses), subsequent studies have not substantiated their contribution to the spillover. Evidence against this hypothesis includes the fact that pangolin virus samples are too distant to SARS-CoV-2: isolates obtained from pangolins seized in Guangdong were only 92% identical in sequence to the SARS\u2011CoV\u20112 genome (matches above 90 percent may sound high, but in genomic terms it is a wide evolutionary gap). In addition, despite similarities in a few critical amino acids, pangolin virus samples exhibit poor binding to the human ACE2 receptor.\n\nPhylogenetics and taxonomy\nGenomic informationGenomic organisation of isolate Wuhan-Hu-1, the earliest sequenced sample of SARS-CoV-2NCBI genome ID86693Genome size29,903 basesYear of completion2020Genome browser (UCSC)\nSARS\u2011CoV\u20112 belongs to the broad family of viruses known as coronaviruses. It is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA (+ssRNA) virus, with a single linear RNA segment. Coronaviruses infect humans, other mammals, including livestock and companion animals, and avian species. Human coronaviruses are capable of causing illnesses ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, fatality rate ~34%). SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh known coronavirus to infect people, after 229E, NL63, OC43, HKU1, MERS-CoV, and the original SARS-CoV.\nLike the SARS-related coronavirus implicated in the 2003 SARS outbreak, SARS\u2011CoV\u20112 is a member of the subgenus Sarbecovirus (beta-CoV lineage B). Coronaviruses undergo frequent recombination. The mechanism of recombination in unsegmented RNA viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 is generally by copy-choice replication, in which gene material switches from one RNA template molecule to another during replication. The SARS-CoV-2 RNA sequence is approximately 30,000 bases in length, relatively long for a coronavirus\u2014which in turn carry the largest genomes among all RNA families. Its genome consists nearly entirely of protein-coding sequences, a trait shared with other coronaviruses.\nTransmission electron micrograph of SARS\u2011CoV\u20112 virions (red) isolated from a patient during the COVID-19 pandemic\nA distinguishing feature of SARS\u2011CoV\u20112 is its incorporation of a polybasic site cleaved by furin, which appears to be an important element enhancing its virulence. It was suggested that the acquisition of the furin-cleavage site in the SARS-CoV-2 S protein was essential for zoonotic transfer to humans. The furin protease recognizes the canonical peptide sequence RX[R/K] R\u2193X where the cleavage site is indicated by a down arrow and X is any amino acid. In SARS-CoV-2 the recognition site is formed by the incorporated 12 codon nucleotide sequence CCT CGG CGG GCA which corresponds to the amino acid sequence P RR A. This sequence is upstream of an arginine and serine which forms the S1/S2 cleavage site (P RR A R\u2193S) of the spike protein. Although such sites are a common naturally-occurring feature of other viruses within the Subfamily Orthocoronavirinae, it appears in few other viruses from the Beta-CoV genus, and it is unique among members of its subgenus for such a site. The furin cleavage site PRRAR\u2193 is highly similar to that of the feline coronavirus, an alphacoronavirus 1 strain.\nViral genetic sequence data can provide critical information about whether viruses separated by time and space are likely to be epidemiologically linked. With a sufficient number of sequenced genomes, it is possible to reconstruct a phylogenetic tree of the mutation history of a family of viruses. By 12 January 2020, five genomes of SARS\u2011CoV\u20112 had been isolated from Wuhan and reported by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CCDC) and other institutions; the number of genomes increased to 42 by 30 January 2020. A phylogenetic analysis of those samples showed they were \"highly related with at most seven mutations relative to a common ancestor\", implying that the first human infection occurred in November or December 2019. Examination of the topology of the phylogenetic tree at the start of the pandemic also found high similarities between human isolates.  As of 21\u00a0August\u00a02021, 3,422 SARS\u2011CoV\u20112 genomes, belonging to 19 strains, sampled on all continents except Antarctica were publicly available.\nOn 11 February 2020, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses announced that according to existing rules that compute hierarchical relationships among coronaviruses based on five conserved sequences of nucleic acids, the differences between what was then called 2019-nCoV and the virus from the 2003 SARS outbreak were insufficient to make them separate viral species. Therefore, they identified 2019-nCoV as a virus of Severe acute respiratory syndrome\u2013related coronavirus.\nIn July 2020, scientists reported that a more infectious SARS\u2011CoV\u20112 variant with spike protein variant G614 has replaced D614 as the dominant form in the pandemic.\nCoronavirus genomes and subgenomes encode six open reading frames (ORFs). In October 2020, researchers discovered a possible overlapping gene named ORF3d, in the SARS\u2011CoV\u20112 genome. It is unknown if the protein produced by ORF3d has any function, but it provokes a strong immune response. ORF3d has been identified before, in a variant of coronavirus that infects pangolins.\nPhylogenetic tree\nA phylogenetic tree based on whole-genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 and related coronaviruses is:\nSARS\u2011CoV\u20112\u00a0related\u00a0coronavirus\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Bat) Rc-o319, 81% to SARS-CoV-2, Rhinolophus cornutus, Iwate, Japan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBat SL-ZXC21, 88% to SARS-CoV-2, Rhinolophus pusillus, Zhoushan, Zhejiang\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBat SL-ZC45, 88% to SARS-CoV-2, Rhinolophus pusillus, Zhoushan, Zhejiang\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPangolin SARSr-CoV-GX, 85.3% to SARS-CoV-2, Manis javanica, smuggled from Southeast Asia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPangolin SARSr-CoV-GD, 90.1% to SARS-CoV-2, Manis javanica, smuggled from Southeast Asia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBat RshSTT182, 92.6% to SARS-CoV-2, Rhinolophus shameli, Steung Treng, Cambodia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBat RshSTT200, 92.6% to SARS-CoV-2, Rhinolophus shameli, Steung Treng, Cambodia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Bat) RacCS203, 91.5% to SARS-CoV-2, Rhinolophus acuminatus, Chachoengsao, Thailand\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Bat) RmYN02, 93.3% to SARS-CoV-2, Rhinolophus malayanus, Mengla, Yunnan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Bat) RpYN06, 94.4% to SARS-CoV-2, Rhinolophus pusillus, Xishuangbanna, Yunnan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Bat) RaTG13, 96.1% to SARS-CoV-2, Rhinolophus affinis, Mojiang, Yunnan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Bat) BANAL-52, 96.8% to SARS-CoV-2, Rhinolophus malayanus, Vientiane, Laos\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSARS-CoV-2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSARS-CoV-1, 79% to SARS-CoV-2\n\nVariants\n\nMain article: Variants of SARS-CoV-2\n\nThis section needs to be updated. Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. (April 2023)\nFalse-colour transmission electron micrograph of a B.1.1.7 variant coronavirus. The variant's increased transmissibility is believed to be due to changes in the structure of the spike proteins, shown here in green.\nThere are many thousands of variants of SARS-CoV-2, which can be grouped into the much larger clades. Several different clade nomenclatures have been proposed. Nextstrain divides the variants into five clades (19A, 19B, 20A, 20B, and 20C), while GISAID divides them into seven (L, O, V, S, G, GH, and GR).\nSeveral notable variants of SARS-CoV-2 emerged in late 2020. The World Health Organization has currently declared five variants of concern, which are as follows:\nAlpha: Lineage B.1.1.7 emerged in the United Kingdom in September 2020, with evidence of increased transmissibility and virulence. Notable mutations include N501Y and P681H.\nAn E484K mutation in some lineage B.1.1.7 virions has been noted and is also tracked by various public health agencies.\nBeta: Lineage B.1.351 emerged in South Africa in May 2020, with evidence of increased transmissibility and changes to antigenicity, with some public health officials raising alarms about its impact on the efficacy of some vaccines. Notable mutations include K417N, E484K and N501Y.\nGamma: Lineage P.1 emerged in Brazil in November 2020, also with evidence of increased transmissibility and virulence, alongside changes to antigenicity. Similar concerns about vaccine efficacy have been raised. Notable mutations also include K417N, E484K and N501Y.\nDelta: Lineage B.1.617.2 emerged in India in October 2020. There is also evidence of increased transmissibility and changes to antigenicity.\nOmicron: Lineage B.1.1.529 emerged in Botswana in November 2021.\nOther notable variants include 6 other WHO-designated variants under investigation and Cluster 5, which emerged among mink in Denmark and resulted in a mink euthanasia campaign rendering it virtually extinct.\n\nVirology\nVirus structure\nStructure of a SARSr-CoV virion\nEach SARS-CoV-2 virion is 60\u2013140 nanometres (2.4\u00d710\u20135.5\u00d710\u00a0in) in diameter; its mass within the global human populace has been estimated as being between 0.1 and 10 kilograms. Like other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 has four structural proteins, known as the S (spike), E (envelope), M (membrane), and N (nucleocapsid) proteins; the N protein holds the RNA genome, and the S, E, and M proteins together create the viral envelope. Coronavirus S proteins are glycoproteins and also type I membrane proteins (membranes containing a single transmembrane domain oriented on the extracellular side). They are divided into two functional parts (S1 and S2). In SARS-CoV-2, the spike protein, which has been imaged at the atomic level using cryogenic electron microscopy, is the protein responsible for allowing the virus to attach to and fuse with the membrane of a host cell; specifically, its S1 subunit catalyzes attachment, the S2 subunit fusion.\nSARS\u2011CoV\u20112 spike homotrimer with one protein subunit highlighted. The ACE2 binding domain is magenta.\nGenome\nAs of early 2022, about 7 million SARS-CoV-2 genomes had been sequenced and deposited into public databases and another 800,000 or so were added each month. By September 2023, the GISAID EpiCoV database contained more than 16 million genome sequences.\nSARS-CoV-2 has a linear, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome about 30,000 bases long. Its genome has a bias against cytosine (C) and guanine (G) nucleotides, like other coronaviruses. The genome has the highest composition of U (32.2%), followed by A (29.9%), and a similar composition of G (19.6%) and C (18.3%). The nucleotide bias arises from the mutation of guanines and cytosines to adenosines and uracils, respectively. The mutation of CG dinucleotides is thought to arise to avoid the zinc finger antiviral protein related defense mechanism of cells, and to lower the energy to unbind the genome during replication and translation (adenosine and uracil base pair via two hydrogen bonds, cytosine and guanine via three). The depletion of CG dinucleotides in its genome has led the virus to have a noticeable codon usage bias. For instance, arginine's six different codons have a relative synonymous codon usage of AGA (2.67), CGU (1.46), AGG (.81), CGC (.58), CGA (.29), and CGG (.19). A similar codon usage bias trend is seen in other SARS\u2013related coronaviruses.\nReplication cycle\nVirus infections start when viral particles bind to host surface cellular receptors. Protein modeling experiments on the spike protein of the virus soon suggested that SARS\u2011CoV\u20112 has sufficient affinity to the receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on human cells to use them as a mechanism of cell entry. By 22 January 2020, a group in China working with the full virus genome and a group in the United States using reverse genetics methods independently and experimentally demonstrated that ACE2 could act as the receptor for SARS\u2011CoV\u20112. Studies have shown that SARS\u2011CoV\u20112 has a higher affinity to human ACE2 than the original SARS virus. SARS\u2011CoV\u20112 may also use basigin to assist in cell entry.\nInitial spike protein priming by transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2) is essential for entry of SARS\u2011CoV\u20112. The host protein neuropilin 1 (NRP1) may aid the virus in host cell entry using ACE2. After a SARS\u2011CoV\u20112 virion attaches to a target cell, the cell's TMPRSS2 cuts open the spike protein of the virus, exposing a fusion peptide in the S2 subunit, and the host receptor ACE2. After fusion, an endosome forms around the virion, separating it from the rest of the host cell. The virion escapes when the pH of the endosome drops or when cathepsin, a host cysteine protease, cleaves it. The virion then releases RNA into the cell and forces the cell to produce and disseminate copies of the virus, which infect more cells.\nSARS\u2011CoV\u20112 produces at least three virulence factors that promote shedding of new virions from host cells and inhibit immune response. Whether they include downregulation of ACE2, as seen in similar coronaviruses, remains under investigation (as of May 2020).\nDigitally colourised scanning electron micrographs of SARS-CoV-2 virions (yellow) emerging from human cells cultured in a laboratory\n\nTreatment and drug development\nVery few drugs are known to effectively inhibit SARS\u2011CoV\u20112. Masitinib is a clinically safe drug and was recently found to inhibit its main protease, 3CLpro and showed >200-fold reduction in viral titers in the lungs and nose in mice. However, it is not approved for the treatment of COVID-19 in humans as of August 2021.  In December 2021, the United States granted emergency use authorization to Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir for the treatment of the virus; the European Union, United Kingdom, and Canada followed suit with full authorization soon after.  One study found that Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir reduced the risk of hospitalization and death by 88%.\nCOVID Moonshot is an international collaborative open-science project started in March 2020 with the goal of developing an un-patented oral antiviral drug for treatment of SARS-CoV-2.\n\nEpidemiology\n\nMain article: COVID-19 pandemic\nRetrospective tests collected within the Chinese surveillance system revealed no clear indication of substantial unrecognized circulation of SARS\u2011CoV\u20112 in Wuhan during the latter part of 2019.\nA meta-analysis from November 2020 estimated the basic reproduction number (\n\n\n\n\nR\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle R_{0}}\n\n) of the virus to be between 2.39 and 3.44. This means each infection from the virus is expected to result in 2.39 to 3.44 new infections when no members of the community are immune and no preventive measures are taken. The reproduction number may be higher in densely populated conditions such as those found on cruise ships. Human behavior affects the R0 value and hence estimates of R0 differ between different countries, cultures, and social norms. For instance, one study found relatively low R0 (~3.5) in Sweden, Belgium and the Netherlands, while Spain and the US had significantly higher R0 values (5.9 to 6.4, respectively).\nReproductive value R0 of SARS-CoV-2 variants\n\n\nVariant\n\nR0\n\nSource\n\n\nReference/ancestral strain\n\n~2.8\n\n\n\n\nAlpha (B.1.1.7)\n\n(40-90% higher than previous variants)\n\n\n\n\nDelta (B.1.617.2)\n\n~5 (3-8)\nThere have been about 96,000 confirmed cases of infection in mainland China. While the proportion of infections that result in confirmed cases or progress to diagnosable disease remains unclear, one mathematical model estimated that 75,815 people were infected on 25 January 2020 in Wuhan alone, at a time when the number of confirmed cases worldwide was only 2,015. Before 24 February 2020, over 95% of all deaths from COVID-19 worldwide had occurred in Hubei province, where Wuhan is located. As of 10 March 2023, the percentage had decreased to 0.047%.\nAs of 10 March 2023, there were 676,609,955 total confirmed cases of SARS\u2011CoV\u20112 infection. The total number of deaths attributed to the virus was 6,881,955.\n\n\nSee also\n3C-like protease (NS5)"

But if you\u2019re among the 78 million Americans with\nhypertension or are one of the 70 million with prehypertension (higher-than-\nhealthy blood pressure levels), it\u2019s important to understand its effects on\nyour health\u2014and to take action today to bring your numbers down to healthier\nlevels.\n\nBlood pressure is the force of blood against the inner walls of your arteries.\nIt has normal fluctuations throughout the day\u2014falling when you\u2019re relaxed or\nasleep, rising naturally in the morning, and increasing temporarily when\nyou\u2019re under stress, excited or exercising. But when your resting blood\npressure level rises too high, it can scar, stiffen and/or weaken blood\nvessels. This effect can double your risk for a [ heart attack\n](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/healthlibrary/conditions/adult/cardiovascular_diseases/heart_attack_85,P00702)\n; quadruple your odds for a [ stroke\n](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/healthlibrary/conditions/adult/cardiovascular_diseases/stroke_brain_attack_85,P00249)\n; raise your risk for heart failure , vision loss, kidney problems, [ dementia\n](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/healthy_aging/diseases_and_conditions/hypertension-\nwhat-you-need-to-know-as-you-age#definitions_block) and circulation problems\nsuch as [ peripheral artery disease\n](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/healthy_aging/diseases_and_conditions/hypertension-\nwhat-you-need-to-know-as-you-age#definitions_block) (which causes pain in your\nlegs); [ weaken your bones\n](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/healthy_aging/diseases_and_conditions/osteoporosis-\nwhat-you-need-to-know-as-you-age) ; and contribute to [ erectile dysfunction\n](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/healthlibrary/conditions/adult/kidney_and_urinary_system_disorders/impotence_erectile_dysfunction_85,P01482)\nin men.\n\n![older man speaking to nurse](/-/media/images/health/1_-conditions/high-\nblood-\npressure/hypertension640x300.jpg?h=244&iar=0&mh=360&mw=520&w=520&hash=5EA281C861FAD603E25CA699BB798E02)\n\n###  **Causes and Risk Factors**\n\nYou may be at an increased risk for high blood pressure if you smoke, are\noverweight, eat a diet that\u2019s low on produce and fiber and/or high in fat and\nsalt, drink alcohol to excess, live with chronic stress or don\u2019t get much\nphysical activity. Some causes of hypertension cannot be controlled\u2014including\nyour genes and your race (African-Americans are at a higher risk). Aging also\nplays a role. Even if you do not have hypertension by age 55 to 65, your\nlifetime risk for developing it is a whopping 90 percent.\n\n\u201cBut doctors no longer consider hypertension inevitable or untreatable with\nage,\u201d says [ Samuel Durso, M.D.\n](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/profiles/details/samuel-durso) , director of\nthe Division of Geriatric Medicine and Gerontology at Johns Hopkins.\n\nIn one Johns Hopkins study of 975 older women and men with hypertension,\nhealthy lifestyle steps helped 40 percent stop taking blood pressure\nmedications. Other research has shown that lifestyle changes can lower the\nrisk for hypertension in African-Americans and others at an increased genetic\nrisk.\n\n##  Prevention\n\nA healthy lifestyle is a strong shield against high blood pressure and its\ndamaging effects. These steps can lower your risk\u2014and also help lower your\nnumbers if you already have prehypertension or hypertension.\n\n**Lose a little weight.** Excess weight\u2014and especially excess fat stored in\nyour abdomen\u2014can raise blood pressure by increasing your blood volume and by\nchanging the balance of pressure-regulating hormones. \u201cEven modest weight loss\ncan make a world of difference,\u201d Durso notes, pointing to research that shows\nthat losing just 7.7 pounds could reduce your risk for high blood pressure by\n50 percent or more.\n\n**Cut back on alcohol.** \u201cModerating alcohol is very important,\u201d Durso says.\n\u201cIf you are a man who has more than two drinks a day or a woman who has more\nthan one drink a day, cut back.\u201d While a little alcohol may relax arteries,\ntoo much seems to have the opposite effect.\n\n**Move more.** Exercise and other kinds of physical activity help keep\narteries flexible and also reduce activity in the [ sympathetic nervous system\n](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/healthy_aging/diseases_and_conditions/hypertension-\nwhat-you-need-to-know-as-you-age#definitions_block) , which can tighten [\nblood vessels\n](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/healthy_aging/diseases_and_conditions/hypertension-\nwhat-you-need-to-know-as-you-age#definitions_block) and boost blood pressure.\nIf you already have high blood pressure, regular exercise alone could lower\nyour numbers by 8 to 10 points, according to the American Heart Association.\n\n**Feed healthy blood pressure.** The minerals calcium, magnesium and potassium\n(found in low-fat and fat-free dairy products, such as milk and yogurt, as\nwell as in produce and dried beans) help your body regulate blood pressure.\nToo little can raise your blood pressure. So can high amounts of sodium\u2014found\nin many processed foods\u2014by making your body retain water (which boosts blood\nvolume) and even tightening small blood vessels. [ Saturated fat\n](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/healthy_aging/diseases_and_conditions/hypertension-\nwhat-you-need-to-know-as-you-age#definitions_block) (found in meat, cheese,\nbutter, full-fat dairy products and many processed foods) may also raise blood\npressure.\n\n**Quit smoking.** Smoking damages arteries and raises the risk of heart\ndisease. While you\u2019re having a cigarette, the chemicals in tobacco products\nelevate blood pressure too.\n\n**Soothe stress.** It\u2019s not clear whether mind-body therapies have a lasting\neffect on blood pressure or reduce the risk, but it is known that the body\u2019s\nstress response releases hormones that temporarily raise blood pressure.\nYou\u2019ll feel better, and find it easier to make other healthy changes, if you\nregularly practice a stress-soothing technique such as breathing exercises,\nprogressive relaxation and fitness activities. One technique, meditation, has\nbeen shown to reduce the risk for heart attacks and strokes in people with\nhigh blood pressure.\n\n##  Diagnosis & Treatment\n\nTo bring your high blood pressure down to a healthy level, your doctor will\nlikely recommend healthy lifestyle changes, medication or both. \u201cThe decision\nto begin blood pressure medication\u2014and the amount and type your doctor\nprescribes\u2014will depend on the severity of your high blood pressure,\u201d Durso\nexplains. \u201cIf you have prehypertension or if your blood pressure is mildly\nelevated, lifestyle changes alone may be the first step. Losing 5 percent to\n10 percent of your body weight, reducing sodium, improving your diet and\nexercising regularly will usually result in a lowering of your blood pressure.\nIf your blood pressure is higher, your doctor will still recommend these\nchanges along with blood pressure medications.\u201d\n\nThere are six major types of blood pressure medications:\n\n* **Diuretics** work by helping the body eliminate extra water and sodium.\n* **Beta blockers** reduce your heart rate and output of blood, which lowers blood pressure.\n* **Vasodilators, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs)** and **calcium-channel blockers** all work by relaxing constricted blood vessels.\n\n\u201cYour doctor will choose the medications that are right for you,\u201d Durso says.\n\u201cOften, doctors prescribe more than one medication to control blood pressure.\nYou may need medications that work on several different mechanisms to bring\nyour blood pressure down. Or your doctor may be able to give you lower\nmedication doses, and reduce the chances for side effects, by combining two or\nthree medications.\u201d\n\nTwo important things to know about your treatment:\n\n**Your doctor may increase your dose gradually.** \u201cIt may take a month to six\nweeks to bring your blood pressure down by slowly raising your medication\ndoses,\u201d Durso notes. \u201cLowering blood pressure too quickly can cause dizziness\nand increase the risk for falls.\u201d\n\n**Report side effects.** \u201cDon\u2019t stop medications on your own,\u201d warns Durso.\n\u201cCall or make an appointment to tell your doctor about side effects you may be\nhaving. He or she may be able to make adjustments or switch your medication.\u201d\nSide effects can include tiredness, cold hands or feet, impotence, depression,\nsleep problems, heartbeat changes and a dry cough.\n\nLearn more about the [ symptoms, diagnosis and treatment of hypertension\n](http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/healthlibrary/conditions/adult/cardiovascular_diseases/high_blood_pressure_hypertension_85,P00224/)\nin the [ Health Library ](http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/healthlibrary/) .\n\n##  Living With\n\nHigh blood pressure often has no symptoms. That can make staying on track with\nhealthy lifestyle changes and medication challenging\u2014you may not feel the\ndifference. These steps can help you stay committed to controlling your blood\npressure on a day-to-day basis:\n\n**Use a medication reminder system.** A daily pill dispenser, electronic pill\nbottles that beep when it\u2019s time for your next dose, a note on your\nrefrigerator\u2014use whichever reminder system works best for you. About one in\ntwo people with hypertension don\u2019t take their drugs as directed, a mistake\nthat can raise your risk for heart disease, stroke and other health problems.\n\n**Monitor at home.** \u201cYou are the most important member of your blood pressure\ncontrol team. A home blood pressure monitor will help you see if your\nmedications and lifestyle changes are helping, and can help you stay on\ntrack,\u201d Durso says. \u201cYou can find inexpensive monitors at the pharmacy.\u201d\n\n**See your doctor as recommended.** \u201cYour doctor may want to see you every\nthree to four months for the first few years after your diagnosis, to be sure\nyour medications and lifestyle changes are working and to make adjustments,\u201d\nDurso says. \u201cFor someone whose high blood pressure is well-managed and who\nmonitors at home, a checkup every six months may be sufficient. If your blood\npressure is within a healthy range and you do not need medication, you may\nonly need a recheck every two years.\u201d\n\n**Watch for lows and highs.** Sometimes blood pressure medications can reduce\nyour blood pressure _too_ much. If you have signs of low blood\npressure\u2014dizziness, fainting, blurred vision, nausea\u2014contact your doctor. On\nthe other hand, if your [ systolic\n](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/healthy_aging/diseases_and_conditions/hypertension-\nwhat-you-need-to-know-as-you-age#definitions_block) (top) number rises to 180\nor higher or if your [ diastolic\n](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/healthy_aging/diseases_and_conditions/hypertension-\nwhat-you-need-to-know-as-you-age#definitions_block) (bottom) number rises to\n110 or higher, get immediate medical help.\n\n##  Research\n\nJohns Hopkins experts continue their work in understanding and treating high\nblood pressure in ways that translate into better health today. Notable\nresearch you can access includes these findings:\n\n**Link found between taking blood pressure medications and reduced risk of\ndementia.** In a 2013 study of 3,000 older people, published in the journal\n_Neurology, Johns Hopkins researchers found that those taking diuretics,_ ARBs\nand/or ACE inhibitors had a 50 percent lower risk for [ Alzheimer\u2019s disease\n](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/healthy_aging/diseases_and_conditions/alzheimers-\ndisease-what-you-need-to-know-as-you-age) .\n\n**Intensive treatment lowers blood pressure in African-American men.** Urban\nAfrican-American men face a high risk for untreated hypertension\u2014with fatal\nconsequences. In a 5-year-long study of 309 African-American men ages 21 to\n54, Johns Hopkins researchers found that medication, home health visits and\nclinic appointments lowered participants\u2019 blood pressure significantly.\n\n##  For Caregivers\n\nIf you are the partner or caregiver of someone with high blood pressure,\nhere\u2019s how you can help.\n\n**Ask how you can assist with medications.** You can provide \u201ctime for\nmedication\u201d reminders and help your loved one take prescribed drugs when\nneeded.\n\n**Support healthy efforts.** Cheerleading a new habit can inspire your loved\none to stick with it. But trying to control behavior can backfire. If your\nloved one isn\u2019t making healthy changes, ask how you can help.\n\n**Get healthier together.** Spouses who commit to weight loss and exercise\ntogether may be more likely to stick with their efforts. Upgrading your habits\ntogether can be inspiring, engenders a little healthy competition, and is more\nconvenient too, because you can both eat the same foods and set the same\nexercise schedule.\n\n###  Definitions\n\n**Blood vessels (veh-suls):** The system of flexible tubes\u2014arteries,\ncapillaries and veins\u2014that carries blood through the body. Oxygen and\nnutrients are delivered by arteries to tiny, thin-walled capillaries that feed\nthem to cells and pick up waste material, including carbon dioxide.\nCapillaries pass the waste to veins, which take the blood back to the heart\nand lungs, where carbon dioxide is let out through your breath as you exhale.\n\n**Dementia (di-men-sha):** A loss of brain function that can be caused by a\nvariety of disorders affecting the brain. Symptoms include forgetfulness,\nimpaired thinking and judgment, personality changes, agitation and loss of\nemotional control. Alzheimer\u2019s disease, Huntington\u2019s disease and inadequate\nblood flow to the brain can all cause dementia. Most types of dementia are\nirreversible.\n\n**Diastolic (die-uh-stah-lick) blood pressure:** The second, or bottom, number\nin a blood pressure reading. Diastolic blood pressure measures the force of\nblood in the arteries when the heart is relaxed between beats. A healthy\nreading is usually below 80 mm Hg. Higher readings may indicate that you have\nhigh blood pressure or are at risk for developing it.\n\n**Heart failure:** When the heart cannot supply as much blood as the body\nneeds, because it cannot fill completely or cannot pump with enough force.\nDiabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease and heart valve problems can\ncause heart failure. Heart failure does not mean the heart is about to stop.\nMedications and lifestyle changes can reduce symptoms.\n\n**Peripheral artery disease (puh-rif-er-uhl ahr-tah-ree dih-zeez):** A build-\nup of fat and cholesterol deposits called plaque in arteries in your legs,\narms, head or internal organs. This reduces blood flow, causing pain, numbness\nand a heavy, aching sensation when walking or climbing stairs. Peripheral\nartery disease can increase the risk for slow-healing infections, too.\nTreatments include quitting smoking and controlling blood pressure,\ncholesterol and blood sugar.\n\n**Saturated fat:** A type of fat found in abundance in butter, whole milk, ice\ncream, full-fat cheese, fatty meats, poultry skin, and palm and coconut oils.\nSaturated fat raises levels of heart-threatening LDL cholesterol in your\nbloodstream. It can also interfere with your body\u2019s ability to absorb blood\nsugar easily. Limiting saturated fat can help control your risk for heart\ndisease.\n\n**Sympathetic nervous system:** The system that produces the \u201cfight or flight\u201d\nresponse and prepares you for stress or an emergency. It\u2019s responsible for\nreadying the body for action: increasing the heart rate, breathing rate and\nalertness. The body\u2019s parasympathetic nervous system does the opposite. It\nslows heart and breathing rate, bringing on a sense of relaxation.\n\n**Systolic (sis-tall-ick) blood pressure:** The top, or first, number in a\nblood pressure reading. Systolic blood pressure is the pressure in the\narteries during a heartbeat. For most people, a healthy systolic blood\npressure reading is below 120 mm Hg. Rising systolic blood pressure may\nindicate that arteries are becoming stiff or that there\u2019s a build-up of\nplaque.\n\n##  Stay on Top of Your Heart Health\n\n![doctor listening to patient's chest - stay on top of your heart\nhealth](/-/media/images/health/3_-wellness/heart-health/stay-on-top-of-your-\nheart-health-content-\nimage.jpg?h=299&iar=0&mh=300&mw=500&w=500&hash=95C574D7B82D778F97BD008A77BFC9D4)\n\nIf you have a new or existing heart problem, it's vital to see a doctor.

    "content": "\nCoconut milk is an opaque, milky-white liquid extracted from the grated pulp of mature coconuts. The opacity and rich taste of coconut milk are due to its high oil content, most of which is saturated fat. Coconut milk is a traditional food ingredient used in Southeast Asia, Oceania, South Asia, and East Africa. It is also used for cooking in the Caribbean, tropical Latin America, and West Africa, where coconuts were introduced during the colonial era.\nCoconut milk is differentiated into subtypes based on fat content. They can be generalized into coconut cream (or thick coconut milk) with the highest amount of fat; coconut milk (or thin coconut milk) with a maximum of around 20% fat; and coconut skim milk with negligible amounts of fat. This terminology is not always followed in commercial coconut milk sold in Western countries.\nCoconut milk can also be used to produce milk substitutes (differentiated as \"coconut milk beverages\"). These products are not the same as regular coconut milk products which are meant for cooking, not drinking. A sweetened, processed, coconut milk product from Puerto Rico is also known as cream of coconut. It is used in many desserts and beverages like the pi\u00f1a colada, though it should not be confused with coconut cream.\n\nNutrition[edit]\n\n\nCoconut milk, raw (liquid expressed from grated pulp and water)Nutritional value per 100 gEnergy962\u00a0kJ (230\u00a0kcal)Carbohydrates5.5 gSugars3.3 gDietary fibre2.2 g\nFat23.8 gSaturated21.1 gMonounsaturated1.0 gPolyunsaturated0.26 g\nProtein2.3 g\nVitaminsQuantity %DVVitamin A equiv.beta-Carotene0% 0 \u03bcg0%0 \u03bcgThiamine (B1)3% 0.03 mgRiboflavin (B2)0% 0 mgNiacin (B3)0.76 mgPantothenic acid (B5)4% 0.18 mgVitamin B62% 0.03 mgFolate (B9)4% 16 \u03bcgVitamin C3% 2.8 mgVitamin E1% 0.15 mgVitamin K0% 0.1 \u03bcg\nMineralsQuantity %DVCalcium2% 16 mgIron12% 1.6 mgMagnesium10% 37 mgManganese44% 0.92 mgPhosphorus14% 100 mgPotassium9% 263 mgSodium1% 15 mgZinc7% 0.67 mg\nOther constituentsQuantityWater67.6 g\nFull Report from the USDA Nutrient Database\nUnits\n\u03bcg = micrograms\u00a0\u2022 mg = milligrams\nIU = International units\nPercentages are roughly approximated using US\u00a0recommendations for adults.\nIn a 100 milliliter (ml) portion, coconut milk contains 230 kilocalories and is 68% water, 24% total fat, 6% carbohydrates, and 2% protein (see table). The fat composition includes 21 grams of saturated fat, half of which is lauric acid.\nCoconut milk is a rich source (20% or more of the Daily Value, DV) of manganese (44% DV per 100 g) and an adequate source (10\u201319% DV per 100 g) of phosphorus, iron, and magnesium, with no other nutrients in significant content (see table).\n\nDefinition and terminology[edit]\nCoconut milk is a relatively stable oil-in-water emulsion with proteins that act as emulsifiers and thickening agents. It is opaque and milky white in color and ranges in consistency from watery to creamy. Based on fat content, coconut milk is divided into different subtypes generally simplified into \"coconut cream\", \"coconut milk\", and \"coconut skim milk\", from highest to lowest respectively. Coconut milk and coconut cream (also called \"thin coconut milk\" and \"thick coconut milk\", respectively) are traditionally differentiated in countries where coconuts are native based on the stages of extraction. They are also differentiated in modern standards set by the Asian and Pacific Coconut Community (APCC) and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). However, the terminologies are not always followed in commercial coconut milk (especially in western countries) because these standards are not mandatory. This can cause confusion among consumers.\nThe Asian and Pacific Coconut Community standardizes coconut milk and coconut cream products as:\nRange of fat by weight in coconut cream and milk (APCC Standards)\n\n\nProduct\n\nFat content(%m/m)\n\n\nConcentrated coconut cream\n\n40\u201350\n\n\nHigh fat coconut cream\n\n30\u201339\n\n\nMedium fat coconut cream\n\n25\u201329\n\n\nLow fat coconut cream\n\n20\u201325\n\n\nHigh fat coconut milk\n\n15\u201320\n\n\nMedium fat coconut milk\n\n10\u201315\n\n\nLow fat coconut milk\n\n5\u201310\n\n\nCoconut skim milk\n\n0\u20131.5\nThe Codex Alimentarius of the FAO standardizes coconut milk and coconut cream products as:\nClassification of coconut milk and cream(CODEX STAN 240-2003, Codex Alimentarius, FAO)\n\n\nProduct\n\nTotal solids(%m/m)Min.-Max.\n\nNon-fat solids(%m/m)Min.\n\nFat(%m/m)Min.\n\nMoisture(%m/m)Max.\n\npH\n\n\nLight coconut milk\n\n6.6 - 12.6\n\n1.6\n\n5\n\n93.4\n\n5.9\n\n\nCoconut milk\n\n12.7 - 25.3\n\n2.7\n\n10\n\n87.3\n\n5.9\n\n\nCoconut cream\n\n25.4 - 37.3\n\n5.4\n\n20\n\n74.6\n\n5.9\n\n\nCoconut cream concentrate\n\n37.4 min.\n\n8.4\n\n29\n\n62.6\n\n5.9\nCoconut milk can also sometimes be confused with coconut water. Coconut water is the clear fluid found within the coconut seed, while coconut milk is the extracted liquid derived from the manual or mechanical crushing of the white inner flesh of mature coconuts. Coconut cream should also not be confused with creamed coconut, which is a semi-solid paste made from finely ground coconut pulp, and cream of coconut, which is a processed product made from heavily sweetened coconut cream.\n\nTraditional preparation[edit]\nCoconut being grated\nCoconut milk is traditionally made by grating the white inner flesh of mature coconuts and mixing the shredded coconut pulp with a small amount of hot water in order to suspend the fat present in the grated pulp. The grating process can be carried out manually or by machine.\nGrated coconut being pressed through cheesecloth\nThick coconut cream derived from the first pressings of the grated coconut\nCoconut milk preparation\nCoconut milk is also traditionally divided into two grades: coconut cream (or thick coconut milk) and thin coconut milk. Coconut cream contains around 20% to 50% fat; while thin coconut milk contains 5% to 20% fat.\nCoconut cream is extracted from the first pressings of grated coconut pulp directly through cheesecloth. Sometimes a small amount of hot water may also be added, but generally coconut cream is extracted with no added water. Thin coconut milk, on the other hand, is produced by the subsequent pressings after soaking the squeezed coconut pulp with hot water.\nGravity separation can also be used to derive a top layer of coconut cream and a bottom layer of coconut skim milk. This is achieved by simply allowing the extracted liquid to stand for an hour. Conversely, coconut cream can be diluted into thinner coconut milk by simply adding water.\nTraditionally prepared coconut milk is utilized immediately after being freshly extracted because it spoils easily when exposed to air. It becomes rancid after a few hours at room temperatures 28 to 30\u00a0\u00b0C (82 to 86\u00a0\u00b0F) due to lipid oxidation and lipolysis. Rancid coconut milk gives off a strong unpleasant smell and has a distinctive soapy taste.\nCoconut cream contains a higher amount of soluble, suspended solids, which makes it a good ingredient for desserts, and rich and dry sauces. Because thin milk contains a lesser amount of these soluble solids, it is mainly used in general cooking. The distinction between coconut cream and thin coconut milk is not usually made in western nations due to the fact that fresh coconut milk is uncommon in these countries and most consumers buy coconut milk in cartons or cans.\nCoconut milk is also an intermediate step in the traditional wet process methods of producing virgin coconut oil by gradual heating, churning, or fermentation. These methods, however, are less efficient than coconut oil production from copra.\nCoconut graters[edit]\nTraditional coconut grater\nCoconut graters (also called \"coconut scrapers\"), a necessary tool for traditionally extracting coconut milk, were part of the material culture of the Austronesian peoples. From Island Southeast Asia, it was carried along with the sea voyages of the Austronesian expansion both for colonization and trade, reaching as far as Polynesia in the east, and Madagascar and the Comoros in the west in prehistoric times. The technology also spread to non-Austronesian cultures in coastal East Africa by proximity. Manual coconut graters remain a standard kitchen equipment in households in the tropical Asia-Pacific and Eastern Africa, underscoring the importance of coconut milk and coconut oil extraction in the Indo-Pacific.\nThe basic design of coconut graters consists of a low bench or stool with a horizontal serrated disk (made of metal in Asia and Africa, and stone or shell in Oceania) attached on one end. A person sits on the bench and repeatedly scrapes the inner surface of halved coconut shells with both hands over the metal disk. The scrapings are gathered by a container placed below.\nMore modern mechanical coconut graters dating back to the mid-1800s consist of serrated blades with a hand crank. This version is believed to be a British invention.\n\nProcessed coconut milk products[edit]\nMechanical coconut grinder\nCanned commercially-processed coconut milk\nCommercially processed coconut milk products use largely the same processes to extract coconut milk from pulp, though they use more mechanical equipment like deshelling machines, grinders and pulverizers, motorized coconut shredders, and coconut milk extractors.\nThey differ significantly in the bottling or canning process, however. Processed coconut milk products are first filtered through a 100 mesh filters. They are pasteurized indirectly by double boiling at around 70\u00a0\u00b0C (158\u00a0\u00b0F), carefully not exceeding 80\u00a0\u00b0C (176\u00a0\u00b0F), the temperature at which coconut milk starts to coagulate. After pasteurization, they are immediately transferred to filling vessels and sealed before being cooled down. They are then packed into bottles, cans, or pouches and blast frozen for storage and transport.\nManufacturers of canned coconut milk typically combine diluted and comminuted milk with the addition of water as a filler. Depending on the brand and age of the milk itself, a thicker, more paste-like consistency floats to the top of the can (a gravity separation, similar to traditional methods), and is sometimes separated and used in recipes that require coconut cream rather than coconut milk. Some brands sold in Western countries undergo homogenization and contain additional thickening agents and emulsifiers to prevent the milk from separating inside the can.\nDue to factors like pasteurization and minimal contact with oxygen, processed coconut milk generally has a longer shelf life than traditionally prepared coconut milk. It is also more efficient than traditional methods at extracting the maximum amount of coconut milk from grated coconut.\nCoconut milk powder[edit]\n\nMain article: Coconut milk powder\nCoconut cream can be dehydrated into coconut milk powder which has a far longer shelf life. They are processed by adding maltodextrin and casein to coconut cream to improve fluidity and then spray drying the mixture. The powder is packaged in moisture-proof containers. To use, water is simply added to the coconut milk powder.\nCoconut skim milk[edit]\nCoconut skim milk is coconut milk with very low levels of fat (0% to 1.5%). It is a byproduct of coconut cream and coconut oil production and is usually discarded. However, it is increasingly being used as a food ingredient for products which require coconut flavoring without the fats (including coconut powder, coconut honey, and coconut jam). It can also be used as a base in the production of coconut milk beverages used as milk substitutes, as it does not contain the high levels of fat characteristic of regular coconut milk while still being a good source of soluble proteins.\nMilk substitutes[edit]\nA carton of coconut milk beverage, a milk substitute\nProcessed coconut milk can be used as a substitute for milk beverages, usually marketed as \"coconut milk beverage\". They are sometimes confusingly also simply labeled as \"coconut milk\", though they are not the same product as coconut milk used for cooking (which is not meant for drinking). Milk substitutes from coconut are basically coconut milk diluted with water or coconut skim milk with additives. They contain less fat and fewer calories than milk, but also less protein. They contain high amounts of potassium and are good sources of fiber and iron. They are also commonly fortified with vitamin D and calcium.\nFilled milk[edit]\n\nMain article: Filled milk\nCoconut milk is also used widely for filled milk products. It is blended with milk (usually skim milk or powdered milk) for its vegetable oils and proteins which act as substitutes for expensive butterfat in some processed milk products. They include low fat filled milk, evaporated reconstituted milk, and sweetened condensed milk.\nCheese and custard production[edit]\nCoconut milk can also be used in cheese and custard production, substituting at most 50% of milk without lowering the overall quality of the products. By mixing skim milk with coconut milk, one procedure develops cheeses \u2013 including a garlic-spiced soft cheese called queso de ajo, a Gouda cheese substitute, and a Roquefort substitute called \"Niyoblue\" (a portmanteau of Tagalog: niyog, \"coconut\", and \"blue\").\nSoy milk enrichment[edit]\nCoconut milk can be used to enrich the fat content of soy milk, improving its texture and taste to be closer to that of real milk. Coconut cream can also be added to soy milk in the production of tofu to enrich its caloric density without affecting its palatability.\nCream of coconut[edit]\nCream of coconut is a thick, heavily sweetened, processed coconut milk product resembling condensed milk. It is originally produced by the Puerto Rican company Coco L\u00f3pez and is used most notably in pi\u00f1a coladas in the United States. It can also be used for other cocktail drinks and various desserts. It should not be confused with or used as a substitute for coconut cream.\n\nCuisine[edit]\nCoconut milk derivatives[edit]\nCoconut curd latik, a byproduct of traditional coconut oil production from simmered coconut milk\nIn the Philippines, coconut milk can also be further processed into coconut caramel and coconut curds, both known as lat\u00edk. The coconut caramel lat\u00edk made from a reduction of muscovado sugar and coconut milk has been developed into a commercial product marketed as coconut syrup (not to be confused with coconut sugar derived from coconut sap).\nKaya coconut jam, made with coconut milk, sugar, and eggs\nA similar product found throughout Southeast Asia is coconut jam. It is known as matam\u00eds sa b\u00e1o in the Philippines and uses only coconut milk and sugar. However, the coconut jam versions from Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore (kaya); Thailand (sangkhaya); Cambodia (sankiah); and Vietnam (banh gan), add eggs in addition to sugar. The latter versions are sometimes anglicized as \"coconut custard\" to distinguish them from the version without egg. Coconut jam and coconut custard have a thicker, jam-like consistency and are used as ingredients or fillings in various traditional desserts.\nFood[edit]\n\nSee also: List of dishes using coconut milk\nCoconut milk can be used in both sweet and savory dishes. In many tropical and Asian cuisines, it is a traditional ingredient in curries and other dishes, including desserts.\nSoutheast Asia[edit]\nIn Indonesia, coconut milk is used in various recipes ranging from savoury dishes\u00a0\u2013 such as rendang, soto, gulai, mie celor, sayur lodeh, gudeg, sambal goreng krechek, and opor ayam\u00a0\u2013 to sweet desserts, such as serabi, es cendol and es doger. Soto is ubiquitous in Indonesia and considered one of Indonesia's national dishes. It is also used in coconut rice, a widespread Southeast Asian dish of rice cooked in coconut milk, including the nasi lemak of Malaysia and the nasi uduk of Indonesia.\nIn Malaysia, coconut milk is one of the essential ingredients in a lot of the dishes, this includes a few of the popular dishes in the region, such as the ubiquitous nasi lemak and nasi dagang, rendang, laksa, gulai and Tamil and Mamak style-curry, it is also used in dessert-making such as Kuih Lapis, kaya and dodol.\nIn the Philippines, diverse dishes cooked in coconut milk are called ginata\u00e1n. They can range from savoury dishes to desserts. Coconut milk is widely used to make traditional Filipino kakan\u00edn (the generic term for rice pastries), including bibingka and biko, among others.\nAdobong Man\u00f3k sa Gat\u00e2, a variant of chicken adobo with coconut milk\nIn Thailand, coconut milk is used in dishes such as tom kha kai, khao tom mat, mango sticky rice, and tom yum.\nLatin America and the Caribbean[edit]\nIn Brazil, coconut milk is mostly used in northeastern cuisine, generally with seafood stews and desserts. In Venezuela, pulp dishes are prepared with coconut milk and shredded fish in a dish called mojito en coco. In Colombia and Panama, the grated flesh of coconut and coconut milk are used to make sweet titot\u00e9, a key ingredient in making arroz com coco (coconut rice).\nCoconut milk is used to make traditional Venezuelan dishes, such as majarete (a typical Venezuelan dessert), and arroz con coco (the Venezuelan version of coconut rice).\nDrink[edit]\nCendol, a green jelly drink in iced coconut milk and palm sugar\nIn Southeast Asia, coconut milk is used to make many traditional drinks. Cendol is a popular iced drink from this region containing chilled coconut milk and green jellies made of rice flour. Coconut milk is also used in hot drinks such as bandrek and bajigur, two popular drinks from Indonesia. Sweetened coconut milk, and coconut milk diluted with water are two popular coconut beverages in southern China and Taiwan.\nThe jelly-like pulp from the inside of the coconut is often added to coconut water to make a tropical drink. In Brazil, for example, coconut milk is mixed with sugar and cacha\u00e7a to make a cocktail called batida de c\u00f4co. Puerto Rico is also popular for tropical drinks containing coconut, such as pi\u00f1a colada and coquito, which typically contain coconut milk or coconut cream.\n\nSaturated fat and health risk[edit]\nOne of the most prominent components of coconut milk is coconut oil, which many health organizations discourage people from consuming in significant amounts due to its high levels of saturated fat. Excessive coconut milk consumption can also raise blood levels of cholesterol due to the amount of lauric acid, a saturated fat that contributes to higher blood cholesterol.\n\nHorticulture[edit]\nIn 1943, it was discovered that coconut milk could actively encourage plant growth. Although there are many factors that attribute coconut milk to plant growth, the main cause is the existence of a cytokinin known as zeatin found in coconut milk. While the zeatin in coconut milk speeds up plant growth in general, it does not speed up growth in certain plants such as radishes. However, when 10% coconut milk is added to the substrate on which wheat is grown, substantial improvements have been noted.\n\nCommerce[edit]\nCoconuts are widely produced in tropical climates and exported globally as canned products, most frequently to North America and Europe.\n\nSee also[edit]\nCreamed coconut\nGinataan\nList of dishes using coconut milk\nPlant milk\n\nNotes[edit]\n^ The United States Food and Drug Administration, World Health Organization, International College of Nutrition, the United States Department of Health and Human Services, American Dietetic Association, American Heart Association, British National Health Service, and Dietitians of Canada"

Although there are some health benefits associated with each of these regimes, there are also some risks. Here\u2019s what you need to know.\n\nHot workouts\nThe ideal body temperature is around 37\u2070C. When you exercise, your muscles are very inefficient and only 25% of the energy is used for movement. The other 75% of the energy muscles produce is lost as heat, increasing the temperature of your body. If it exceeds 40\u2070C, it can be dangereous, so your body tries to keep the temperature at around 37\u2070C.\n\nOne strategy to prevent body temperature from rising is getting more blood to the skin, which is people\u2019s faces flush during an intense workout. If you exercise in an already hot environment, the difference between body temperature and room temperature is small, and your heart needs to work harder trying to get more blood to the skin.\n\nAnother way your body gets rid of excess heat is by warming up sweat to the point at which it evaporates, which then takes heat with it when it evaporates to the air. You can lose up to two litres of water every hour through sweat. As you sweat more during exercise in the heat, it is important to replace the fluid you have lost or your blood can become thicker, which also puts a strain on the heart.\n\nBoth ways of keeping the body under 40\u2070C add an extra burden on the heart. As a result, cardio workouts are more difficult in hot environments and endurance performance is decreased in hot environments.\n\nBut exercising in a hot environment might be good for short activities that need powerful muscle contractions. There is also a school of thought that light-intensity workouts, such as yoga, can benefit because the extra strain on the heart during exercise in the heat can increase the number of calories you burn. But research by Central Michigan University showed that there was no difference in exercise intensity, so the amount of calories burnt doing yoga at 20\u2070C and 35\u2070C were the same.\n\nIncreasing muscle temperature can increase flexibility and reduce the risk of injury. But a hot environment does not necessarily mean increased muscle temperature.\n\nRegularly undertaking workouts in a hot environment can help endurance performance in the heat, but your overall fitness and health may not get anything extra.\n\n\nWorking out in the heat can improve endurance in the heat, but that\u2019s about all. Klemen K. Misic/Shutterstock\nCold workouts\nIn the cold, your body is hotter than the surrounding environment and can easily get rid of the heat produced in the muscles during exercise. This stops the temperature of the body from increasing during prolonged exercise and performance in your cardio session will usually be better on cold days. Researchers from the University of Aberdeen found endurance to be best at around 10\u2070C (compared with 4\u2070C, 21\u2070C and 31\u2070C).\n\nWhen it is really cold, the heat produced by your muscles is not enough to maintain a core temperature at 37\u2070C. The body has ways to cope with extreme cold environments, such as shivering. Shivering is essentially muscles contracting to produce heat, not movement. As with any muscle contraction, shivering requires energy and burns calories, so at rest you may burn more calories in the cold than in normal temperatures.\n\nAnother strategy to cope with cold is to use fat to produce heat. Researchers in the US have shown repeated workouts in the cold increases the amount of brown fat in your body. Brown fat is known as \u201cgood fat\u201d as it burns calories.\n\nBoth shivering and burning fat consume calories, and studios that hold workout classes at 7\u2070C have begun to appear, with the idea that they can help people lose weight. Researchers from Spain found that exposure to a progressively cold environment can increase energy expenditure by up to 30%, which corresponds to around 500 calories for 24 hours of cold exposure. This means exposure to cold can help you lose weight faster, but the effect would be small for a one-hour workout in the cold. And feeling cold is unpleasant.\n\nIf you want to increase your muscle strength, doing workouts in the cold probably won\u2019t help. Muscles work best at hot temperatures. When muscles get cold, the force they can produce decreases. You are also more likely to get injured in the cold, but the extra risk of injury is reduced if you warm up properly.\n\nTake-home message\nThe small extra amount of calories burnt in extreme environments (hot or cold) may help you lose weight, but it could be outweighed by the increased health risks and reduced performance. Doing 150 minutes of physical activity a week is the key to good health, regardless of the temperature.\n\nExercise\nFitness\nCold workout\nWant to write?\nWrite an article and join a growing community of more than 182,600 academics and researchers from 4,946 institutions.\n\nRegister now\nEditorial Policies\nCommunity standards\nRepublishing guidelines\nFriends of The Conversation\nAnalytics\nOur feeds\nDonate\nGet newsletter\nWho we are\nOur charter\nOur team\nPartners and funders\nResource for media\nContact us\nEn Espa\u00f1ol\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\nPrivacy policy\nTerms and conditions\nCorrections\nCopyright \u00a9 2010\u20132024, The Conversation US, Inc."

In  this interview  , Tam Nguyen, a professor of computer\nscience at the University of Dayton, explains how neural networks, programs in\nwhich a series of algorithms try to simulate the human brain work.\n\n##  What are some examples of neural networks that are familiar to most\npeople?\n\nThere are many applications of neural networks. One common example is your\nsmartphone  camera\u2019s ability to recognize faces.\n\nDriverless cars are equipped with multiple cameras which try to recognize\nother vehicles, traffic signs and pedestrians by using neural networks, and\nturn or adjust their speed accordingly.\n\nNeural networks try to simulate the brain by processing data through layers of\nartificial neurons.  MF3d / E+ via Getty Images\n\nNeural networks are also behind the text suggestions you see while writing\ntexts or emails, and even in the  translations  tools available online.\n\n##  Does the network need to have prior knowledge of something to be able to\nclassify or recognize it?\n\nYes, that\u2019s why there is a need to use big data in training neural networks.\nThey work because they are trained on vast amounts of data to then recognize,\nclassify and predict things.\n\nIn the driverless cars example, it would need to look at millions of images\nand video of all the things on the street and be told what each of those\nthings is. When you click on the images of crosswalks to prove that you\u2019re not\na robot while browsing the internet, it can also be used to help  train a\nneural network  . Only after seeing millions of crosswalks, from all different\nangles and lighting conditions, would a self-driving car be able to recognize\nthem when it\u2019s driving around in real life.\n\nMore complicated neural networks are actually able to teach themselves. In the\nvideo linked below, the network is given the task of going from point A to\npoint B, and you can see it trying all sorts of things to try to get the model\nto the end of the course, until it finds one that does the best job.\n\nSome neural networks can work together to create something new. In  this\nexample  , the networks create virtual faces that don\u2019t belong to real people\nwhen you refresh the screen. One network makes an attempt at creating a face,\nand the other tries to judge whether it is real or fake. They go back and\nforth until the second one cannot tell that the face created by the first is\nfake.\n\nHumans take advantage of big data too. A person perceives around 30 frames or\nimages per second, which means 1,800 images per minute, and over 600 million\nimages per year. That is why we should give neural networks a similar\nopportunity to have the big data for training.\n\n##  How does a basic neural network work?\n\nA neural network is a network of artificial neurons programmed in software. It\ntries to simulate the human brain, so it has many layers of \u201cneurons\u201d just\nlike the neurons in our brain. The first layer of neurons will receive inputs\nlike images, video, sound, text, etc. This input data goes through all the\nlayers, as the output of one layer is fed into the next layer.\n\nLet\u2019s take an example of a neural network that is trained to recognize dogs\nand cats. The first layer of neurons will break up this image into areas of\nlight and dark. This data will be fed into the next layer to recognize edges.\nThe next layer would then try to recognize the shapes formed by the\ncombination of edges. The data would go through several layers in a similar\nfashion to finally recognize whether the image you showed it is a dog or a cat\naccording to the data it\u2019s been trained on.\n\nThese networks can be incredibly complex and consist of millions of parameters\nto classify and recognize the input it receives.\n\n##  Why are we seeing so many applications of neural networks now?\n\nActually neural networks were invented a long time ago, in 1943, when Warren\nMcCulloch and Walter Pitts created a computational model for neural networks\nbased on algorithms. Then the idea went through a long hibernation because the\nimmense computational resources needed to build neural networks did not exist\nyet.\n\nRecently, the idea has come back in a big way, thanks to advanced\ncomputational resources like graphical processing units (GPUs). They are chips\nthat have been used for processing graphics in video games, but it turns out\nthat they are excellent for crunching the data required to run neural networks\ntoo. That is why we now see the proliferation of neural networks.\n\nTam Nguyen  is an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science at\nthe  University of Dayton.\n\nThis article is republished from  The Conversation  under a Creative Commons\nlicense.

    "content": "Gynoecium (/\u0261a\u026a\u02c8ni\u02d0si.\u0259m, d\u0292\u026a\u02c8ni\u02d0\u0283i.\u0259m/; from Ancient Greek  \u03b3\u03c5\u03bd\u03ae (gun\u1e17)\u00a0'woman, female', and  \u03bf\u1f36\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2 (o\u00eekos)\u00a0'house'; pl.: gynoecia) is most commonly used as a collective term for the parts of a flower that produce ovules and ultimately develop into the fruit and seeds. The gynoecium is the innermost whorl of a flower; it consists of (one or more) pistils and is typically surrounded by the pollen-producing reproductive organs, the stamens, collectively called the androecium. The gynoecium is often referred to as the \"female\" portion of the flower, although rather than directly producing female gametes (i.e. egg cells), the gynoecium produces megaspores, each of which develops into a female gametophyte which then produces egg cells.\nThe term gynoecium is also used by botanists to refer to a cluster of archegonia and any associated modified leaves or stems present on a gametophyte shoot in mosses, liverworts, and hornworts. The corresponding terms for the male parts of those plants are clusters of antheridia within the androecium. Flowers that bear a gynoecium but no stamens are called pistillate or carpellate. Flowers lacking a gynoecium are called staminate.\nThe gynoecium is often referred to as female because it gives rise to female (egg-producing) gametophytes; however, strictly speaking sporophytes do not have a sex, only gametophytes do. Gynoecium development and arrangement is important in systematic research and identification of angiosperms, but can be the most challenging of the floral parts to interpret.\n\nIntroduction[edit]\nUnlike (most) animals, plants grow new organs after embryogenesis, including new roots, leaves, and flowers. In the flowering plants, the gynoecium develops in the central region of the flower as a carpel or in groups of fused carpels.  After fertilization, the gynoecium develops into a fruit that provides protection and nutrition for the developing seeds, and often aids in their dispersal. The gynoecium has several specialized tissues. The tissues of the gynoecium develop from genetic and hormonal interactions along three-major axes. These tissue arise from meristems that produce cells that differentiate into the different tissues that produce the parts of the gynoecium including the pistil, carpels, ovary, and ovals; the carpel margin meristem (arising from the carpel primordium) produces the ovules, ovary septum, and the transmitting track, and plays a role in fusing the apical margins of carpels.\n\n\nPistil[edit]\n\"Pistil\" redirects here. Not to be confused with Pistol.\nA syncarpous gynoecium in context. The gynoecium (whether composed of a single carpel or multiple \"fused\" carpels) is typically made up of an ovary, style, and stigma as in the center of the flower.\nThe gynoecium may consist of one or more separate pistils. A pistil typically consists of an expanded basal portion called an ovary, an elongated section called a style and an apical structure called a stigma that receives pollen\nThe ovary (from Latin ovum, meaning egg) is the enlarged basal portion which contains placentas, ridges of tissue bearing one or more ovules (integumented megasporangia). The placentas and/or ovule(s) may be born on the gynoecial appendages or less frequently on the floral apex. The chamber in which the ovules develop is called a locule (or sometimes cell).\nThe style (from Ancient Greek \u03c3\u03c4\u1fe6\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2, stylos, meaning a pillar) is a pillar-like stalk through which pollen tubes grow to reach the ovary. Some flowers, such as those of Tulipa, do not have a distinct style, and the stigma sits directly on the ovary. The style is a hollow tube in some plants, such as lilies, or has transmitting tissue through which the pollen tubes grow.\nThe stigma (from Ancient Greek \u03c3\u03c4\u03af\u03b3\u03bc\u03b1, stigma, meaning mark or puncture) is usually found at the tip of the style, the portion of the carpel(s) that receives pollen (male gametophytes). It is commonly sticky or feathery to capture pollen.\nThe word \"pistil\" comes from Latin pistillum meaning pestle. A sterile pistil in a male flower is referred to as a pistillode.\n\nCarpels[edit]\nThe pistils of a flower are considered to be composed of one or more carpels. A carpel is the female reproductive part of the flower\u2014usually composed of the style, and stigma (sometimes having its individual ovary, and sometimes connecting to a shared basal ovary) \u2014and usually interpreted as modified leaves that bear structures called ovules, inside which egg cells ultimately form. A pistil may consist of one carpel (with its ovary, style and stigma); or it may comprise several carpels joined together to form a single ovary, the whole unit called a pistil. The gynoecium may present as one or more uni-carpellate pistils or as one multi-carpellate pistil. (The number of carpels is denoted by terms such as tricarpellate (three carpels).)\nCarpels are thought to be phylogenetically derived from ovule-bearing leaves or leaf homologues (megasporophylls), which evolved to form a closed structure containing the ovules. This structure is typically rolled and fused along the margin.\nAlthough many flowers satisfy the above definition of a carpel, there are also flowers that do not have carpels because in these flowers the ovule(s), although enclosed, are borne directly on the floral apex. Therefore, the carpel has been redefined as an appendage that encloses ovule(s) and may or may not bear them. However, the most unobjectionable definition of the carpel is simply that of an appendage that encloses an ovule or ovules.\nCentre of a Ranunculus repens (creeping buttercup) showing multiple unfused carpels surrounded by longer stamens\nCross-section through the ovary of Narcissus showing multiple connate carpels (a compound pistil) fused along the placental line where the ovules form in each locule\nPistil of Begonia grandis\n\nTypes[edit]\nIf a gynoecium has a single carpel, it is called monocarpous. If a gynoecium has multiple, distinct (free, unfused) carpels, it is apocarpous. If a gynoecium has multiple carpels \"fused\" into a single structure, it is syncarpous. A syncarpous gynoecium can sometimes appear very much like a monocarpous gynoecium.\nComparison of gynoecium terminology using carpel and pistil\n\n\nGynoecium composition\n\nCarpelterminology\n\nPistil terminology\n\nExamples\n\n\nSingle carpel\n\nMonocarpous (unicarpellate) gynoecium\n\nA pistil (simple)\n\nAvocado (Persea sp.), most legumes (Fabaceae)\n\n\nMultiple\u00a0distinct\u00a0(\"unfused\")\u00a0carpels\n\nApocarpous (choricarpous) gynoecium\n\nPistils (simple)\n\nStrawberry (Fragaria sp.), Buttercup (Ranunculus sp.)\n\n\nMultiple\u00a0connate\u00a0(\"fused\")\u00a0carpels\n\nSyncarpous gynoecium\n\nA pistil (compound)\n\nTulip (Tulipa sp.), most flowers\nThe degree of connation (\"fusion\") in a syncarpous gynoecium can vary. The carpels may be \"fused\" only at their bases, but retain separate styles and stigmas. The carpels may be \"fused\" entirely, except for retaining separate stigmas. Sometimes (e.g., Apocynaceae) carpels are fused by their styles or stigmas but possess distinct ovaries. In a syncarpous gynoecium, the \"fused\" ovaries of the constituent carpels may be referred to collectively as a single compound ovary. It can be a challenge to determine how many carpels fused to form a syncarpous gynoecium. If the styles and stigmas are distinct, they can usually be counted to determine the number of carpels. Within the compound ovary, the carpels may have distinct locules divided by walls called septa. If a syncarpous gynoecium has a single style and stigma and a single locule in the ovary, it may be necessary to examine how the ovules are attached. Each carpel will usually have a distinct line of placentation where the ovules are attached.\nPistil development[edit]\nPistils begin as small primordia on a floral apical meristem, forming later than, and closer to the (floral) apex than sepal, petal and stamen primordia. Morphological and molecular studies of pistil ontogeny reveal that carpels are most likely homologous to leaves.\nA carpel has a similar function to a megasporophyll, but typically includes a stigma, and is fused, with ovules enclosed in the enlarged lower portion, the ovary.\nIn some basal angiosperm lineages, Degeneriaceae and Winteraceae, a carpel begins as a shallow cup where the ovules develop with laminar placentation, on the upper surface of the carpel. The carpel eventually forms a folded, leaf-like structure, not fully sealed at its margins. No style exists, but a broad stigmatic crest along the margin allows pollen tubes access along the surface and between hairs at the margins.\nTwo kinds of fusion have been distinguished: postgenital fusion that can be observed during the development of flowers, and congenital fusion that cannot be observed i.e., fusions that occurred during phylogeny. But it is very difficult to distinguish fusion and non-fusion processes in the evolution of flowering plants. Some processes that have been considered congenital (phylogenetic) fusions appear to be non-fusion processes such as, for example, the de novo formation of intercalary growth in a ring zone at or below the base of primordia. Therefore, \"it is now increasingly acknowledged that the term 'fusion,' as applied to phylogeny (as in 'congenital fusion') is ill-advised.\"\n\nGynoecium position[edit]\nBasal angiosperm groups tend to have carpels arranged spirally around a conical or dome-shaped receptacle. In later lineages, carpels tend to be in whorls.\nThe relationship of the other flower parts to the gynoecium can be an important systematic and taxonomic character. In some flowers, the stamens, petals, and sepals are often said to be \"fused\" into a \"floral tube\" or hypanthium. However, as Leins & Erbar (2010) pointed out, \"the classical view that the wall of the inferior ovary results from the \"congenital\" fusion of dorsal carpel flanks and the floral axis does not correspond to the ontogenetic processes that can actually be observed. All that can be seen is an intercalary growth in a broad circular zone that changes the shape of the floral axis (receptacle).\" And what happened during evolution is not a phylogenetic fusion but the formation of a unitary intercalary meristem. Evolutionary developmental biology investigates such developmental processes that arise or change during evolution.\nIf the hypanthium is absent, the flower is hypogynous, and the stamens, petals, and sepals are all attached to the receptacle below the gynoecium. Hypogynous flowers are often referred to as having a superior ovary. This is the typical arrangement in most flowers.\nIf the hypanthium is present up to the base of the style(s), the flower is epigynous. In an epigynous flower, the stamens, petals, and sepals are attached to the hypanthium at the top of the ovary or, occasionally, the hypanthium may extend beyond the top of the ovary. Epigynous flowers are often referred to as having an inferior ovary. Plant families with epigynous flowers include orchids, asters, and evening primroses.\nBetween these two extremes are perigynous flowers, in which a hypanthium is present, but is either free from the gynoecium (in which case it may appear to be a cup or tube surrounding the gynoecium) or connected partly to the gynoecium (with the stamens, petals, and sepals attached to the hypanthium part of the way up the ovary). Perigynous flowers are often referred to as having a half-inferior ovary (or, sometimes, partially inferior or half-superior). This arrangement is particularly frequent in the rose family and saxifrages.\nOccasionally, the gynoecium is born on a stalk, called the gynophore, as in Isomeris arborea.\nFlowers and fruit (capsules) of the ground orchid, Spathoglottis plicata, illustrating an inferior ovary.\n\n\n\nIllustration showing longitudinal sections through hypogynous (a), perigynous (b), and epigynous (c) flowers\n\nPlacentation[edit]\n\nMain article: Ovule\nWithin the ovary, each ovule is born by a placenta or arises as a continuation of the floral apex. The placentas often occur in distinct lines called lines of placentation. In monocarpous or apocarpous gynoecia, there is typically a single line of placentation in each ovary. In syncarpous gynoecia, the lines of placentation can be regularly spaced along the wall of the ovary (parietal placentation), or near the center of the ovary. In the latter case, separate terms are used depending on whether or not the ovary is divided into separate locules. If the ovary is divided, with the ovules born on a line of placentation at the inner angle of each locule, this is axile placentation. An ovary with free central placentation, on the other hand, consists of a single compartment without septae and the ovules are attached to a central column that arises directly from the floral apex (axis). In some cases a single ovule is attached to the bottom or top of the locule (basal or apical placentation, respectively).\n\nThe ovule[edit]\n\nMain article: Ovule\nLongitudinal section of carpellate flower of squash showing ovary, ovules, stigma, style, and petals\nIn flowering plants, the ovule (from Latin ovulum meaning small egg) is a complex structure born inside ovaries. The ovule initially consists of a stalked, integumented megasporangium (also called the nucellus). Typically, one cell in the megasporangium undergoes meiosis resulting in one to four megaspores. These develop into a megagametophyte (often called the embryo sac) within the ovule. The megagametophyte typically develops a small number of cells, including two special cells, an egg cell and a binucleate central cell, which are the gametes involved in double fertilization. The central cell, once fertilized by a sperm cell from the pollen becomes the first cell of the endosperm, and the egg cell once fertilized become the zygote that develops into the embryo. The gap in the integuments through which the pollen tube enters to deliver sperm to the egg is called the micropyle. The stalk attaching the ovule to the placenta is called the funiculus.\n\n\nRole of the stigma and style[edit]\n\nMain article: Stigma (botany)\nStigmas can vary from long and slender to globe-shaped to feathery. The stigma is the receptive tip of the carpel(s), which receives pollen at pollination and on which the pollen grain germinates. The stigma is adapted to catch and trap pollen, either by combining pollen of visiting insects or by various hairs, flaps, or sculpturings.\nThe style and stigma of the flower are involved in most types of self incompatibility reactions. Self-incompatibility, if present, prevents fertilization by pollen from the same plant or from genetically similar plants, and ensures outcrossing.\nThe primitive development of carpels, as seen in such groups of plants as Tasmannia and Degeneria, lack styles and the stigmatic surface is produced along the carpels margins.\nStigmas and style of Cannabis sativa held in a pair of forceps\n\n\n\nStigma of a Crocus flower.\n\nSee also[edit]\nChalaza\n\nNotes[edit]\n^ carpel (also carpophyl)\u2014Gr. \u03ba\u03b1\u03c1\u03c0\u03cc\u03c2 (karp\u00f3s, \"fruit\") + Gr. \u03c6\u03cd\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd (ph\u00fallon, \"leaf\") [L. folium]."

    "content": "\nProteins are large biomolecules and macromolecules that comprise one or more long chains of amino acid residues. Proteins perform a vast array of functions within organisms, including catalysing metabolic reactions, DNA replication, responding to stimuli, providing structure to cells and organisms, and transporting molecules from one location to another. Proteins differ from one another primarily in their sequence of amino acids, which is dictated by the nucleotide sequence of their genes, and which usually results in protein folding into a specific 3D structure that determines its activity.\nA linear chain of amino acid residues is called a polypeptide. A protein contains at least one long polypeptide. Short polypeptides, containing less than 20\u201330 residues, are rarely considered to be proteins and are commonly called peptides. The individual amino acid residues are bonded together by peptide bonds and adjacent amino acid residues. The sequence of amino acid residues in a protein is defined by the sequence of a gene, which is encoded in the genetic code. In general, the genetic code specifies 20 standard amino acids; but in certain organisms the genetic code can include selenocysteine and\u2014in certain archaea\u2014pyrrolysine. Shortly after or even during synthesis, the residues in a protein are often chemically modified by post-translational modification, which alters the physical and chemical properties, folding, stability, activity, and ultimately, the function of the proteins. Some proteins have non-peptide groups attached, which can be called prosthetic groups or cofactors. Proteins can also work together to achieve a particular function, and they often associate to form stable protein complexes.\nOnce formed, proteins only exist for a certain period and are then degraded and recycled by the cell's machinery through the process of protein turnover. A protein's lifespan is measured in terms of its half-life and covers a wide range. They can exist for minutes or years with an average lifespan of 1\u20132 days in mammalian cells. Abnormal or misfolded proteins are degraded more rapidly either due to being targeted for destruction or due to being unstable.\nLike other biological macromolecules such as polysaccharides and nucleic acids, proteins are essential parts of organisms and participate in virtually every process within cells. Many proteins are enzymes that catalyse biochemical reactions and are vital to metabolism. Proteins also have structural or mechanical functions, such as actin and myosin in muscle and the proteins in the cytoskeleton, which form a system of scaffolding that maintains cell shape. Other proteins are important in cell signaling, immune responses, cell adhesion, and the cell cycle. In animals, proteins are needed in the diet to provide the essential amino acids that cannot be synthesized. Digestion breaks the proteins down for metabolic use.\nProteins may be purified from other cellular components using a variety of techniques such as ultracentrifugation, precipitation, electrophoresis, and chromatography; the advent of genetic engineering has made possible a number of methods to facilitate purification. Methods commonly used to study protein structure and function include immunohistochemistry, site-directed mutagenesis, X-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry.\n\nHistory and etymology\n\nFurther information: History of molecular biology\nProteins were recognized as a distinct class of biological molecules in the eighteenth century by Antoine Fourcroy and others, distinguished by the molecules' ability to coagulate or flocculate under treatments with heat or acid. Noted examples at the time included albumin from egg whites, blood serum albumin, fibrin, and wheat gluten.\nProteins were first described by the Dutch chemist Gerardus Johannes Mulder and named by the Swedish chemist J\u00f6ns Jacob Berzelius in 1838. Mulder carried out elemental analysis of common proteins and found that nearly all proteins had the same empirical formula, C400H620N100O120P1S1. He came to the erroneous conclusion that they might be composed of a single type of (very large) molecule. The term \"protein\" to describe these molecules was proposed by Mulder's associate Berzelius; protein is derived from the Greek word \u03c0\u03c1\u03ce\u03c4\u03b5\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 (proteios), meaning \"primary\", \"in the lead\", or \"standing in front\", + -in. Mulder went on to identify the products of protein degradation such as the amino acid leucine for which he found a (nearly correct) molecular weight of 131 Da. Prior to \"protein\", other names were used, like \"albumins\" or \"albuminous materials\" (Eiweissk\u00f6rper, in German).\nEarly nutritional scientists such as the German Carl von Voit believed that protein was the most important nutrient for maintaining the structure of the body, because it was generally believed that \"flesh makes flesh.\" Karl Heinrich Ritthausen extended known protein forms with the identification of glutamic acid. At the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station a detailed review of the vegetable proteins was compiled by Thomas Burr Osborne. Working with Lafayette Mendel and applying Liebig's law of the minimum in feeding laboratory rats, the nutritionally essential amino acids were established. The work was continued and communicated by William Cumming Rose. The understanding of proteins as polypeptides came through the work of Franz Hofmeister and Hermann Emil Fischer in 1902. The central role of proteins as enzymes in living organisms was not fully appreciated until 1926, when James B. Sumner showed that the enzyme urease was in fact a protein.\nThe difficulty in purifying proteins in large quantities made them very difficult for early protein biochemists to study. Hence, early studies focused on proteins that could be purified in large quantities, e.g., those of blood, egg white, various toxins, and digestive/metabolic enzymes obtained from slaughterhouses. In the 1950s, the Armour Hot Dog Co. purified 1\u00a0kg of pure bovine pancreatic ribonuclease A and made it freely available to scientists; this gesture helped ribonuclease A become a major target for biochemical study for the following decades.\nLinus Pauling is credited with the successful prediction of regular protein secondary structures based on hydrogen bonding, an idea first put forth by William Astbury in 1933. Later work by Walter Kauzmann on denaturation, based partly on previous studies by Kaj Linderstr\u00f8m-Lang, contributed an understanding of protein folding and structure mediated by hydrophobic interactions.\nThe first protein to be sequenced was insulin, by Frederick Sanger, in 1949. Sanger correctly determined the amino acid sequence of insulin, thus conclusively demonstrating that proteins consisted of linear polymers of amino acids rather than branched chains, colloids, or cyclols. He won the Nobel Prize for this achievement in 1958.\nJohn Kendrew with model of myoglobin in progress\nWith the development of X-ray crystallography, it became possible to sequence protein structures. The first protein structures to be solved were hemoglobin by Max Perutz and myoglobin by John Kendrew, in 1958. The use of computers and increasing computing power also supported the sequencing of complex proteins. In 1999, Roger Kornberg succeeded in sequencing the highly complex structure of RNA polymerase using high intensity X-rays from synchrotrons.\nSince then, cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) of large macromolecular assemblies has been developed. Cryo-EM uses protein samples that are frozen rather than crystals, and beams of electrons rather than x-rays. It causes less damage to the sample, allowing scientists to obtain more information and analyze larger structures. Computational protein structure prediction of small protein domains has also helped researchers to approach atomic-level resolution of protein structures.\nAs of 2017, the Protein Data Bank has over 126,060 atomic-resolution structures of proteins.\n\nNumber of proteins encoded in genomes\nThe number of proteins encoded in a genome roughly corresponds to the number of genes (although there may be a significant number of genes that encode RNA of protein, e.g. ribosomal RNAs). Viruses typically encode a few to a few hundred proteins, archaea and bacteria a few hundred to a few thousand, while eukaryotes typically encode a few thousand up to tens of thousands of proteins (see genome size for a list of examples).\n\nClassification\n\nMain articles: Protein family, Gene Ontology, and Enzyme Commission number\nProteins are primarily classified by sequence and structure, although other classifications are commonly used. Especially for enzymes the EC number system provides a functional classification scheme. Similarly, the gene ontology classifies both genes and proteins by their biological and biochemical function, but also by their intracellular location.\nSequence similarity is used to classify proteins both in terms of evolutionary and functional similarity. This may use either whole proteins or protein domains, especially in multi-domain proteins. Protein domains allow protein classification by a combination of sequence, structure and function, and thy can be combined in many different ways. In an early study of 170,000 proteins, about two-thirds were assigned at least one domain, with larger proteins containing more domains (e.g. proteins larger than 600 amino acids having an average of more than 5 domains).\n\nBiochemistry\nChemical structure of the peptide bond (bottom) and the three-dimensional structure of a peptide bond between an alanine and an adjacent amino acid (top/inset). The bond itself is made of the CHON elements.\nResonance structures of the peptide bond that links individual amino acids to form a protein polymer\n\nMain articles: Biochemistry, Amino acid, and Peptide bond\nMost proteins consist of linear polymers built from series of up to 20 different L-\u03b1- amino acids. All proteinogenic amino acids possess common structural features, including an \u03b1-carbon to which an amino group, a carboxyl group, and a variable side chain are bonded. Only proline differs from this basic structure as it contains an unusual ring to the N-end amine group, which forces the CO\u2013NH amide moiety into a fixed conformation. The side chains of the standard amino acids, detailed in the list of standard amino acids, have a great variety of chemical structures and properties; it is the combined effect of all of the amino acid side chains in a protein that ultimately determines its three-dimensional structure and its chemical reactivity.\nThe amino acids in a polypeptide chain are linked by peptide bonds. Once linked in the protein chain, an individual amino acid is called a residue, and the linked series of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen atoms are known as the main chain or protein backbone.\nThe peptide bond has two resonance forms that contribute some double-bond character and inhibit rotation around its axis, so that the alpha carbons are roughly coplanar. The other two dihedral angles in the peptide bond determine the local shape assumed by the protein backbone. The end with a free amino group is known as the N-terminus or amino terminus, whereas the end of the protein with a free carboxyl group is known as the C-terminus or carboxy terminus (the sequence of the protein is written from N-terminus to C-terminus, from left to right).\nThe words protein, polypeptide, and peptide are a little ambiguous and can overlap in meaning. Protein is generally used to refer to the complete biological molecule in a stable conformation, whereas peptide is generally reserved for a short amino acid oligomers often lacking a stable 3D structure. But the boundary between the two is not well defined and usually lies near 20\u201330 residues. Polypeptide can refer to any single linear chain of amino acids, usually regardless of length, but often implies an absence of a defined conformation.\nInteractions\nProteins can interact with many types of molecules, including with other proteins, with lipids, with carbohydrates, and with DNA.\nAbundance in cells\nIt has been estimated that average-sized bacteria contain about 2 million proteins per cell (e.g. E. coli and Staphylococcus aureus). Smaller bacteria, such as Mycoplasma or spirochetes contain fewer molecules, on the order of 50,000 to 1 million. By contrast, eukaryotic cells are larger and thus contain much more protein. For instance, yeast cells have been estimated to contain about 50 million proteins and human cells on the order of 1 to 3 billion. The concentration of individual protein copies ranges from a few molecules per cell up to 20 million. Not all genes coding proteins are expressed in most cells and their number depends on, for example, cell type and external stimuli. For instance, of the 20,000 or so proteins encoded by the human genome, only 6,000 are detected in lymphoblastoid cells.\n\nSynthesis\nBiosynthesis\nA ribosome produces a protein using mRNA as template\nThe DNA sequence of a gene encodes the amino acid sequence of a protein\n\nMain article: Protein biosynthesis\nProteins are assembled from amino acids using information encoded in genes. Each protein has its own unique amino acid sequence that is specified by the nucleotide sequence of the gene encoding this protein. The genetic code is a set of three-nucleotide sets called codons and each three-nucleotide combination designates an amino acid, for example AUG (adenine\u2013uracil\u2013guanine) is the code for methionine. Because DNA contains four nucleotides, the total number of possible codons is 64; hence, there is some redundancy in the genetic code, with some amino acids specified by more than one codon. Genes encoded in DNA are first transcribed into pre-messenger RNA (mRNA) by proteins such as RNA polymerase. Most organisms then process the pre-mRNA (also known as a primary transcript) using various forms of post-transcriptional modification to form the mature mRNA, which is then used as a template for protein synthesis by the ribosome. In prokaryotes the mRNA may either be used as soon as it is produced, or be bound by a ribosome after having moved away from the nucleoid. In contrast, eukaryotes make mRNA in the cell nucleus and then translocate it across the nuclear membrane into the cytoplasm, where protein synthesis then takes place. The rate of protein synthesis is higher in prokaryotes than eukaryotes and can reach up to 20 amino acids per second.\nThe process of synthesizing a protein from an mRNA template is known as translation. The mRNA is loaded onto the ribosome and is read three nucleotides at a time by matching each codon to its base pairing anticodon located on a transfer RNA molecule, which carries the amino acid corresponding to the codon it recognizes. The enzyme aminoacyl tRNA synthetase \"charges\" the tRNA molecules with the correct amino acids. The growing polypeptide is often termed the nascent chain. Proteins are always biosynthesized from N-terminus to C-terminus.\nThe size of a synthesized protein can be measured by the number of amino acids it contains and by its total molecular mass, which is normally reported in units of daltons (synonymous with atomic mass units), or the derivative unit kilodalton (kDa). The average size of a protein increases from Archaea to Bacteria to Eukaryote (283, 311, 438 residues and 31, 34, 49 kDa respectively) due to a bigger number of protein domains constituting proteins in higher organisms. For instance, yeast proteins are on average 466 amino acids long and 53 kDa in mass. The largest known proteins are the titins, a component of the muscle sarcomere, with a molecular mass of almost 3,000 kDa and a total length of almost 27,000 amino acids.\nChemical synthesis\n\nMain article: Peptide synthesis\nShort proteins can also be synthesized chemically by a family of methods known as peptide synthesis, which rely on organic synthesis techniques such as chemical ligation to produce peptides in high yield. Chemical synthesis allows for the introduction of non-natural amino acids into polypeptide chains, such as attachment of fluorescent probes to amino acid side chains. These methods are useful in laboratory biochemistry and cell biology, though generally not for commercial applications. Chemical synthesis is inefficient for polypeptides longer than about 300 amino acids, and the synthesized proteins may not readily assume their native tertiary structure. Most chemical synthesis methods proceed from C-terminus to N-terminus, opposite the biological reaction.\n\nStructure\nThe crystal structure of the chaperonin, a huge protein complex. A single protein subunit is highlighted. Chaperonins assist protein folding.\nThree possible representations of the three-dimensional structure of the protein triose phosphate isomerase.

The shape into which a protein naturally folds is known as its native conformation. Although many proteins can fold unassisted, simply through the chemical properties of their amino acids, others require the aid of molecular chaperones to fold into their native states. Biochemists often refer to four distinct aspects of a protein's structure:\nPrimary structure: the amino acid sequence. A protein is a polyamide.\nSecondary structure: regularly repeating local structures stabilized by hydrogen bonds. The most common examples are the \u03b1-helix, \u03b2-sheet and turns. Because secondary structures are local, many regions of different secondary structure can be present in the same protein molecule.\nTertiary structure: the overall shape of a single protein molecule; the spatial relationship of the secondary structures to one another. Tertiary structure is generally stabilized by nonlocal interactions, most commonly the formation of a hydrophobic core, but also through salt bridges, hydrogen bonds, disulfide bonds, and even post-translational modifications. The term \"tertiary structure\" is often used as synonymous with the term fold. The tertiary structure is what controls the basic function of the protein.\nQuaternary structure: the structure formed by several protein molecules (polypeptide chains), usually called protein subunits in this context, which function as a single protein complex.\nQuinary structure: the signatures of protein surface that organize the crowded cellular interior. Quinary structure is dependent on transient, yet essential, macromolecular interactions that occur inside living cells.\nProteins are not entirely rigid molecules. In addition to these levels of structure, proteins may shift between several related structures while they perform their functions. In the context of these functional rearrangements, these tertiary or quaternary structures are usually referred to as \"conformations\", and transitions between them are called conformational changes. Such changes are often induced by the binding of a substrate molecule to an enzyme's active site, or the physical region of the protein that participates in chemical catalysis. In solution, proteins also undergo variation in structure through thermal vibration and the collision with other molecules.\nMolecular surface of several proteins showing their comparative sizes. From left to right are: immunoglobulin G (IgG, an antibody), hemoglobin, insulin (a hormone), adenylate kinase (an enzyme), and glutamine synthetase (an enzyme).\nProteins can be informally divided into three main classes, which correlate with typical tertiary structures: globular proteins, fibrous proteins, and membrane proteins. Almost all globular proteins are soluble and many are enzymes. Fibrous proteins are often structural, such as collagen, the major component of connective tissue, or keratin, the protein component of hair and nails. Membrane proteins often serve as receptors or provide channels for polar or charged molecules to pass through the cell membrane.\nA special case of intramolecular hydrogen bonds within proteins, poorly shielded from water attack and hence promoting their own dehydration, are called dehydrons.\nProtein domains\n\nMain article: Protein domain\nMany proteins are composed of several protein domains, i.e. segments of a protein that fold into distinct structural units. Domains usually also have specific functions, such as enzymatic activities (e.g. kinase) or they serve as binding modules (e.g. the SH3 domain binds to proline-rich sequences in other proteins).\nSequence motif\nShort amino acid sequences within proteins often act as recognition sites for other proteins. For instance, SH3 domains typically bind to short PxxP motifs (i.e. 2 prolines [P], separated by two unspecified amino acids [x], although the surrounding amino acids may determine the exact binding specificity). Many such motifs has been collected in the Eukaryotic Linear Motif (ELM) database.\nProtein topology\nTopology of a protein describes the entanglement of the backbone and the arrangement of contacts within the folded chain. Two theoretical frameworks of knot theory and Circuit topology have been applied to characterise protein topology. Being able to describe protein topology opens up new pathways for protein engineering and pharmaceutical development, and adds to our understanding of protein misfolding diseases such as neuromuscular disorders and cancer.\n\nCellular functions\nProteins are the chief actors within the cell, said to be carrying out the duties specified by the information encoded in genes. With the exception of certain types of RNA, most other biological molecules are relatively inert elements upon which proteins act. Proteins make up half the dry weight of an Escherichia coli cell, whereas other macromolecules such as DNA and RNA make up only 3% and 20%, respectively. The set of proteins expressed in a particular cell or cell type is known as its proteome.\nThe enzyme hexokinase is shown as a conventional ball-and-stick molecular model. To scale in the top right-hand corner are two of its substrates, ATP and glucose.\nThe chief characteristic of proteins that also allows their diverse set of functions is their ability to bind other molecules specifically and tightly. The region of the protein responsible for binding another molecule is known as the binding site and is often a depression or \"pocket\" on the molecular surface. This binding ability is mediated by the tertiary structure of the protein, which defines the binding site pocket, and by the chemical properties of the surrounding amino acids' side chains. Protein binding can be extraordinarily tight and specific; for example, the ribonuclease inhibitor protein binds to human angiogenin with a sub-femtomolar dissociation constant (<10 M) but does not bind at all to its amphibian homolog onconase (>1 M). Extremely minor chemical changes such as the addition of a single methyl group to a binding partner can sometimes suffice to nearly eliminate binding; for example, the aminoacyl tRNA synthetase specific to the amino acid valine discriminates against the very similar side chain of the amino acid isoleucine.\nProteins can bind to other proteins as well as to small-molecule substrates. When proteins bind specifically to other copies of the same molecule, they can oligomerize to form fibrils; this process occurs often in structural proteins that consist of globular monomers that self-associate to form rigid fibers. Protein\u2013protein interactions also regulate enzymatic activity, control progression through the cell cycle, and allow the assembly of large protein complexes that carry out many closely related reactions with a common biological function. Proteins can also bind to, or even be integrated into, cell membranes. The ability of binding partners to induce conformational changes in proteins allows the construction of enormously complex signaling networks.\nAs interactions between proteins are reversible, and depend heavily on the availability of different groups of partner proteins to form aggregates that are capable to carry out discrete sets of function, study of the interactions between specific proteins is a key to understand important aspects of cellular function, and ultimately the properties that distinguish particular cell types.\nEnzymes\n\nMain article: Enzyme\nThe best-known role of proteins in the cell is as enzymes, which catalyse chemical reactions. Enzymes are usually highly specific and accelerate only one or a few chemical reactions. Enzymes carry out most of the reactions involved in metabolism, as well as manipulating DNA in processes such as DNA replication, DNA repair, and transcription. Some enzymes act on other proteins to add or remove chemical groups in a process known as posttranslational modification. About 4,000 reactions are known to be catalysed by enzymes. The rate acceleration conferred by enzymatic catalysis is often enormous\u2014as much as 10-fold increase in rate over the uncatalysed reaction in the case of orotate decarboxylase (78 million years without the enzyme, 18 milliseconds with the enzyme).\nThe molecules bound and acted upon by enzymes are called substrates. Although enzymes can consist of hundreds of amino acids, it is usually only a small fraction of the residues that come in contact with the substrate, and an even smaller fraction\u2014three to four residues on average\u2014that are directly involved in catalysis. The region of the enzyme that binds the substrate and contains the catalytic residues is known as the active site.\nDirigent proteins are members of a class of proteins that dictate the stereochemistry of a compound synthesized by other enzymes.\nCell signaling and ligand binding\n\nSee also: Glycan-protein interactions\nRibbon diagram of a mouse antibody against cholera that binds a carbohydrate antigen\nMany proteins are involved in the process of cell signaling and signal transduction. Some proteins, such as insulin, are extracellular proteins that transmit a signal from the cell in which they were synthesized to other cells in distant tissues. Others are membrane proteins that act as receptors whose main function is to bind a signaling molecule and induce a biochemical response in the cell. Many receptors have a binding site exposed on the cell surface and an effector domain within the cell, which may have enzymatic activity or may undergo a conformational change detected by other proteins within the cell.\nAntibodies are protein components of an adaptive immune system whose main function is to bind antigens, or foreign substances in the body, and target them for destruction. Antibodies can be secreted into the extracellular environment or anchored in the membranes of specialized B cells known as plasma cells. Whereas enzymes are limited in their binding affinity for their substrates by the necessity of conducting their reaction, antibodies have no such constraints. An antibody's binding affinity to its target is extraordinarily high.\nMany ligand transport proteins bind particular small biomolecules and transport them to other locations in the body of a multicellular organism. These proteins must have a high binding affinity when their ligand is present in high concentrations, but must also release the ligand when it is present at low concentrations in the target tissues. The canonical example of a ligand-binding protein is haemoglobin, which transports oxygen from the lungs to other organs and tissues in all vertebrates and has close homologs in every biological kingdom. Lectins are sugar-binding proteins which are highly specific for their sugar moieties. Lectins typically play a role in biological recognition phenomena involving cells and proteins. Receptors and hormones are highly specific binding proteins.\nTransmembrane proteins can also serve as ligand transport proteins that alter the permeability of the cell membrane to small molecules and ions. The membrane alone has a hydrophobic core through which polar or charged molecules cannot diffuse. Membrane proteins contain internal channels that allow such molecules to enter and exit the cell. Many ion channel proteins are specialized to select for only a particular ion; for example, potassium and sodium channels often discriminate for only one of the two ions.\nStructural proteins\nStructural proteins confer stiffness and rigidity to otherwise-fluid biological components. Most structural proteins are fibrous proteins; for example, collagen and elastin are critical components of connective tissue such as cartilage, and keratin is found in hard or filamentous structures such as hair, nails, feathers, hooves, and some animal shells. Some globular proteins can also play structural functions, for example, actin and tubulin are globular and soluble as monomers, but polymerize to form long, stiff fibers that make up the cytoskeleton, which allows the cell to maintain its shape and size.\nOther proteins that serve structural functions are motor proteins such as myosin, kinesin, and dynein, which are capable of generating mechanical forces. These proteins are crucial for cellular motility of single celled organisms and the sperm of many multicellular organisms which reproduce sexually. They also generate the forces exerted by contracting muscles and play essential roles in intracellular transport.\n\nProtein evolution\n\nMain article: Molecular evolution\nA key question in molecular biology is how proteins evolve, i.e. how can mutations (or rather changes in amino acid sequence) lead to new structures and functions? Most amino acids in a protein can be changed without disrupting activity or function, as can be seen from numerous homologous proteins across species (as collected in specialized databases for protein families, e.g. PFAM). In order to prevent dramatic consequences of mutations, a gene may be duplicated before it can mutate freely. However, this can also lead to complete loss of gene function and thus pseudo-genes. More commonly, single amino acid changes have limited consequences although some can change protein function substantially, especially in enzymes. For instance, many enzymes can change their substrate specificity by one or a few mutations. Changes in substrate specificity are facilitated by substrate promiscuity, i.e. the ability of many enzymes to bind and process multiple substrates. When mutations occur, the specificity of an enzyme can increase (or decrease) and thus its enzymatic activity. Thus, bacteria (or other organisms) can adapt to different food sources, including unnatural substrates such as plastic.\n\nMethods of study\n\nMain article: Protein methods\nThe activities and structures of proteins may be examined in vitro, in vivo, and in silico. In vitro studies of purified proteins in controlled environments are useful for learning how a protein carries out its function: for example, enzyme kinetics studies explore the chemical mechanism of an enzyme's catalytic activity and its relative affinity for various possible substrate molecules. By contrast, in vivo experiments can provide information about the physiological role of a protein in the context of a cell or even a whole organism. In silico studies use computational methods to study proteins.\nProtein purification\n\nMain article: Protein purification\nTo perform in vitro analysis, a protein must be purified away from other cellular components. This process usually begins with cell lysis, in which a cell's membrane is disrupted and its internal contents released into a solution known as a crude lysate. The resulting mixture can be purified using ultracentrifugation, which fractionates the various cellular components into fractions containing soluble proteins; membrane lipids and proteins; cellular organelles, and nucleic acids. Precipitation by a method known as salting out can concentrate the proteins from this lysate. Various types of chromatography are then used to isolate the protein or proteins of interest based on properties such as molecular weight, net charge and binding affinity. The level of purification can be monitored using various types of gel electrophoresis if the desired protein's molecular weight and isoelectric point are known, by spectroscopy if the protein has distinguishable spectroscopic features, or by enzyme assays if the protein has enzymatic activity. Additionally, proteins can be isolated according to their charge using electrofocusing.\nFor natural proteins, a series of purification steps may be necessary to obtain protein sufficiently pure for laboratory applications. To simplify this process, genetic engineering is often used to add chemical features to proteins that make them easier to purify without affecting their structure or activity. Here, a \"tag\" consisting of a specific amino acid sequence, often a series of histidine residues (a \"His-tag\"), is attached to one terminus of the protein. As a result, when the lysate is passed over a chromatography column containing nickel, the histidine residues ligate the nickel and attach to the column while the untagged components of the lysate pass unimpeded. A number of different tags have been developed to help researchers purify specific proteins from complex mixtures.\nCellular localization\nProteins in different cellular compartments and structures tagged with green fluorescent protein (here, white)\nThe study of proteins in vivo is often concerned with the synthesis and localization of the protein within the cell. Although many intracellular proteins are synthesized in the cytoplasm and membrane-bound or secreted proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum, the specifics of how proteins are targeted to specific organelles or cellular structures is often unclear. A useful technique for assessing cellular localization uses genetic engineering to express in a cell a fusion protein or chimera consisting of the natural protein of interest linked to a \"reporter\" such as green fluorescent protein (GFP). The fused protein's position within the cell can then be cleanly and efficiently visualized using microscopy, as shown in the figure opposite.\nOther methods for elucidating the cellular location of proteins requires the use of known compartmental markers for regions such as the ER, the Golgi, lysosomes or vacuoles, mitochondria, chloroplasts, plasma membrane, etc. With the use of fluorescently tagged versions of these markers or of antibodies to known markers, it becomes much simpler to identify the localization of a protein of interest. For example, indirect immunofluorescence will allow for fluorescence colocalization and demonstration of location. Fluorescent dyes are used to label cellular compartments for a similar purpose.\nOther possibilities exist, as well. For example, immunohistochemistry usually uses an antibody to one or more proteins of interest that are conjugated to enzymes yielding either luminescent or chromogenic signals that can be compared between samples, allowing for localization information. Another applicable technique is cofractionation in sucrose (or other material) gradients using isopycnic centrifugation. While this technique does not prove colocalization of a compartment of known density and the protein of interest, it does increase the likelihood, and is more amenable to large-scale studies.\nFinally, the gold-standard method of cellular localization is immunoelectron microscopy. This technique also uses an antibody to the protein of interest, along with classical electron microscopy techniques. The sample is prepared for normal electron microscopic examination, and then treated with an antibody to the protein of interest that is conjugated to an extremely electro-dense material, usually gold. This allows for the localization of both ultrastructural details as well as the protein of interest.\nThrough another genetic engineering application known as site-directed mutagenesis, researchers can alter the protein sequence and hence its structure, cellular localization, and susceptibility to regulation. This technique even allows the incorporation of unnatural amino acids into proteins, using modified tRNAs, and may allow the rational design of new proteins with novel properties.\nProteomics\n\nMain article: Proteomics\nThe total complement of proteins present at a time in a cell or cell type is known as its proteome, and the study of such large-scale data sets defines the field of proteomics, named by analogy to the related field of genomics. Key experimental techniques in proteomics include 2D electrophoresis, which allows the separation of many proteins, mass spectrometry, which allows rapid high-throughput identification of proteins and sequencing of peptides (most often after in-gel digestion), protein microarrays, which allow the detection of the relative levels of the various proteins present in a cell, and two-hybrid screening, which allows the systematic exploration of protein\u2013protein interactions. The total complement of biologically possible such interactions is known as the interactome. A systematic attempt to determine the structures of proteins representing every possible fold is known as structural genomics.\nStructure determination\nDiscovering the tertiary structure of a protein, or the quaternary structure of its complexes, can provide important clues about how the protein performs its function and how it can be affected, i.e. in drug design. As proteins are too small to be seen under a light microscope, other methods have to be employed to determine their structure. Common experimental methods include X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy, both of which can produce structural information at atomic resolution. However, NMR experiments are able to provide information from which a subset of distances between pairs of atoms can be estimated, and the final possible conformations for a protein are determined by solving a distance geometry problem. Dual polarisation interferometry is a quantitative analytical method for measuring the overall protein conformation and conformational changes due to interactions or other stimulus. Circular dichroism is another laboratory technique for determining internal \u03b2-sheet / \u03b1-helical composition of proteins. Cryoelectron microscopy is used to produce lower-resolution structural information about very large protein complexes, including assembled viruses; a variant known as electron crystallography can also produce high-resolution information in some cases, especially for two-dimensional crystals of membrane proteins. Solved structures are usually deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), a freely available resource from which structural data about thousands of proteins can be obtained in the form of Cartesian coordinates for each atom in the protein.\nMany more gene sequences are known than protein structures. Further, the set of solved structures is biased toward proteins that can be easily subjected to the conditions required in X-ray crystallography, one of the major structure determination methods. In particular, globular proteins are comparatively easy to crystallize in preparation for X-ray crystallography. Membrane proteins and large protein complexes, by contrast, are difficult to crystallize and are underrepresented in the PDB. Structural genomics initiatives have attempted to remedy these deficiencies by systematically solving representative structures of major fold classes. Protein structure prediction methods attempt to provide a means of generating a plausible structure for proteins whose structures have not been experimentally determined.\nStructure prediction\nConstituent amino-acids can be analyzed to predict secondary, tertiary and quaternary protein structure, in this case hemoglobin containing heme units\n\nMain articles: Protein structure prediction and List of protein structure prediction software\nComplementary to the field of structural genomics, protein structure prediction develops efficient mathematical models of proteins to computationally predict the molecular formations in theory, instead of detecting structures with laboratory observation. The most successful type of structure prediction, known as homology modeling, relies on the existence of a \"template\" structure with sequence similarity to the protein being modeled; structural genomics' goal is to provide sufficient representation in solved structures to model most of those that remain. Although producing accurate models remains a challenge when only distantly related template structures are available, it has been suggested that sequence alignment is the bottleneck in this process, as quite accurate models can be produced if a \"perfect\" sequence alignment is known. Many structure prediction methods have served to inform the emerging field of protein engineering, in which novel protein folds have already been designed. Also proteins (in eukaryotes ~33%) contain large unstructured but biologically functional segments and can be classified as intrinsically disordered proteins. Predicting and analysing protein disorder is, therefore, an important part of protein structure characterisation.\nBioinformatics\n\nMain article: Bioinformatics\nA vast array of computational methods have been developed to analyze the structure, function and evolution of proteins. The development of such tools has been driven by the large amount of genomic and proteomic data available for a variety of organisms, including the human genome. It is simply impossible to study all proteins experimentally, hence only a few are subjected to laboratory experiments while computational tools are used to extrapolate to similar proteins. Such homologous proteins can be efficiently identified in distantly related organisms by sequence alignment. Genome and gene sequences can be searched by a variety of tools for certain properties. Sequence profiling tools can find restriction enzyme sites, open reading frames in nucleotide sequences, and predict secondary structures. Phylogenetic trees can be constructed and evolutionary hypotheses developed using special software like ClustalW regarding the ancestry of modern organisms and the genes they express. The field of bioinformatics is now indispensable for the analysis of genes and proteins.\nIn silico simulation of dynamical processes\nA more complex computational problem is the prediction of intermolecular interactions, such as in molecular docking, protein folding, protein\u2013protein interaction and chemical reactivity. Mathematical models to simulate these dynamical processes involve molecular mechanics, in particular, molecular dynamics. In this regard, in silico simulations discovered the folding of small \u03b1-helical protein domains such as the villin headpiece, the HIV accessory protein and hybrid methods combining standard molecular dynamics with quantum mechanical mathematics have explored the electronic states of rhodopsins.\nBeyond classical molecular dynamics, quantum dynamics methods allow the simulation of proteins in atomistic detail with an accurate description of quantum mechanical effects. Examples include the multi-layer multi-configuration time-dependent Hartree (MCTDH) method and the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) approach, which have been applied to plant cryptochromes and bacteria light-harvesting complexes, respectively. Both quantum and classical mechanical simulations of biological-scale systems are extremely computationally demanding, so distributed computing initiatives (for example, the Folding@home project) facilitate the molecular modeling by exploiting advances in GPU parallel processing and Monte Carlo techniques.\nChemical analysis\nThe total nitrogen content of organic matter is mainly formed by the amino groups in proteins. The Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen (TKN) is a measure of nitrogen widely used in the analysis of (waste) water, soil, food, feed and organic matter in general. As the name suggests, the Kjeldahl method is applied. More sensitive methods are available.\n\nNutrition\n\nFurther information: Protein (nutrient) and Protein quality\nMost microorganisms and plants can biosynthesize all 20 standard amino acids, while animals (including humans) must obtain some of the amino acids from the diet. The amino acids that an organism cannot synthesize on its own are referred to as essential amino acids. Key enzymes that synthesize certain amino acids are not present in animals\u2014such as aspartokinase, which catalyses the first step in the synthesis of lysine, methionine, and threonine from aspartate. If amino acids are present in the environment, microorganisms can conserve energy by taking up the amino acids from their surroundings and downregulating their biosynthetic pathways.\nIn animals, amino acids are obtained through the consumption of foods containing protein. Ingested proteins are then broken down into amino acids through digestion, which typically involves denaturation of the protein through exposure to acid and hydrolysis by enzymes called proteases. Some ingested amino acids are used for protein biosynthesis, while others are converted to glucose through gluconeogenesis, or fed into the citric acid cycle. This use of protein as a fuel is particularly important under starvation conditions as it allows the body's own proteins to be used to support life, particularly those found in muscle.\nIn animals such as dogs and cats, protein maintains the health and quality of the skin by promoting hair follicle growth and keratinization, and thus reducing the likelihood of skin problems producing malodours. Poor-quality proteins also have a role regarding gastrointestinal health, increasing the potential for flatulence and odorous compounds in dogs because when proteins reach the colon in an undigested state, they are fermented producing hydrogen sulfide gas, indole, and skatole. Dogs and cats digest animal proteins better than those from plants, but products of low-quality animal origin are poorly digested, including skin, feathers, and connective tissue.\n\nSee also\nDeproteination\nDNA-binding protein\nMacromolecule\nIndex of protein-related articles\nIntein\nList of proteins\nProteopathy\nProteopedia\nProteolysis\nProtein sequence space\nProtein superfamily\n"

These are the decades considered to be the Golden Age of Detective Fiction.\n\nAuthors such as Dame Agatha Christie, Margaret Allingham, Gladys Mitchell, Dame Ngaio Marsh, Dorothy L Sayers, Patricia Wentworth, Josephine Tey would despatch their victims with some lethal concoctions.\n\n\u201cGive me a decent bottle of poison,\u201d Agatha Christie once said, \u201cand I\u2019ll construct the perfect crime.\u201d\n\nChristie used poison in her books more than any other murder method. It was a subject she was familiar with, having trained as an apothecary\u2019s assistant. She passed her exams in 1917 after receiving private tuition from a local commercial pharmacist.\n\nDuring the First World War, Christie spent time as a nurse and worked in the local hospital dispensary. When it came to drugs, she understood dosages and dispensing techniques.\n\n\n\nAgatha Christie Nursepng\n\nCyanide\n\nCyanide was Agatha Christie\u2019s particular favourite, and it featured more than any other poison in her novels, although she was also known to employ arsenic, strychnine, digitalis and morphine.\n\nCyanide works quickly, and a high concentration will kill in minutes. It can be inflicted as a colourless gas or in crystal form.\n\nCyanide is derived from the seeds of the Prunus family and can be found in plants such as cassava, lima beans and almonds. Pits and seeds of apricots, apples, and peaches can contain substantial amounts of chemicals that metabolise to cyanide. The edible parts of these fruits contain much lower amounts of these chemicals.\n\nChristie used cyanide in her novels Sparkling Cyanide, The Mirror Crack\u2019d from Side to Side, And Then There Were None, and A Pocketful of Rye.\n\n\n\n\nAgatha Christie Nurse WW1 smallerjpeg\nAgatha Christie when she was a nurse in the First World War\nArsenic\n\nArsenic was another favourite because it was so easy to obtain at that time. Arsenic was commonly bought in chemists as people would use it to make their own weedkiller and rat poison. The chemist would ask you to sign the poisons register when you bought it, so there would be a record of the purchase.\n\nArsenic was used in all sorts of products, including the inks and aniline dyes of printed wallpapers and clothing until as late as the 1920s. It was present in food colouring and beauty products such as arsenic complexion wafers that promised pure white skin.\n\nArsenic is a natural element widely found throughout the environment in the air, water and land. The biggest risk to public health comes from contaminated groundwater. Inorganic arsenic is naturally present at high levels in the groundwater in many countries.\n\nAs a tasteless and odourless white powder, arsenic is minimally soluble in cold water but dissolves easily in hot fluids such as tea or cocoa. The symptoms of arsenic poisoning include watery diarrhoea, causing dehydration and hypovolaemic shock. If it results in hepatic and renal impairment, there may be a garlic smell to the victim\u2019s breath.\n\nThe beauty of arsenic as a poison in crime fiction novels is that the symptoms of ingesting arsenic can be similar to those of other ailments. However, when a body is subjected to toxicological examination, arsenic is traceable.\n\nIn a famous case, a solicitor, Harold Greenwood, was accused of murdering his wife by arsenic poisoning. Her cause of death was certified by a doctor as heart disease. However, when Mabel Greenwood's body was exhumed, no evidence of heart disease was found, but 0.25 to 0.5 grains (16 to 32 mg) of arsenic was. See my post: The Mysterious Poisoning of Mabel Greenwood.\n\nArsenic plays a significant part in the plot of Agatha Christie\u2019s 4.50 From Paddington.\n\n\n\n450 from Paddingtonjpg\n\nStrychnine\n\nAmazingly, it\u2019s over 100 years since Christie\u2019s first published novel, The Mysterious Affair at Styles, hit the bookshelves, and Hercule Poirot made his first appearance. Strychnine was the poison of choice for Christie in this novel.\n\nStrychnine certainly produces a dramatic impact. 15 to 60 minutes after swallowing strychnine, the victim can have symptoms of agitation and apprehension or fear, depending on the dosage they\u2019ve ingested. Other symptoms can include restlessness, uncontrollable arching of the neck and back, rigid arms and legs, jaw tightness and painful muscle spasms that can lead to fever and kidney and liver injury.\n\nStrychnine is a strong poison, and only a small amount is needed to produce severe effects. It comes as a white, odourless, bitter crystalline powder that can be taken by mouth, inhaled, mixed in a solution, or injected directly into a vein.\n\nToday, strychnine is used primarily as a pesticide, particularly to kill rats.\n\n\n\nMysterious Affair at Styles 50jpeg\n\nAs well as arsenic, strychnine, and cyanide, Christie used eleven other poisons in her books, including hemlock, thallium and taxine. Derived from the leaves of the English yew tree, taxine was used to good effect in the novel A Pocketful of Rye.\n\n\n\nA Pocketful of Ryejpg\n\n\n\n\nThe Iris Woodmore Mysteries are available in hardback, paperback, ebook and audiobook from Amazon and bookstores.\n\nOrder now from Amazon\n\n\nSign up to be the first to hear of new releases, competitions and exclusive news from Michelle Salter\nDec 11, 2022\nCategory Crime fiction\nTags crime fiction historical crime fiction golden age of detective fiction crime writers agatha christie poison arsenic strychnine cyanide 1920s 1930s murder mystery novels josephine tey Margaret Allingham Gladys Mitchell Dame Ngaio Marsh Dorothy L Sayers\n\n"

## Overview

**Railtracks** is a lightweight framework for building agentic systems - modular, intelligent agents that can work together to solve complex tasks more effectively than any single module could.

**Railtracks-CLI** is a command-line tool designed to visualize your Railtracks runs. It's lightweight and can be run locally with **no sign-up required**.

---

## Installation

```bash
# Core library
pip install railtracks

# [Optional] CLI support for development and visualization
pip install railtracks-cli
```

## Why Railtracks?

Many frameworks for building LLM-powered applications focus on pipelines, chains, or prompt orchestration. While effective for simple use cases, they can become brittle or overly complex when handling asynchronous tasks, multi-step reasoning, and heterogeneous agents.

**Railtracks is designed with developers in mind to support real-world agentic systems** with an emphasis on:

* **Programmatic structure without rigidity** â€“ Unlike declarative workflows (e.g., LangChain), Railtracks encourages clean, Pythonic control flow.
* **Agent-first abstraction** â€“ Inspired by real-world coordination, Railtracks focuses on defining smart agents that collaborate via tools, not just chaining LLM calls.
* **Automatic Parallelism** â€“ Executions are automatically parallelized when possible, freeing you from managing threading or async manually.
* **Transparent Execution** â€“ Integrated logging, history tracing, and built-in visualizations show exactly how your system behaves.
* **Minimal API** â€“ The small, configurable API simplifies your workflow compared to other tools. No magic.
* **Visual Insights** â€“ Graph-based visualizations help you understand data flow and agent interactions at a glance.
* **Pluggable Models** â€“ Use any LLM provider: OpenAI, open-weight models, or your own local inference engine.

While frameworks like LangGraph emphasize pipelines, Railtracks aims to strike the perfect balance: powerful enough for complex systems, yet simple enough to understand, extend, and debug.

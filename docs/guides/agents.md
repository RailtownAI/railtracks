# :robot: What is an Agent? 
The buzz around AI terms can be pretty overwhelming and sound more like a buzzword than something useful. Before we dive
deep into how you can build agents in **Covailence**, lets first understand what an agent is.

An agent is a self-contained unit that can preform a specific task or set of tasks autonomously. It has the ability to
make decisions, take actions, and act within its environment to achieve its goals.

The key abilities of the agent include:

- **Autonomy**: Agents can operate independently within the boundaries you define

- **Adaptability**: Agents can adjust their behavior based on the environment and the tasks at hand

- **Goal-Oriented**: Agents are designed to achieve specific objectives or complete tasks

- **Interaction**: Agents can communicate with other agents or systems to gather information or perform actions

- **Stateful**: Agents maintain context and history and use it to inform their decisions

#  ðŸ§   LLMs have changed the game

Reinforcement Learning and other AI techniques which train specific agents to operate in their environment 
for a while now, but LLMs have changed the game and made it much easier to use their generalized intelligence to
accomplish complex tasks and goals. LLMs have the unique ability to understand instructions and reason about how they
want to accomplish the given task. This ability makes them uniquely suited to operate as the **brain** for your agentic 
system.

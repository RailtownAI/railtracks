# Model Context Protocol (MCP)
## What is Model Context Protocol (MCP)?
Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that enables seamless integration between Large Language Models (LLMs) and external systems, including applications, data sources, and tools. MCP provides a unified interface, making it easy for LLMs to access context, perform actions, and interact with diverse environments.
For you, this means that you can use powerful MCP tools without having to create them yourself.

## Using MCP tools in R C
R C allows you to covert MCP tools into Tools that can be used by R C agents just like any other Tool. We handle the conversion and server setup for you, so you can focus on building your agents without worrying about the underlying complexities of MCP.
Refer to the [Using MCP tools in RC](MCP_tools_in_RC.md) page for a guide and examples.

## R C to MCP
We also provide a way to convert R C Tools into MCP tools using FastMCP, allowing you to use your existing RC tools in any MCP-compatible environment.
See the [RC to MCP](RCtoMCP.md) page for more details on how to set this up.

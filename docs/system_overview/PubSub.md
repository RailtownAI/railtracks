# PubSub (Publish-Subscribe) Documentation

## Overview

The PubSub (Publish-Subscribe) system is a messaging pattern that allows different parts of the Request Completion system to communicate asynchronously. Think of it like a radio station: publishers broadcast messages (like radio shows), and subscribers listen for messages they're interested in (like tuning into specific stations).

## What is PubSub?

PubSub is a communication pattern where:

- **Publishers** send messages without knowing who will receive them
- **Subscribers** listen for messages they care about without knowing who sent them
- A **message broker** (in our case, the Publisher class) handles the routing

This creates loose coupling between components - they don't need to know about each other directly.

## What are Callbacks?

A **callback** is a function that gets called automatically when something happens. In the context of PubSub:

- You give the system a function (the callback)
- The system calls your function when a relevant message arrives
- Your function receives the message as a parameter

Example:
```python
def my_callback(message):
    print(f"Received: {message}")

# This callback will be called whenever a message is published
```

## Core Components

### 1. Messages (`messages.py`)

Messages are the data structures that flow through the PubSub system. All messages inherit from `RequestCompletionMessage`:

#### Base Message Class
- **`RequestCompletionMessage`**: The foundation for all messages in the system
  - Has a `log_message()` method for debugging

#### Request Lifecycle Messages
- **`RequestCreation`**: Sent when a new request is created
    - Contains: current node ID, new request ID, execution mode, node type, and arguments
- **`RequestSuccess`**: Sent when a request completes successfully
    - Contains: request ID, node state, and the result
- **`RequestFailure`**: Sent when a request fails during execution
    - Contains: request ID, node state, and the error
- **`RequestCreationFailure`**: Sent when request creation itself fails
    - Contains: request ID and the error

#### Special Messages
- **`FatalFailure`**: Indicates an irrecoverable system failure
- **`Streaming`**: Used for streaming data during execution
    - Contains: the streamed object and node ID

### 2. Publisher (`publisher.py`)

The Publisher is the central message broker that manages message distribution.

#### Basic Publisher Features
- **Asynchronous**: Uses `asyncio` for non-blocking operations
- **Ordered**: Messages are processed in the order they arrive
- **Thread-safe**: Multiple components can publish simultaneously

#### Key Methods

**Starting and Stopping:**
```python
publisher = Publisher()
await publisher.start()  # Start the message processing loop
await publisher.shutdown()  # Stop and cleanup
```

**Publishing Messages:**
```python
await publisher.publish(message)  # Send a message to all subscribers
```

**Subscribing:**
```python
def my_callback(message):
    print(f"Got message: {message}")

subscriber_id = publisher.subscribe(my_callback, name="my_subscriber")
```

**Unsubscribing:**
```python
publisher.unsubscribe(subscriber_id)  # Remove a specific subscriber
```

#### Advanced Features

**Listeners:**
Listeners wait for a specific message that matches criteria:
```python
# Wait for the first message that matches the filter
result = await publisher.listener(
    message_filter=lambda msg: isinstance(msg, RequestSuccess),
    result_mapping=lambda msg: msg.result,
    listener_name="success_listener"
)
```

**Context Manager Support:**
```python
async with Publisher() as pub:
    await pub.publish(message)
# Publisher automatically shuts down when exiting the context
```

### 3. Subscriber (`subscriber.py`)

Contains utilities for creating specialized subscribers.

#### Stream Subscriber
Converts streaming callbacks into proper message subscribers:
```python
def handle_stream_data(data):
    print(f"Streaming: {data}")

subscriber = stream_subscriber(handle_stream_data)
publisher.subscribe(subscriber)
```

### 4. Utilities (`utils.py`)

Helper functions for working with messages.

#### Output Mapping
Converts message results into their final outputs or raises errors:
```python
try:
    result = output_mapping(message)
    print(f"Success: {result}")
except Exception as error:
    print(f"Failed: {error}")
```

## Request Completion Publisher (RCPublisher)

`RCPublisher` is a specialized publisher for the Request Completion system that:

- Automatically logs all messages for debugging
- Handles Request Completion specific message types
- Provides built-in error logging with stack traces

```python
publisher = RCPublisher()
await publisher.start()
```

## Common Usage Patterns

### 1. Basic Message Publishing
```python
# Create and start publisher
async with RCPublisher() as publisher:
    # Create a message
    message = RequestSuccess(
        request_id="123",
        node_state=some_node_state,
        result="Hello World"
    )
    
    # Publish it
    await publisher.publish(message)
```

### 2. Subscribing to Specific Message Types
```python
def handle_success(message):
    if isinstance(message, RequestSuccess):
        print(f"Request {message.request_id} succeeded with: {message.result}")

def handle_failure(message):
    if isinstance(message, RequestFailure):
        print(f"Request {message.request_id} failed: {message.error}")

publisher.subscribe(handle_success, "success_handler")
publisher.subscribe(handle_failure, "failure_handler")
```

### 3. Waiting for Specific Results
```python
# Wait for a specific request to complete
result = await publisher.listener(
    message_filter=lambda msg: (
        isinstance(msg, (RequestSuccess, RequestFailure)) and 
        msg.request_id == "my_request_123"
    ),
    result_mapping=output_mapping,  # Convert to final result or raise error
    listener_name="request_waiter"
)
```

### 4. Streaming Data
```python
def process_stream(data):
    # Process each piece of streaming data
    print(f"Processing: {data}")

# Subscribe to streaming messages
stream_handler = stream_subscriber(process_stream)
publisher.subscribe(stream_handler, "stream_processor")
```

## Error Handling

The PubSub system handles errors gracefully:

1. **Subscriber Errors**: If a subscriber's callback fails, it's logged but doesn't affect other subscribers
2. **Publisher Errors**: Fatal errors are communicated through `FatalFailure` messages
3. **Request Errors**: Both creation and execution failures have specific message types

## Best Practices

1. **Always use descriptive names** for subscribers to aid debugging
2. **Handle errors in your callbacks** - don't let them crash the system
3. **Use context managers** when possible for automatic cleanup
4. **Filter messages efficiently** - check message types early in your callbacks
5. **Unsubscribe when done** to prevent memory leaks
6. **Use listeners for one-time responses** instead of persistent subscribers

## Thread Safety and Async Considerations

- The Publisher uses `asyncio.Queue` for thread-safe message handling
- All operations are asynchronous - always use `await`
- Messages are processed sequentially to maintain order
- The system gracefully handles shutdown during active operations

## Debugging Tips

1. **Enable debug logging** to see all message flows
2. **Use meaningful subscriber names** for easier log interpretation
3. **Check the `log_message()` output** for standardized message descriptions
4. **Monitor the publisher's running state** with `is_running()`
5. **Use the built-in logging subscriber** in RCPublisher for automatic message logging

This PubSub system provides a robust foundation for decoupled communication throughout the Request Completion framework, allowing components to interact without tight coupling while maintaining reliability and observability.

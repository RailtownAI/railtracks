# Agent Architectures

Agents come in all shapes and sizes. Picking the right architecture for your use case is what turns an average AI engineer into a superstar. Often, it can be difficult to decide between the many multi-agent patterns available.

In this section, we outline a small but growing set of agent architectures and show how they can be built using Railtracks. The exciting thing about Railtracks is that its interface allows you to design *your own* agent sequences. Architectures are written directly in Python logic, not constrained by a graphical editor, so there are no limits to how your agents connect, coordinate, or evolve.

The world is truly your oyster, with Railtracks guiding the way.

The same flow model supports multiple agent architectures without introducing new abstractions.

# Understanding RailTracks

Welcome to the RailTracks internals guide! ðŸš‚

**RailTracks** is built on a simple philosophy: complex systems should have simple APIs. No matter how sophisticated the backend, developers shouldn't need to wrestle with abstract concepts or confusing method names.

This guide breaks down RailTracks' architecture so you can understand how everything works under the hood. Whether you're looking to contribute or just curious about the internals, you'll find everything you need here.

## 1. Purpose

The Text Object Management component is designed to manage text resources by providing functionalities for metadata handling and content processing. It is primarily used to store and manage text-specific metadata and embeddings, which are essential for various text processing tasks.

### 1.1 Text Resource Management

This use case involves creating and managing text resources, including setting and retrieving metadata.

python
from railtracks.rag.text_object import TextObject

# Create a TextObject instance
text_obj = TextObject(raw_content="Sample text content", path="/path/to/text/file.txt")

# Retrieve metadata
metadata = text_obj.get_metadata()
print(metadata)


### 1.2 Text Content Processing

This use case demonstrates how to process text content by chunking and embedding.

python
# Set chunked content
text_obj.set_chunked(["chunk1", "chunk2", "chunk3"])

# Set embeddings
text_obj.set_embeddings([[0.1, 0.2], [0.3, 0.4], [0.5, 0.6]])

# Retrieve updated metadata
updated_metadata = text_obj.get_metadata()
print(updated_metadata)

## 3. Architectural Design

### 3.1 Design Considerations

- **ResourceInstance Class:** Serves as a base class for any resource object, providing common functionalities such as path normalization, name extraction, and hash generation.
- **TextObject Class:** Inherits from `ResourceInstance` and adds text-specific functionalities, including raw content storage, chunked content management, and embedding storage.

The design leverages inheritance to extend the capabilities of a generic resource instance to handle text-specific requirements. This approach promotes code reuse and modularity.

## 4. Important Considerations

### 4.1 Implementation Details

- **Path Normalization:** The `normalize_path` method ensures consistent path formatting across different operating systems.
- **Hash Generation:** The `get_resource_hash` method computes a SHA-256 hash of the file content, which is crucial for verifying data integrity.
- **Metadata Management:** The `get_metadata` method provides a comprehensive view of the text object's properties, including content-specific details like the number of chunks and embeddings.

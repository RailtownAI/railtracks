## 1. Purpose

The Vector Store Utilities component is designed to support various vector operations, including normalization and distance calculations, as well as generating unique identifiers and stable hashes. These utilities are essential for tasks such as vector similarity computations and ensuring data consistency.

### 1.1 Vector Normalization

Vector normalization is crucial for ensuring that vectors have a unit length, which is often required in machine learning and data processing tasks.

python
from vector_store.utils import normalize_vector

vector = [3.0, 4.0]
normalized_vector = normalize_vector(vector)
print(normalized_vector)  # Output: [0.6, 0.8]


### 1.2 Distance Calculation

Calculating the distance between vectors is fundamental for similarity measurements. This utility supports multiple metrics, including L2, dot product, and cosine similarity.

python
from vector_store.utils import distance

vector_a = [1.0, 2.0]
vector_b = [2.0, 3.0]
cosine_distance = distance(vector_a, vector_b, metric="cosine")
print(cosine_distance)

## 3. Architectural Design

The Vector Store Utilities component is designed with simplicity and efficiency in mind, providing essential operations without unnecessary complexity.

### 3.1 Design Considerations

- **Normalization Function:** Utilizes the Euclidean norm to scale vectors to unit length, ensuring compatibility with various machine learning algorithms.
- **Distance Function:** Supports multiple metrics, allowing flexibility in similarity computations. The choice of metric can significantly impact performance and accuracy.
- **UUID Generation:** Provides a straightforward method to generate unique identifiers, crucial for tracking and managing data entities.
- **Stable Hashing:** Uses SHA-256 to ensure consistent and secure hashing of text data, which is vital for data integrity and verification.

## 4. Important Considerations

### 4.1 Implementation Details

- **Vector Operations:** Ensure that vectors are non-empty to avoid division by zero during normalization.
- **Distance Metrics:** The choice of metric should align with the specific requirements of the application, as it affects the interpretation of similarity.
- **Hashing:** The `stable_hash` function is designed for text data; ensure input is properly encoded.

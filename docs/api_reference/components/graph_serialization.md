# Graph Serialization

The Graph Serialization component defines classes for representing edges and vertices in a graph structure, intended for use in a request system. This component is crucial for modeling relationships and dependencies within the system, allowing for efficient data serialization and deserialization.

## 1. Purpose

The Graph Serialization component is designed to facilitate the representation of graph structures through the `Edge` and `Vertex` classes. These classes are used to model the relationships and properties of nodes and edges within a graph, which is essential for request handling and data processing in the system.

### 1.1 Representing Edges

The `Edge` class models a connection between two vertices in a graph. It is crucial for defining the relationships and dependencies between different nodes.

python
from railtracks.utils.serialization.graph import Edge

edge = Edge(
    identifier="edge_1",
    source="vertex_1",
    target="vertex_2",
    stamp=some_stamp_instance,
    details={"weight": 5},
    parent=None
)


### 1.2 Representing Vertices

The `Vertex` class encapsulates the properties of a node in a graph, allowing for detailed representation of each vertex's attributes.

python
from railtracks.utils.serialization.graph import Vertex

vertex = Vertex(
    identifier="vertex_1",
    node_type="type_a",
    stamp=some_stamp_instance,
    details={"attribute": "value"},
    parent=None
)


## 2. Public API

### `class Edge`
No docstring found.

#### `.__init__(self)`
A simple representation of an edge in a graph structure.

This type is designed to be used as a request in the system and should not be extended for other uses.

Args:
    identifier (str | None): The unique identifier for the edge.
    source (str | None): The source vertex of the edge. None can be expected if the input does not have a source
    target (str): The target (sink) vertex of the edge.
    stamp (Stamp): A timestamp that is attached to this edge.
    details (dict[str, Any]): Additional details about the edge, which can include any relevant information.
    parent (Edge | None): An optional parent edge, this item should represent the temporal parent of the edge.


---
### `class Vertex`
No docstring found.

#### `.__init__(self)`
The Vertex class represents a single vertex in a graph structure.

This class is designed to encapsulate the properties that a node would have and should not be extended for use
cases outside of that

Args:
    identifier (str): The unique identifier for the vertex.
    node_type (str): The type of the node, which can be used to differentiate between different kinds of nodes.
    stamp (Stamp): A timestamp that represents a timestamp attached this vertex.
    details (dict[str, Any]): Additional details about the vertex, which can include any relevant information.
    Often times this should contain
    parent (Vertex | None): An optional parent vertex, this item should represent the temporal parent of the vertex.

## 3. Architectural Design

The Graph Serialization component is designed with simplicity and efficiency in mind, focusing on the core functionality of graph representation without unnecessary complexity.

### 3.1 Design Considerations

- **Edge Class:**
  - Designed to represent a directed connection between two vertices.
  - Includes attributes for identifier, source, target, timestamp, and additional details.
  - Ensures consistency by asserting that the parent edge, if present, matches the current edge's identifier, source, and target.

- **Vertex Class:**
  - Represents a single node in the graph with attributes for identifier, node type, timestamp, and additional details.
  - Ensures consistency by asserting that the parent vertex, if present, matches the current vertex's identifier.

## 4. Important Considerations

### 4.1 Implementation Details

- **Stamp Dependency:** The `Edge` and `Vertex` classes rely on a `Stamp` object from the `railtracks.utils.profiling` module, which must be correctly instantiated and passed to these classes.
- **Parent Consistency:** Both classes enforce consistency checks on parent-child relationships to maintain graph integrity.

## 1. Purpose

The Node Management component is designed to facilitate the creation and execution of nodes within the system. It provides an abstract base class, `Node`, which defines the core functionality and lifecycle of a node, including asynchronous invocation and state management. This component is essential for building scalable and efficient workflows that require asynchronous processing.

### 1.1 Node Creation and Execution

The primary use case of this component is to create and execute nodes that perform specific tasks asynchronously. This is crucial for applications that require non-blocking operations and efficient resource management.

python
class MyNode(Node):
    @classmethod
    def name(cls) -> str:
        return "My Custom Node"

    async def invoke(self) -> str:
        # Custom logic for node execution
        return "Node executed successfully"

# Usage
node = MyNode()
result = await node.tracked_invoke()
print(result)

## 3. Architectural Design

The Node Management component is built around the concept of nodes as asynchronous units of work. The design emphasizes flexibility, allowing developers to define custom nodes by extending the `Node` class and implementing the `invoke` method.

### 3.1 Node Class

- **Asynchronous Invocation:** The `Node` class ensures that the `invoke` method is always asynchronous, providing a wrapper if necessary.
- **Debugging and Latency Tracking:** Nodes can store debug information and track execution latency using `DebugDetails` and `LatencyDetails`.
- **State Management:** The `NodeState` class provides a mechanism to serialize and deserialize node states across process boundaries.

## 4. Important Considerations

### 4.1 Debugging and Performance

- **Debug Details:** Use the `DebugDetails` class to store and access debugging information during node execution.
- **Latency Tracking:** The `tracked_invoke` method automatically measures and records the execution time of the `invoke` method.

# Node Manifest

The Node Manifest component is responsible for creating a manifest for a tool, which includes a description and a list of parameters. This component is essential for node-based systems where tools need to be described and parameterized for effective integration and execution.

## 1. Purpose

The Node Manifest component is primarily used to encapsulate the metadata of a tool in node-based systems. This includes providing a clear description of the tool and specifying any parameters it requires. This is crucial for ensuring that tools can be correctly instantiated and utilized within the system.

### 1.1 Creating a Tool Manifest

The primary use case for this component is to create a manifest for a tool, which involves specifying a description and any parameters the tool might require.

python
from railtracks.nodes.manifest import ToolManifest
from railtracks.llm import Parameter

# Example of creating a tool manifest
description = "This tool processes data and returns results."
parameters = [Parameter(name="input_data", type="str", description="The data to process.")]
tool_manifest = ToolManifest(description=description, parameters=parameters)


## 2. Public API

### `class ToolManifest`
Creates a manifest for a tool, which includes its description and parameters.

Args:
    description (str): A description of the tool.
    parameters (Iterable[Parameter] | None): An iterable of parameters for the tool. If None, there are no paramerters.

#### `.__init__(self, description, parameters)`
Class constructor.

## 3. Architectural Design

The Node Manifest component is designed to be a lightweight and flexible way to describe tools within a node-based system. It leverages Python's typing system to ensure that parameters are clearly defined and can be easily validated.

### 3.1 ToolManifest Class

- **Description and Parameters:** The `ToolManifest` class is designed to hold a tool's description and its parameters. This design choice allows for easy extension and integration with other components that require tool metadata.
- **Use of Typing:** The use of `Iterable[Parameter]` for parameters ensures that the component can handle a wide range of parameter configurations, providing flexibility in how tools are described.

## 4. Important Considerations

### 4.1 Parameter Handling

- The `ToolManifest` class uses the `Parameter` class from `railtracks.llm`. Ensure that the `Parameter` class is correctly imported and utilized to avoid runtime errors.
- When no parameters are provided, the `ToolManifest` initializes with an empty list, ensuring that the absence of parameters does not lead to unexpected behavior.

## 1. Purpose

The Serialization component is primarily used to convert complex objects into a JSON-compatible format. This is essential for tasks such as logging, data storage, and inter-process communication where JSON is the preferred data interchange format.

### 1.1 Encoding Complex Objects

The component supports encoding a variety of complex objects, including but not limited to `Edge`, `Vertex`, `Stamp`, `RequestDetails`, `Message`, `ToolResponse`, `ToolCall`, `LatencyDetails`, and Pydantic's `BaseModel`. This is crucial for ensuring that these objects can be easily serialized and deserialized across different parts of the system.

python
from railtracks.state.serialize import RTJSONEncoder
import json

# Example of encoding a complex object
edge = Edge(source="A", target="B", identifier="edge1", stamp=Stamp(...), details={}, parent=None)
json_data = json.dumps(edge, cls=RTJSONEncoder)


## 2. Public API

### `def encoder_extender(o)`
Extends the encoding of supported types to their dictionary representation.

We support the following types as of right now:
- Edge
- Vertex
- Stamp
- RequestDetails
- Message
- ToolResponse
- ToolCall
- LatencyDetails
- BaseModel (Pydantic models)


---
### `def encode_tool_call(tool_call)`
Encodes a ToolCall object to a dictionary representation.


---
### `def encode_latency_details(latency_details)`
Encodes LatencyDetails to a dictionary representation.


---
### `def encode_edge(edge)`
Encodes an Edge object to a dictionary representation.


---
### `def encode_vertex(vertex)`
Encodes a Vertex object to a dictionary representation.


---
### `def encode_stamp(stamp)`
Encodes a Stamp object to a dictionary representation.


---
### `def encode_request_details(details)`
Encodes a RequestDetails object to a dictionary representation.


---
### `def encode_message(message)`
Encodes a Message object to a dictionary representation.


---
### `def encode_content(content)`
No docstring found.


---
### `def encode_base_model(model)`
Encodes a BaseModel object to a dictionary representation.


---
### `class RTJSONEncoder(json.JSONEncoder)`
A custom JSON encoder that extends the default JSONEncoder to handle specific types used in the system.

Please consult `supported_types` for the list of supported types.

#### `.default(self, o)`
No docstring found.

## 3. Architectural Design

The Serialization component is designed to extend the default JSON encoding capabilities by providing a custom encoder, `RTJSONEncoder`, which leverages the `encoder_extender` function to handle specific object types. This design allows for flexibility and scalability, as new object types can be easily added to the `supported_types` tuple and corresponding encoding functions can be implemented.

### 3.1 Design Considerations

- **Extensibility:** The use of a custom encoder allows for easy extension to support new object types.
- **Maintainability:** The current design suggests refactoring the `encoder_extender` function to use a mapping of types to encoding functions for better scalability and maintainability.
- **Error Handling:** The `RTJSONEncoder` provides a fallback mechanism to handle unsupported types by returning a string representation of the object.

## 4. Important Considerations

### 4.1 Implementation Details

- **Dependencies:** The component relies on the `pydantic` library for handling `BaseModel` objects.
- **Performance:** The custom encoder is designed to efficiently handle serialization of complex objects, but performance may vary depending on the size and complexity of the objects being serialized.
- **Error Handling:** Unsupported types are handled gracefully by the `RTJSONEncoder`, which attempts to convert them to a string representation.

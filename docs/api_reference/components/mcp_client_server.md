## 1. Purpose

The MCP Client and Server component is designed to facilitate the integration of external tools and services into the RailTracks framework using the Model Context Protocol (MCP). It provides an asynchronous client and server setup to communicate with MCP servers via stdio or HTTP streaming, allowing developers to leverage a standardized interface for tool integration.

### 1.1 Connecting to an MCP Server

This use case demonstrates how to connect to an MCP server using the `MCPAsyncClient` class. It is crucial for initializing communication with the server and accessing available tools.

python
from railtracks.rt_mcp import MCPHttpParams, MCPAsyncClient

config = MCPHttpParams(url="https://remote.mcpservers.org/fetch/mcp")
client = MCPAsyncClient(config=config)
await client.connect()


### 1.2 Listing Available Tools

Once connected to an MCP server, you can list all available tools using the `list_tools` method. This is important for understanding the capabilities provided by the server.

python
tools = await client.list_tools()


## 2. Public API



## 3. Architectural Design

The MCP Client and Server component is designed to provide a flexible and efficient way to interact with MCP servers. It leverages asynchronous programming to handle communication, ensuring non-blocking operations and efficient resource utilization.

### 3.1 Core Design Principles

- **Asynchronous Communication:** Utilizes Python's `asyncio` library to manage asynchronous operations, allowing for non-blocking communication with MCP servers.
- **Standardized Integration:** Follows the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to ensure compatibility with a wide range of tools and services.
- **Modular Design:** Separates client and server functionalities into distinct classes (`MCPAsyncClient` and `MCPServer`) to promote modularity and ease of maintenance.

## 4. Important Considerations

### 4.1 Dependencies & Setup

- Ensure that the MCP server URL is correctly configured in the `MCPHttpParams`.
- The component relies on the `mcp` package for client session management and communication protocols.

### 4.2 Performance & Limitations

- The component is designed for asynchronous operations; ensure that the event loop is properly managed to avoid blocking.
- The `MCPAsyncClient` caches tool information to reduce redundant requests, improving performance.

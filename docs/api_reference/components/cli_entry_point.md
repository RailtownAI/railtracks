# CLI Entry Point

The CLI Entry Point serves as the entry point for the railtracks command-line interface (CLI) when executed as a module. It is a crucial component that initializes the CLI application, allowing users to interact with the railtracks system through command-line commands.

## 1. Purpose

The primary purpose of the CLI Entry Point is to serve as the main execution point for the railtracks CLI. It allows users to run the CLI by executing the module directly, which in turn calls the main function from the `railtracks_cli` package.

### 1.1 Executing the CLI

The CLI Entry Point is executed when the module is run directly. This is typically done using the command:

bash
python -m railtracks_cli


This command triggers the `__main__.py` file, which imports and calls the `main` function from the `railtracks_cli` package.

## 2. Public API



## 3. Architectural Design

The design of the CLI Entry Point is straightforward, focusing on simplicity and ease of use. The primary responsibility of this component is to act as a bridge between the command-line execution and the CLI logic defined in the `railtracks_cli` package.

### 3.1 Design Considerations

- **Simplicity:** The entry point is designed to be minimal, with the sole purpose of invoking the `main` function.
- **Modularity:** By delegating the CLI logic to the `railtracks_cli` package, the entry point remains clean and focused on its primary task.
- **Ease of Use:** Users can easily execute the CLI by running the module, without needing to know the internal structure of the package.

## 4. Important Considerations

- **Dependencies:** The CLI Entry Point depends on the `railtracks_cli` package, specifically the `main` function. Ensure that this package is correctly installed and accessible in the Python environment.
- **Execution Context:** The entry point should be executed in an environment where the `railtracks_cli` package is available. This is typically the case when the package is installed in the Python environment.

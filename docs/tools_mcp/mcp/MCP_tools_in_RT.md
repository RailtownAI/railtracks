# Using MCP Tools in Railtracks

## Overview

!!! tip "Quick Summary"
    Railtracks makes it easy to use any MCP-compatible tool with your agents. Just connect to an MCP server, get the tools, and start using them!

Railtracks supports seamless integration with [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](mcp.md), allowing you to use any MCP-compatible tool as a native Railtracks Tool. This means you can connect your agents to a wide variety of external tools and data sourcesâ€”without having to implement the tool logic yourself. 

Railtracks handles the discovery and invocation of MCP tools, so you can focus on building intelligent agents.

## Prerequisites

!!! note "Before You Begin"
    Make sure you have the following set up before using MCP tools:

    - **Railtracks Framework** installed (`pip install railtracks[core]`)
    - **MCP package set up** - Every MCP tool has different requirements (see specific tool documentation)
    - **Authentication credentials** - Many MCP tools require API keys or OAuth tokens

## Connecting to MCP Server Types

Railtracks supports two types of MCP servers

!!! Tip "Remote HTTP Servers"

    Use `MCPHttpParams` for connecting to remote MCP servers:

    ```python
    --8<-- "docs/scripts/MCP_tools_in_RT.py:http_example"
    ```

!!! Tip "Local Stdio Servers"

    Use `MCPStdioParams` for running local MCP servers:

    ```python
    --8<-- "docs/scripts/MCP_tools_in_RT.py:stdio_example"
    ```

## Using MCP Tools with Railtracks Agents

Once you've connected to an MCP server, you can use the tools with your Railtracks agents:

```python
--8<-- "docs/scripts/MCP_tools_in_RT.py:stdio_example"
```

## Common MCP Server Examples

??? Tip "Fetch Server (URL Content Retrieval)"
    ```python
    --8<-- "docs/scripts/MCP_tools_in_RT.py:web_search_example"
    ```
    Guide: [Websearch Server](../guides/websearch_integration.md)

??? Tip "GitHub Server"
    

    ```python
    --8<-- "docs/scripts/MCP_tools_in_RT.py:github_example"
    ```

    Guide: [Github Server](../guides/github.md)


    !!! Warning
        If you fail to provde the correct PAT you will see the following error:
        
        ```
        Exception in thread Thread-1 (_thread_main):

        Traceback (most recent call last):
        
        File "C:\Users\rc\.venv\lib\site-packages\anyio\streams\memory.py", line 111, in receive
        ```

??? Tip "Notion Server"
    
    ```python
    --8<-- "docs/scripts/MCP_tools_in_RT.py:notion_example"
    ```
    Guide: [Notion Server](../guides/notion.md)
    

## Combining Multiple MCP Tools

You can combine tools from different MCP's into one single agent. 

```python
--8<-- "docs/scripts/MCP_tools_in_RT.py:multiple_mcps"
```

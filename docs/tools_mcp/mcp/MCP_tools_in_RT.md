# Using MCP Tools in RailTracks

## Overview

!!! tip "Quick Summary"
    RailTracks makes it easy to use any MCP-compatible tool with your agents. Just connect to an MCP server, get the tools, and start using them!

RailTracks supports seamless integration with [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](mcp.md), allowing you to use any MCP-compatible tool as a native RailTracks Tool. This means you can connect your agents to a wide variety of external tools and data sourcesâ€”without having to implement the tool logic yourself. 

RailTracks handles the discovery and invocation of MCP tools, so you can focus on building intelligent agents.

## Prerequisites

!!! note "Before You Begin"
    Make sure you have the following set up before using MCP tools:

- **RailTracks Framework** installed (`pip install railtracks`)
- **MCP package set up** - Every MCP tool has different requirements (see specific tool documentation)
- **Authentication credentials** - Many MCP tools require API keys or OAuth tokens

## Connecting to MCP Servers

RailTracks supports two types of MCP servers:

### 1. Remote HTTP Servers

Use `MCPHttpParams` for connecting to remote MCP servers:

```python
import os
from railtracks.nodes.library import connect_mcp
from railtracks.rt_mcp import MCPHttpParams

# Connect to a remote MCP server
fetch_server = connect_mcp(
    MCPHttpParams(
        url="https://remote.mcpservers.org/fetch/mcp",
        # Optional: Add authentication headers if needed
        headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {os.getenv('API_KEY')}"}
    )
)
```

### 2. Local Command-Line Servers

Use `MCPStdioParams` for running local MCP servers:

```python
from railtracks.nodes.library import connect_mcp
from railtracks.rt_mcp import MCPStdioParams

# Run a local MCP server (Time server example)
time_server = connect_mcp(
    MCPStdioParams(
        command="npx",  # or other command to run the server
        args=["mcp-server-time"]
    )
)
```

## Using MCP Tools with RailTracks Agents

Once you've connected to an MCP server, you can use the tools with your RailTracks agents:

```python
import railtracks as rt
from railtracks.nodes.library import connect_mcp
from railtracks.rt_mcp import MCPHttpParams

# Connect to an MCP server (example with Fetch server)
fetch_server = connect_mcp(MCPHttpParams(url="https://remote.mcpservers.org/fetch/mcp"))
tools = fetch_server.tools  # List of RailTracks Tool Nodes

# Create an agent that can use these tools
agent = rt.library.tool_call_llm(
    tool_nodes=tools,
    name="Web Research Agent",
    system_message="Use the tools to research information online.",
    llm=rt.llm.OpenAILLM("gpt-4o"),
)

# Use the agent
with rt.Session():
    result = await rt.call(
        agent,
        "Find information about RailTracks"
    )
    print(result.content)
```

## Common MCP Server Examples

### Fetch Server (URL Content Retrieval)

```python
import railtracks as rt
from railtracks.nodes.library import connect_mcp
from railtracks.rt_mcp import MCPHttpParams

# Connect to the Fetch MCP server
fetch_server = connect_mcp(MCPHttpParams(url="https://remote.mcpservers.org/fetch/mcp"))
fetch_tools = fetch_server.tools
```

### GitHub Server

```python
import os
import railtracks as rt
from railtracks.nodes.library import connect_mcp
from railtracks.rt_mcp import MCPHttpParams

# Connect to the GitHub MCP server
github_server = connect_mcp(
    MCPHttpParams(
        url="https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/",
        headers={
            "Authorization": f"Bearer {os.getenv('GITHUB_PAT_TOKEN')}",
        },
    )
)
github_tools = github_server.tools
```


!!! Warning
    You must set your github token in your .env file or you will see an error like:
    
    Exception in thread Thread-1 (_thread_main):

    Traceback (most recent call last):
    
    File "C:\Users\rc\.venv\lib\site-packages\anyio\streams\memory.py", line 111, in receive

### Notion Server

```python
import json
import os
import railtracks as rt
from railtracks.nodes.library import connect_mcp
from railtracks.rt_mcp import MCPStdioParams

# Connect to the Notion MCP server
notion_server = connect_mcp(
    MCPStdioParams(
        command="npx",
        args=["-y", "@notionhq/notion-mcp-server"],
        env={
            "OPENAPI_MCP_HEADERS": json.dumps({
                "Authorization": f"Bearer {os.environ['NOTION_API_TOKEN']}",
                "Notion-Version": "2022-06-28"
            })
        },
    )
)
notion_tools = notion_server.tools
```

## Combining Multiple MCP Tools

You can combine tools from different MCP servers to create powerful agents:

```python
import railtracks as rt
from railtracks.nodes.library import connect_mcp
from railtracks.rt_mcp import MCPHttpParams, MCPStdioParams
import os
import json

# Set up servers and get tools
fetch_server = connect_mcp(MCPHttpParams(url="https://remote.mcpservers.org/fetch/mcp"))
fetch_tools = fetch_server.tools

github_server = connect_mcp(
    MCPHttpParams(
        url="https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/",
        headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {os.getenv('GITHUB_PAT_TOKEN')}"},
    )
)
github_tools = github_server.tools

notion_server = connect_mcp(
    MCPStdioParams(
        command="npx",
        args=["-y", "@notionhq/notion-mcp-server"],
        env={
            "OPENAPI_MCP_HEADERS": json.dumps({
                "Authorization": f"Bearer {os.environ['NOTION_API_TOKEN']}",
                "Notion-Version": "2022-06-28"
            })
        },
    )
)
notion_tools = notion_server.tools

# Combine tools from multiple servers
all_tools = fetch_tools + github_tools + notion_tools

# Create an agent that can use all tools
super_agent = rt.library.tool_call_llm(
    tool_nodes=all_tools,
    name="Multi-Tool Agent",
    system_message="Use the appropriate tools to complete tasks.",
    llm=rt.llm.OpenAILLM("gpt-4o"),
)
```

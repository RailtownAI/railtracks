  <h1> RailTracks Agentic Framework</h1>
</div>


RailTracks is a streamlined agentic workflow creation tool that allows users to quickly prototype, test, and 
deploy agentic workflows. The foundational principles of RailTracks were designed to make the process of
creating agents an exercise in writing code, not writing a configuration file.

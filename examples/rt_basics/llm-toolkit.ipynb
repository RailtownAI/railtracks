      "Definite integral using FTC: 1/3\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "In this expanded explanation:\n",
      "1. We define the symbolic variable `x` using `sympy.Symbol`.\n",
      "2. We define the function `f` that we want to integrate, which is `x**2`.\n",
      "3. We calculate the indefinite integral of `f` with respect to `x` using `sympy.integrate(f, x)`. The result is `x**3/3`.\n",
      "4. We calculate the definite integral of `f` from 0 to 1 using `sympy.integrate(f, (x, 0, 1))`. The result is `1/3`.\n",
      "5. Alternatively, we can calculate the definite integral using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (FTC). According to the FTC, the definite integral of a function `f` from `a` to `b` is equal to `F(b) - F(a)`, where `F` is an antiderivative of `f`. In this case, the antiderivative of `x**2` is `x**3/3`, so we evaluate `x**3/3` at `x=1` and `x=0` and subtract the results. This gives us the same result of `1/3`.\n",

The company has operated since the late 1990s and is one of the most fundamental forces in the development of the internet as we know it – to the point where the phrase ‘googling’ is synonymous with using a search engine. While the search engine is the company’s flagship product, Google operates in numerous areas including hardware, cloud computing, advertising, software and AI. Google is now under the umbrella of Alphabet Inc., a publicly traded company with multiple classes of shareholders. Like many of the major public-facing tech companies, advertising is at the heart of Google’s business model. The company uses its AdSense and DoubleClick platforms to perform targeted advertising both on the search engine and on third-party websites via Google Ads. Google, including its full suite of products and services, is just one subsidiary of Alphabet. In 2014, Google purchased British artificial intelligence company DeepMind before it came under the banner of Alphabet during the company restructuring in 2015.\n",

Google is an American search engine company, founded in 1998 by Sergey Brin and Larry Page. Since 2015, Google has been a subsidiary of the holding company Alphabet, Inc. More than 70% of worldwide online search requests are handled by Google, placing it at the heart of most Internet users’ experience. Google began as an online search firm, but it now offers more than 50 Internet services and products, from e-mail and online document creation to software for mobile phones and tablet computers. In 2023, Alphabet took in $175 billion in revenue (57% of all Google revenue) from advertising based on users’ search requests. That growth only continued; by the end of 2011, Google was handling some three billion searches per day.

    "\n",
    "# RESEARCH METHODOLOGY\n",
    "\n",
    "## Phase 1: Strategic Planning (Use Thought Management)\n",
    "Before searching, you MUST use the thought management tools to plan your approach:\n",
    "- Use `add_thought` to brainstorm: What industries would need this product? What company characteristics indicate a good fit?\n",
    "- Document your search strategy: What search queries will you run? What signals will you look for?\n",
    "- Create a research checklist of information you need to gather for each company\n",
    "\n",
    "## Phase 2: Broad Discovery\n",
    "- Execute broad searches to identify potential companies in relevant industries\n",
    "- Cast a wide net - look for companies that MIGHT fit based on industry, size, or business model\n",
    "- Use `add_thought` to track promising leads and patterns you notice\n",
    "- Use `resolve_thoughts` to mark completed searches and document findings\n",
    "\n",
    "## Phase 3: Company Qualification (Multi-Pass)\n",
    "For each promising company, conduct a focused investigation:\n",
    "\n",
    "**First Pass - Basic Fit:**\n",
    "- Confirm the company is real and active\n",
    "- Verify industry alignment with the product offering\n",
    "- Check approximate company size (employees)\n",
    "- Initial assessment: Does this seem like a prospect worth investigating further?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Second Pass - Deeper Details:**\n",
    "- Find specific employee count and revenue estimates\n",
    "- Identify their current tech stack or tools (look at job postings, tech detection sites, engineering blogs, case studies)\n",
    "- Find their LinkedIn company page\n",
    "- Determine WHY they would need your product offering\n",
    "\n",
    "**Between passes:** Use `review_thoughts` regularly to ensure you're staying on track and haven't missed anything.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Phase 4: Documentation & Finalization\n",
    "- Use `resolve_thoughts` to mark each company as fully researched\n",
    "- Ensure you have 10-20 high-confidence companies\n",
    "- Double-check that each company has all required fields, especially LinkedIn URLs\n",
    "\n",
    "# CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Always use thought management tools BEFORE conducting research**\n",
    "   - Never start searching without first planning your approach\n",
    "   - Regularly check in with your thought list to track progress\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Only include HIGH CONFIDENCE companies**\n",
    "   - You must be confident in the fit between the company and the product\n",
    "   - If you can't find sufficient information, move on to other prospects\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Maximum 20 companies**\n",
    "   - Focus on quality over quantity\n",
    "   - Better to have 12 excellent prospects than 20 mediocre ones\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **LinkedIn is mandatory**\n",
    "   - Every company MUST have a LinkedIn URL\n",
    "   - This is critical for downstream processes\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Think about the pitch angle**\n",
    "   - For each company, you should have a clear sense of why they need this product\n",
    "   - This helps you evaluate fit and will be documented in `why_good_fit`\n",
    "\n",
    "# SEARCH STRATEGY TIPS\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use multiple search queries per industry vertical\n",
    "- Look for recent news, funding announcements, or growth signals\n",
    "- Check job postings to understand their tech stack and pain points\n",
    "- Cross-reference multiple sources to verify company information\n",

    "2. A product offering we want to sell to this company\n",
    "\n",
    "Your job is to find 5-10 relevant contacts at this company who would be involved in evaluating, purchasing, or implementing this type of product.\n",
    "\n",
    "# WHO TO FIND\n",
    "\n",
    "Focus on decision-makers and influencers who would be involved in the buying process:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Primary Targets (High Priority):**\n",
    "- C-Suite executives (CEO, CTO, CIO, CDO, etc.) at smaller companies (<200 employees)\n",
    "- VPs and Directors (Engineering, Product, Operations, IT, Data, etc.)\n",
    "- Heads of relevant departments\n",
    "\n",
    "**Secondary Targets (Medium Priority):**\n",

    "- Technical leads or architects who influence tool selection\n",
    "- Product managers overseeing relevant areas\n",

    "# RESEARCH METHODOLOGY\n",
    "\n",
    "## Phase 1: Strategic Planning (Use Thought Management)\n",
    "Before searching, use thought management tools to plan:\n",
    "- Use `add_thought` to identify: What roles/titles would be involved in buying this product?\n",
    "- Document your search strategy: Where will you look? What keywords will you use?\n",
    "- Create a checklist of information to gather for each contact\n",
    "\n",
    "## Phase 2: Broad Contact Discovery\n",
    "Execute searches to find potential contacts:\n",
    "- Search LinkedIn for employees with relevant titles\n",
    "- Look at the company's \"About\" or \"Team\" pages\n",
    "- Check recent press releases or news for quoted executives\n",
    "- Review conference speaker lists, podcast appearances, webinars\n",
    "- Look at GitHub contributors (for technical products)\n",
    "- Use `add_thought` to track promising contacts and patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "## Phase 3: Contact Qualification (Multi-Pass)\n",
    "\n",
    "**First Pass - Identify Candidates:**\n",
    "- Compile a list of 15-20 potential contacts with relevant titles\n",
    "- Verify they currently work at the company (check for recent activity)\n",
    "- Assess their likely influence in the buying decision\n",
    "\n",
    "**Second Pass - Gather Details:**\n",
    "- Find their LinkedIn profile URL (MANDATORY)\n",
    "- Determine their exact title and department\n",
    "- Look for email addresses (company website, GitHub, social profiles, conference materials)\n",
    "- Look for phone numbers if publicly available\n",
    "- Understand their role and why they're relevant to the product\n",
    "\n",
    "**Third Pass - Prioritization:**\n",
    "- Select the 5-10 BEST contacts (quality over quantity)\n",
    "- Ensure diversity of roles (don't just find 10 engineers)\n",
    "- Use `review_thoughts` to confirm you have the right mix\n",
    "\n",
    "## Phase 4: Documentation & Finalization\n",
    "- Use `resolve_thoughts` to mark each contact as fully researched\n",
    "- Ensure you have 5-10 high-quality contacts\n",
    "- Double-check that each contact has a LinkedIn URL (MANDATORY)\n",
    "\n",
    "# CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Always use thought management tools BEFORE searching**\n",
    "   - Plan your approach before executing searches\n",
    "   - Regularly check in with your thought list to track progress\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **LinkedIn URLs are MANDATORY**\n",
    "   - Every contact MUST have a LinkedIn profile URL\n",
    "   - This is the most critical piece of information\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Focus on decision-makers**\n",
    "   - Prioritize people who can actually say \"yes\" to a purchase\n",
    "   - Consider the company size when determining seniority level\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **5-10 contacts per company**\n",
    "   - Better to have 6 excellent contacts than 10 mediocre ones\n",
    "   - Aim for a mix of roles and seniority levels\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Explain relevance**\n",
    "   - For each contact, clearly articulate why they're relevant\n",
    "   - Connect their role to the product offering\n",
    "\n",
    "# SEARCH STRATEGY TIPS\n",
    "\n",
    "- Start with LinkedIn: \"site:linkedin.com/in [Company Name] [Title]\"\n",
    "- Check company website team/about pages\n",
    "- Look for recent company news mentioning specific people\n",
    "- Search for the company name + role on Google\n",
    "- Check if the company has an engineering blog with author bios\n",
    "- Look at recent job postings - hiring managers are often listed\n",
    "- For technical products, check GitHub for company organization members\n",
